# TODOs

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Make Requests More Difficult
- Update request generation to use **multiple conditions** instead of single conditions
- This increases task complexity for better evaluation

### 2. Implement Agent Baseline
- Create baseline method for **agent-based approaches** that delegate subtasks to subagents
- This will serve as comparison for ANoT

### 3. Implement ANoT
- Implement the ANoT (Agentic Network of Thought) method
- Core contribution of the research

## Future TODOs

### 4. Preprocessing: User-Defined Categories
- In `curate.py`, allow user to **type in the categorization** they have in mind during preprocessing
- Makes data curation more flexible
