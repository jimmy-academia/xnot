I'm not ordinarily a cappuccino person (I generally stay pretty simple with coffee), but decided to start my trip with a treat.\n\nThe space inside is relaxed and unassuming. The shop has a very large clock above the counter. Maybe it's a statement on the inexorable march of time, and how we need to all take time to enjoy life with a relaxing cup of coffee, because death is inevitable? Or maybe it's just because the space was empty and they needed to put something there.\n\nA customer in front of me asked if the house-made cookie has coconuts. The clerk went into the back to check. She came back and said no. Big props to her for taking the time to look! But that may be information the shop wants to have behind the counter. Nothing hurts business more than having a customer get a terrible food allergy from your food.\n\nThe cappuccino was lovely. Nothing adventurous, but I wasn't looking for a beverage concocted by a mythological beast, so it worked for my purposes. I appreciated the outdoor seating.

They also have this sweet onion relish, which I never usually put on hot dogs, but my friend had it on his and I had to try it. Get a carrot dog without the relish and get one with it.

West Philly with the colleges, hospitals and plenty of trees make it a kind of hip spot for new people to Philly and friendly environmentalists and at the same time staying clear of the dodgey sketchy areas that also make West Philly pretty dangerous. But for the most part there is a charm to West Philly that differs from South Philly with more industrial sites, the rustic Italian Market, the river, and the giant Ikea overlooking a huge abandoned cargo ship and a building with four smoke stacks. (As you walk around the parking lot it kind of looks like a level from Mario 64. Just odd.) And lastly North Philly with it's Fringe Bohemian crowds, art collectives and plenty of old mill buildings perfect for you and your friends to open a studio for woodcutting etc. \n\nBut back to the Green Line, I like it for it's small space, nice diverse groups, listening to some silly stories from locals, and the bashful baristas giving good service but sometimes slow on the \"Oh.... uh... thank.. you...

Very small and quaint and it was moderately busy but not crazy busy.  Line of about 4 people in front of me.  Only one single person restroom so my son used the restroom while I waited in line.  Order an iced tea with flavored syrup which ended up being $5.  Crazy.  But visiting Philly and things are sometimes pricey so okay, fine.  Girl goes to make it and realizes that coffee is spilled because the coffee pot was not put in right so she sets my tea on the top of the coffee maker and goes to clean the spill, which is fine also.  I don't mind waiting.  Waited another 5 minutes, she cleaned the spill but was doing other orders.  Also fine, I can wait.  Had my son wait in my place next to the counter while I used the bathroom as it constantly had a line.  Came out of the restroom to find all three employees looking at him like he had three heads asking what he's waiting for.  He mentions the tea and the girl who made my tea said she made it and put it on the counter and someone must have taken it.  I hear this and explain that she made the tea and put it on the coffee maker, which confuses her.  I point to the coffee maker behind her and tell her she put it there, and she looks confused again before admitting that it could possibly be my tea.  I say, \"I saw you set it there when you were cleaning up the coffee that spilled\" and it finally dawns on her that it IS my tea, and she hands it to me with a \"let me know if I forgot the syrup\" to which I replied that I saw her put the syrup in and that it was fine.  I had to add another sugar as there was not enough syrup to sweeten the iced tea, and it was fine, but I make better brewed iced tea at home.  Had I not been paying attention to what this girl was doing or been on my phone or distracted I would not have seen her make the tea and would have been left with the excuse that someone had taken it.  Maybe she was out of it but it seemed she was on something.  Maybe going to work sober is a better idea, just saying.", "date": "2017-06-26 18:55:38", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 28, "average_stars": 3.3, "yelping_since": "2013-06-10 18:17:53"}}

But, this location & the one at 45th and Locust are my two favorites.\n\nThis location is conveniently located on the 34 Trolley line, and set at the beautiful intersection of 43rd street & Baltimore Avenue - with a lovely parklet outside in the nice-weather-months.\n\nMy go-to order is a multigrain bagel (obsessed with this bagel, have had it many many many times) with cream cheese and a hot/iced coffee (depending on temperature.) The staff is charming, helpful, and all around wonderful. \n\nIf I could give 10 stars, I would. #fanboy\n\nOnly hiccup with this location is that it does not have WiFi, so it's best to do your internet-based work at the Locust location.\n\nGreen Line forever!", "date": "2016-09-08 16:28:23", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 535, "average_stars": 4.24, "yelping_since": "2012-01-15 02:05:22"}}

Terrible. The muffin was whole wheat and more like a panini than a muffin. The bacon, WAS NOT BACON! It was some tofurkey crap imitation. The shop puts a star next to their gluten free and vegan options, why not warn the omnivores that the meat their ordering is not real meat?? I'm all for experimentation and new takes on old things, just give me a little warning before I order. \n\nWifi: It's a coffee shop with 3/4 of their patrons sitting at tables on their laptops and the barista informs me there's no wifi. I would not even have come if I knew that. I guess, I should have asked before I ordered. \n\nService: When I did order my egg and bacon muffin, I was told it would be about 5 minutes. So, I took my coffee and sat outside. No one brought out my sandwich, no one even informed me it was ready. After ten minutes I walked back in to inquire and it was just sitting on the counter. By the time I bit in, the sandwich was lukewarm at best. \n\nClosest coffee shop in my neighborhood and I'm never coming back", "date": "2016-07-15 13:54:29", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 1.0, "yelping_since": "2014-07-12 10:59:51"}}

Overpriced, weak coffee is the tipple of the day, and usually there's no less than a 15 minute wait for a cup.  Oh, and if you want to pay eight dollars for tiny servings of different hipster-interpreted foods that don't fit with the rest of the cafe's concept (hummus, banh mi), you can do that too.  Snagging a chair is difficult, as you'll have to fend off young, hip mothers and their bestrollered babies, hipsters, and the occasional old salty dude to do so.  Everyone else is wearing thick, black-plastic rimmed glasses and staring at their Mac laptop.  They must all be working on the \"great American novel,\" because the place doesn't have wi-fi.\n\nIt's a shame that this place falls short in so many ways -- it's the kind of place you cheer for, that you would want to be successful (which, in at least an economic sense, it is), and to be a great spot to spend time at, especially when any alternative to the Starbucks juggernaut is welcome.\n\nIn short, this would have been a great location to have a good coffee shop at.

I had a similar experience. I understand the dogs are not allowed in coffee shops and I have smaller dogs than she has. I usually start at the door of the coffee shop waiting for down time in the shop and give the person my money in exchange for a cup of coffee. I do this all over the city, tip for the service and I have never had a problem. That way dogs don't have to come in the shop, I get my coffee and they get their sale, no laws are broken. You should never leave your dogs tied up outside anywhere especially if they are small dogs because they are very vulnerable to theft and injury.  It is an irresponsible dog owner who leaves their dogs tied up outside.\n\nNew to the area for the past two mornings at an off time when it's not crowded, I showed up and ordered coffee today the woman came out and said that she couldn't do this every day because it disrupted the flow of her shop and she wouldn't sell me coffee like this after today.  I took the money back and said thank you I will go somewhere else. Which I did. A block away is a store called milk and Honey they were very happy to sell me a cup of coffee from the doorway and said come back anytime. There is a horticultural bump out on the street in front of the greenline shop that is open to anyone to sit in. I intended to sit there from the beginning And went back and had my coffee from another vendor. It's really very unfortunate because it sounds like they're losing customers from dog owners and walkers.", "date": "2019-09-06 19:36:12", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 33, "average_stars": 3.86, "yelping_since": "2009-03-27 18:24:23"}}
