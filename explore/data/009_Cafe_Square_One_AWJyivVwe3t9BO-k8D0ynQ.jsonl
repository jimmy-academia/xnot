They said there was absolutely nothing they could do for me besides making me a new one if I came back. I was already home and told them I just wanted a refund but they couldn't do that for me. Very disappointing because the food wasn't half bad (also wasn't great either).", "date": "2022-01-18 03:54:53", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 61, "average_stars": 4.45, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 04:35:43"}}

Salads, sandwiches, and even sushi are available, plus a few snacks and pastries. La Colombe coffee and smoothies are served, too.\n\nAll of the food I've had is good here--the sushi is very fresh and the sandwiches are all made to order. Definitely try the SQ Melt--it's a loaded three-cheese grilled cheese with tomato, avocado, and bacon. Plus it's only $6.75, which is a low price for an Old City sandwich.\n\nFree Wifi is an added bonus, and there is a surprisingly large amount of seating for such a small place. However, the bathroom is out of order indefinitely, so you won't be able to sit here and drink coffee all day.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the menu in store is a little confusing--the sandwiches are listed with their base price, which is good, but some of the extra ingredients (like a fried egg on the Baconator) is misleadingly listed as being part of the sandwich, when one actually has to ask to add it on, for an extra price. Some clarification would be helpful.", "date": "2015-08-24 13:16:27", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 630, "average_stars": 3.87, "yelping_since": "2012-06-05 16:49:09"}}
