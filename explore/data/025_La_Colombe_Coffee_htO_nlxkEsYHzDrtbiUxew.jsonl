The first time I visited this location I ordered a cortado/gibraltar, excited since I hadn't had La Colombe in a year and a half, and I was feeling nostalgic. I already knew something looked wrong from the darker color of the coffee swirled in the milk. It was burnt (yes i know the color of the crema doesnt matter but it does matter if it normally is lighter and the same coffee) I drank it, but I didn't enjoy it. I probably should've said something, but alas I didn't and checked it off as a bad one-off... \n\nA few weeks later (a month maybe?) I return to the same location and decide to order an espresso. The Nizza once again. Giving it another chance to redeem itself. The barista started talking to me, asking me questions, trying to have a conversation while he was pulling the shot, maybe that's what killed it. I took my coffee and sat down with the rest of my party already having noticed that the \"crema\" was very dark, not a definite sign of \"burnt\" but i could smell it. One other person in my group also had his coffee (their regular drip) burnt as well. Even less drinkable than mine. To the point where he, a person who basically never takes anything back, took it back (which they did when they smelled it and realized it was really burnt). I had already chugged half of mine so i decided to stomach it again... \n\nMaybe they're fazing out their Nizza? And I should try their new single origin? Next time I will. Stick to the craft coffee my friends... La Colombe atmosphere is so nice, their pastries delicious, but I don't dare try their Nizza ever again at this location.

It is 2013.  It is real life where I am a girl who gave up on the feeling of ever being sufficiently caffeinated.  Long gone are the days when a simple cup of coffee could give me a flutter in my heart and some gas in my tank.  I know caffeine is a drug because it used to make me so high and by high I mean euphoric.  It is a legal drug afterall and boy was I an addict.\n\nNowadays, I settle on just functioning with a cup of coffee and Dunkin and Wawa are acceptable means to an end.  I haven't felt the surge of caffeine in years, but this week that changed.  On a quick lunch break, I was treated to the presence of Aaliyah P (who delivers a burst of energy to all who surround her anyway).  She bought me my first cup of iced coffee from La Colombe.  I was happy to see simple syrup and all sorts of fun additives to make an already cup of iced joe better.  \n\nBack at the office, I began to feel something.  That flutter in my heart that left me in my early 20's after all my all-nighters came back to me.  I didn't know I could feel this way again.

The lack of a menu (which tells you that you are only allowed the classics - the way it should be done anyway, frankly) balances out with the OK espresso shots. However, if memory serves me right, the shop uses a La Marzocco to pull its shots (WAY snobby, but in the right way).\n\nMy favorite thing about La Colombe, though, is the atmosphere. Large windows are placed opposite a warm dark wood interior, which truly provides a world that is the best of both. People-watching is a definite do here. True characters haunt this place.

I recently was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that dictates that I am not allowed to consumer gluten in any capacity, and it's been quite a struggle.

The response I received, \"Yeah, there's no bread in our coffee\", was rude, inconsiderate, and made me feel about 3 inches tall.

I almost feel like I don't need to review La Colombe, as everyone is aware of its existence.  I used to go to La Colombe often, before I saw the light of what actual quality coffee tasted like.  So I have this complex opinion about La Colombe, but I think I've kind of seen the light for what it is. \n\nFirst off, yes it's inexpensive relatively for okay coffee. But you're trading off the fact that you're not getting great coffee. The coffee itself is nothing to write home about. I'd go without it.  The espresso is good, I usually get a double macchiato or a cappuccino when I go there. I'd say that the place is fairly mechanical, and it will give you the same thing on a consistent basis.\n\nSpeaking of consistency, you will always find yourself with a long line and seating is at a premium. You'll find a lot of couples who will be ravenous in the line, send one person to get a seat, while the other waits in line. This is the name of the game, as no one is really respectful enough to wait in line together.  There's a tendency for there to be loud children with their parents, thrashing their strollers back and forth, trying to, simultaneously, annoy the shit out of you by making an obstacle course, quiet their crying child via carelessly rocking the baby without any regard to the actual problem, and keep talking about that new Dior bag that Veronica just could not live without that they just think is trite.\n\nThere's a tendency for haughty privileged middle-aged couple to boast about their 401k's loudly in front of you in hope of you hearing how successful their meaningless life is.  If you can't tell, I don't really like the fanbase that La Colombe has.  Let me put it this way:  I'm surprised I haven't seen Mary Kate Olsen talking about her Vera Wang snuggie in this joint.  I've never gotten through an hour at La Colombe without the need of rolling my eyes at some absurdity like this.\n\nI'm always amused that these people that are enthralled by expensive things go to a place where the coffee is mediocre, and could be better somewhere else by just adding a couple of quarters to the price.  I think La Colombe has a certain reputation of being amazing in Philly. I don't understand it though.\n\nIt's almost mechanical, where people expect the same cup every day when they go here, and they will get it here. The blend never changes, from what I can tell, and there's nothing truly exciting about La Colombe.  I like their carbonated water machine and almond croissant. That's about as excited as I get about this place.\n\nIn summary: If you're a douchebag that's spent all but two of their dollars on a new Michael Kors bag, and you need to go to a place to be around like minded douchebags to display your newly acquired display of \"wealth,\" get a coffee here, and put a bunch of sugar substitute and skim milk in it.

I have worked at many different coffee shops that all came from different traditions.  And as you will see if you read my review I don't like La Colombe.  My reason's are not based on grudges and I'm not trying to destroy their business.  I even include some source material in this review.  I dare other yelpers to do the same.  I hope you find my review helpful.  I also encourage people who like coffee to embrace it fully.  Coffee has seemed snobby in the past, but I assure you good coffee isn't.  Look at where the product's coming from: \"3rd-world\" nations that are typically in civil unrest and usually have to deal with very extreme natural forces (volcanos!).  These farmers are not exactly members of the financial elite.\nhere goes:\n\nSo, I'm a Philadelphian... I was born here... educated here... I grew up in the cafe culture that it has... La Colombe used to rock my world with some milk and sugar.  Then, I went to Portland to visit some family and accidentally discovered Stumptown coffee and my eyes have forever since seen the light.  After a week in Portland, I came back to La Colombe super stoked for espresso.  I noticed the difference immediately.\n\nHere's the deal, La Colombe jumped onto the early 90's coffee band wagon and made an acceptable product for the times.  They were successful in a town that never really had much to claim for coffee, as opposed to the NW, Italy, or the Nordic regions.  Being successful, they never bothered to continue and progress or refine they're product.  Nor their barista's training, which after the farmer and roaster is the last platform in pulling off noticeably incredible coffee.\n\nA lot has happened over the last decades, in coffee.  Todd Carmichael, one of the owners, has been too distracted (crossing the South Pole) and too lazy (http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/worst-coffee-trends-060210) to take heed or notice.\n\nAnd it's easy  to see the latter when you a) check out the coffee, which is bad tasting b) check out the machinery which in my years frequenting his store has NEVER BEEN CLEANED (milk encrusted steam wands) and c) has non-transparent coffee... that is that who knows where the coffee's coming from... which is deceptive and typically a hint that the coffee is grown unethically and crappy.\n\nBut hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I encourage all who will read this to check out their website (which mentions coffee that tastes like \"exclusive\" ..?.. not cocoa or berries or ...ya know, real food); check out their coffee and espresso; does it have a roast date listed? Coffee has a short sweet spot after being roasted... less than a few weeks; are their beans really oily (proof of over-roasting or being too old); see how bad and unsympathetic their baristas are.  Then go to a shop like Ultimo, Spruce Street Espresso, Bodhi, or Capogiro and notice the difference.  The craziest part about the last referenced cafe is that they use La Colombe beans and due to their care for details actually pull a half decent shot of their espresso, despite the odds.\n\nWhen you care about how a crop is farmed, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared, the product usually tastes better (coors light or yards?).  Also, pretension doesn't equal good product and the great cafes mentioned above don't mix the two.\n\nI also encourage La Colombe to do a better job and give a crap about what they do and serve.  But with owners that are this out of touch and nihilistic, I don't see that happening.  For an interesting critique on Todd Carmichael's bogus article check out Chris Tacey's review.

I get my cafe mocha in a ceramic mug since I'm planning on grabbing a table and being respectful of the planet.\n\nWe eye an empty table and snag it. I look down at my mug and the coffee looks good, a nice finishing touch with the froth. I sip my drink expecting that moment of it's going to be pretty hot, but it's going to be drinkable.  Well...turns out my coffee was not very hot at all, it was a little warmer than room temperature.  That was the first let down.  Then I take another sip, where's the mocha flavor?  The mocha is TOTALLY lacking, almost no sweetness at all to my drink.  When I order from of my usual coffee joints I usually ask for half the amount of mocha.  I don't seek out mocha because I want a drinkable candy bar so it's not that I love it overly sweet.  I just like a hint of mocha, yet this drink, no hint.

My days started and ended with La Colombe's cappuccino, enjoyed in either the Rittenhouse Square or the cafe itself. I've found only one other cafe, Cafe Trieste in Berkeley, whose cappuccino matches La Colombe's.\n\nAt first, I only studied at La Colombe. (To be honest, I still haven't found another cafe where I feel comfortable studying as I had at La Colombe. Must be something about their seating...) As I became a regular, I found myself drawn into intriguing conversations. La Colombe remains my dream cafe: an excellent team of baristas serving great beverages to interesting patrons studying, reading, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, and engaging in witty conversations.\n\n******************\n\nIn reading the reviews thus far, it seems there has been plenty of coverage about the coffee but only mostly negative feedback for the cafe. So here's my lowdown. Decide what you will:\n\n*Opens and closes early: 7am-6pm ish. There are usually a handful of people already waiting at the door before the barista is ready to open. On the weekends!\n*The baristas are amazing. The best I've seen anywhere. Incredibly efficient and fast! It helps that most patrons are regulars and know what they want. If you become a regular, the baristas will remember what you usually order and ask you if you want your usual. I varied and hence they never presumed. However, I've seen them notice regular patrons standing in line, serve up their drinks by the time the patrons reach the bar, and off the patrons simply pay and go. It reminded me of a well-choreographed dance. Tip them well if you become a regular. You may get free beverages and useful connections out of it.\n*The baristas are all very attractive. They are all people who've other lives, for which networking at La Colombe comes in handy. They know who's who. I consider them to be, to some degree, involved in the weaving of a particular Philadelphian scene. They've never snubbed me. I've never seen them snub anyone. They've always been super professional and discrete.\n*There is no menu. Can be intimidating for newcomers and those who like to know how much things cost. Order what you've liked elsewhere. The baristas will make most drinks people would ever want, and they'll let you know if they do not make/have a particular drink/ingredient. Just don't ask for soy milk. Skim is as far as they go. Remember, you're at a cafe owned by a Frenchman. Don't balk at the price. It'll be worth it.\n*The iced cappuccino is crack.\n*In terms of food, they only offer a limited quantity and variety of pastries. The almond croissants are fantastic. Less a fan of the scones. All can be gone by midday. There's a day (Mon?) when they have no pastries due to logistics. The baristas don't mind at all if you bring your own food. The regulars can be seen eating burgers from Loie's next door.\n*Only cash.\n*The place can get packed. Then, take your drink to go and stroll through Rittenhouse Square if you were planning on lingering. Or ask someone if you might share a table. People have always been obliging. Then, table hop when one becomes available. I've spent entire afternoons table hopping to my preferred spot or from one conversation to another.\n*I tend to see two types of patrons: those who want conversations (i.e. are networking/socializing) and those who want to study. If you plan to study, don't sit near the front. Sit as far away from the bar and door as possible. Generally, although not always, this is where the studious sit whereas those who want conversation, the regulars, choose tables closer to the bar and the door. Invest in noise cancelling headphones, although they'll block out the music but definitely not conversations. If you're an attractive woman or man who comes regularly, the regulars will strike up conversations with you sooner or later. If you don't want that to happen, good luck.\n*The baristas and the regulars are characters. Interesting to get to know. Consider yourself warned.\n\nLa Colombe Cafe off Rittenhouse Square can be more than just a cafe. Your experience of La Colobme, ultimately, is what you make of it. I chose to make it one of my networks/a scene. Those who prefer otherwise need not.

At La Colombe the espresso tastes  bitter and gross, the cappuccino has a nice foam but you can barely taste the coffee underneath all that milk, the regular coffee also tastes burnt and forces itself to be consumed with either milk or sugar.  Also it is very lame they don't offer soy milk. Now I don't really like regular milk, but I make an exception to drink it in coffee sometimes, on a regular basis however I would prefer to drink soy milk or I choose to drink my coffee black.  When I once inquired about why they didn't offer soy milk the barista told me the owner was a traditionalist. Hmmm interesting...  I could go on a rant about that in itself but I  won't.\n\nAll in all  I think La Colombe is the kind of place for people who have graduated up from drinking Starbucks and Dunkin'  and by that I mean they still take their coffee with lots of cream and sugar, but they still don't know what wonderful coffee can really taste like. \n\n \n***Also yes the water machine is really cool, I get it, I like it too.

Most patrons seem to know exactly what they want, so this is a coffee shop where no explanations are necessary. \n\nThe customer profile seems a little different than the regular coffee shop. They appear to be just a little more mature, just a little more sophisticated to a degree. From professional mothers to grad students studying for their upcoming exams, you'll find a subtle difference to the kinds of people filing through the door on a hectic weekday afternoon. \n\nWhen I approached the counter, the girl attending appeared to have a bit of a poor attitude, but when I heard her speak, I realized she was foreign. I appreciate friendliness more than the exoticness of the nationality of the person behind the counter, but I'm not complaining. She handed me a paper cup of the drip brew, then a lid on a dish with a spoon. I really appreciated the way they have all their sugars and creams seated in ornate pots on the front counter. But I wanted to discover the fineness of their brew unmolested by those fixings. \n\nWhen I asked the male at the counter, he told me the coffee was their \"Corsica,\" a multi-region blend. As I sipped it, the coffee seemed to be only medium bodied, with little to no acidity, and an underwhelming flavor. In fact, it seemed that it was just a little bit watery. They may want to check the proportions of their water to their coffee, because as it was, I didn't think that it was anything to get excited about. It may a few steps up from the brew they serve at Wawa, but hardly deserving of the title \"gourmet.\" \n\nThe furniture in the lobby was fitting: tiny chairs with tiled tables. I noticed their furniture actually matched the ceramic items with which they served their coffee, and that was a nice touch. The music playing in the lobby had it's moments. I prefer the nondescript drizzle of lightly thumping electronica in the background as opposed to a music selection based on the tastes of the people working there. How many times can one hear Rob Thomas and Santana's \"Smooth\" before you get tired of hanging around? \n\nOverall, La Columbe is impressive as a sole proprietorship, but as a coffee shop, it's only a notch above average. If you're in the mood for something different than your regular corporate coffee shop experience, than this is a place for you. It's not like the city has huge variety of options.", "date": "2008-02-21 19:58:42", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 3, "average_stars": 3.75, "yelping_since": "2008-02-06 07:59:35"}}

This location is in the heart of Rittenhouse but this espresso bar is not one of my favorite.  Came here with out of town family and found it strange to find no menu anywhere in sight. There were long lines so do they just know exactly what to order?? Were they all regulars?? It just felt strange.  I just ordered a medium ice coffee since I know they must have that...right? \n\nFunny thing was, my husband and brother in law ordered the macchiato thinking it was a drink.  What they got was a shot of expresso instead.  Since it was our first time here...who knew? We were comparing it to Starbucks....which is not a good idea!\n\nAlso, I was looking for the restroom and since they had a long line....I didn't want to interrupt the staff.  I started to proceed to the only door I saw that had no sign what's so ever.  I didn't know if it was a door to the basement or closet....Jeesh! I think it would be helpful to have some sign for those out of Towner's or non-regulars. \n\nAlso, my 7yr old ordered hot chocolate but she complained it wasn't the same as her regular hot chocolate from Starbucks.  I tasted it and it had no sugar what's so ever. The server should have informed us since he saw that this was for a child.  Since we already left the spot, I had to make my way to another coffee house....and it happen to be Starbucks that was close by!", "date": "2014-07-23 20:06:26", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 74, "average_stars": 4.01, "yelping_since": "2013-12-17 04:32:22"}}

It really focuses on the coffee, and I'm a tea person, not a coffee person.  I'd appreciate more effort on tea too.  It doesn't take much effort to stock a handful of high-quality loose-leaf teas along with coffee (tea is easier to prepare well than coffee, IMHO), but this place doesn't even seem to try, it just wants to be all about its coffee.\n\nIs the coffee here good?  Ehh.  I do drink coffee, and I have opinions on it, although I'm certainly no expert.  I will say, the stuff I've had here is good, but it is not the best coffee I've had.  In order to justify its coffee-snobbery, I think this place would have needed to really like, AMAZE me with their coffee, and they failed to do this.\n\nI do like that La Colombe does direct trade -- that's great.  I'm also a big fan of shade-grown coffee, both for the taste and because I like the ecological principles behind it, but currently, I have yet to sample or even see for sale a single shade-grown coffee from this company.  Supposedly they have one in their \"workshop\", but I have yet to try it.  This company is lagging behind others, there are so many good shade grown coffees on the market.\n\nWhat about the ambiance in this particular shop?  I don't like it.  The walls are red, and it feels...for lack of a better descriptor, arid, conjuring up images of parts of the American Southwest or drier parts of the Mediterranean.  It doesn't feel cozy or comforting to me.\n\nThere's also a sort of weird vibe here that I don't like.  One of my friends articulated it to me, that there's a long line of people who seem to know a lot about coffee and know exactly what they want.  The people working the counter are nice, but when I've been in here, it's been busy and high-pressure, you get to the front of the line and you don't have time for chit-chat.  I don't like that sort of vibe.  I'd rather go to a sort of friendly, down-to-earth cafe that offers a few shade-grown coffees and has a good tea selection too, a place where I can chat with the people behind the counter a bit without feeling like I'm imposing on the people behind me.\n\nAnd lastly, the baked goods?

My fellow Yelpers are greatly divided in their reviews of La Colombe of late. It seems as if a lot of the negative reviews are due to either the clientele, or the fact that the coffee is not that good (due to the hype?), or the place hasn't changed with the times as Americans become more and more particular about their coffee. My take is that I like this place. I like the coffee and the staff, and thankfully, have not had to deal with all of the A-holes, D-bags, and Upper Middle Class J-offs that heaps of a Yelpers have been crying about. Trust me, I can be as cantankerous and bitter about uppity wankers, but usually I speak up, and just tell them to shut up. I show up to La Colombe at odd hours, and am never here during a mad rush. I don't live in Philly, and am usually in Rittenhouse in the afternoon, and early evening, so my only pissy gripe is that they (understandably) close at 7pm. And that the bathrooms are sometimes filth pits. \n\nI do agree that La Colombe's coffee isn't the best I've ever had, but its WAY above average. One fellow reviewer stated that he's seen steaming wands crusted with milk, and that the baristas never clean the machines. I disagree. I've seen, the guys and gals that work there take care in what they do. I also ask them questions, and everyone I have spoken to has been extremely helpful. Granted they are not slammed with a million customers at this point. Also, my only order when I go is an espresso. Single, double, or triple. I really don't drink a whole bunch of frothy milk products, so I can't tell you if they do that well or not. The espresso is definitely pulled well, and certainly not the best, but blows most places out of the water. I have been to many European coffeehouses in places such as Austria, France, Italy, and Hungary that have been operating for generations, and have had coffee equal to or inferior to La Colombe. I think coffee can also be a very subjective topic like the cheese steak. Everyone has their opinion of what is the best, and their criteria is almost always different than your own. Anyway, La Colombe usually does the trick for me, and the sparkling water machine is a real plus.", "date": "2011-06-23 14:44:10", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 73, "average_stars": 4.05, "yelping_since": "2010-11-19 18:05:16"}}

That's it. yes, they have some snacks, but it's abut the coffee. No, they don't have WiFi, it's about the coffee.  it's a coffee shop.  If you want an extended menu with choices, if you want designer coffees with bizarro flavors, then go someplace else..if you want cheese and fruit snacks with your coffee, go elsewhere.... if you want a mini-coffee, or a mega-coffee, then go some place else.. they have \"one size fits all\".......here, it is about the coffee. Robust, full-flavored and without the inherent bitterness of a major national coffee chain that will remain unmentioned........you can buy coffee beans, either relying on their standard \"house blends\" or turn to their more experimental efforts at new and textured blends. \n\nI hit this place on the way to work, getting my lattes to fuel my early work processes.... the line can be 20 deep, but the servers move with lethal speed and courtesy, and that twenty-person line takes less time than a five-person line elsewhere. Could it be because it is about the coffee?  It is my understanding that the founders have restored a way of roasting coffee beans that maintains the robust flavor, but removed bitter aftertastes... which explains the range of choices, explains why their coffee is featured at numerous restaurants in Philly and why, as they expand their network of shops, they continue to succeed.  I have the fortune to use their coffe shops in NYC and in Chicago due to repeat business travel, and marvel at the clarity of continuity - great coffee, efficient service and more great coffee.\n\nAs a sidebar, their coffee is sourced by the original owners -  and they work to source through fair trade practices, thus allowing me to serve this coffee at home to my Quaker wife, for whom fair trade practices are essential...\n\nDid I mention that it is about the amazing quality of coffee?", "date": "2015-12-23 19:08:36", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 12, "average_stars": 3.79, "yelping_since": "2010-08-02 15:03:43"}}

I chose La Colombe to kill time before a 7pm meeting. Walked in at 6:50 (I was unaware they close at 7). Talk about attitude!! If you have a problem with customers arriving at 6:50, lock the fucking door or change your closing time to something more feasible to your needs. I ordered an iced decaf (I am sensitive to caffeine, so a decaf coffee to me is the equivalent to a regular)\nThe barista making the coffee then proceeded to throw a temper tantrum, flailing his arms and acting like my coffee was such a HUGE inconvenience to him. Then another customer asked him how he was doing and he responded by saying- I was fine until I got slammed at the last minute and i'm pissed because I want to go home and all my machines have been cleaned and now I have to clean them again. He was directing this to ME!!! How immature!!! If a business is opened until 7, they should prepare to be opened until 7. And if you have a problem with it, close your business earlier or shut your mouth!!! Or SAY IT TO MY FACE, not indirectly to the customer next to me. Way too much attitude from somebody serving coffee, get over yourself buddy. I will stick to Good Karma for my coffee where I don't get a side of attitude with my cup. Oh and the best part of this all is that the jerk-off gave me a super caffeinated coffee, just to be a DICK. I took one sip and my heart started to race, I couldn't even finish it.

I am a fan of La Colombe over Joe or Elixir. Elixir's coffee just wasn't that great and Joe's latte cost me an arm! \n\nNow, I'm not going to rave about their coffee for too long (lots of posts about that on here I'm sure) because I'm usually a drinker of decaf. I am super sensitive to caffeine and regret it every time I order \"full caff\" coffee.  I try to be super woman though and think I can take it. I was too excited to try their ice draft coffee (something they just started offering in the past couple of months and no they don't offer it in decaf) and was jittery within an hour.  Don't let la colombe's 12 ounce cup size full you. I feel that smaller serving of coffee from la Colombe packs the same amount of caffeine as a 16 ounce pike place roast at Starbucks. \n\nNow what I do want to rave about and my FAVORITE drink here, is their HOT CHOCOLATE!!! This is hands down the best hot chocolate I've had from a coffee shop! Usually other places make it with chocolate syrup or that nasty cocoa mix made with powdered milk or some kind of hydrogenated milk solids and tons of sugar! I am lactose intolerant so powdered milk is no no for my stomach. La Colombe's hot chocolate is like a cocoa powder latte! I get it made with almond milk. It comes totally unsweetened. I add a bit of simple syrup to sweeten it. It makes the perfect true dairy free dark hot chocolate! I wish I can just mix almond milk and cocoa powder at home but alas, the steamed almond milk makes it.\n\nThe baked goods here are delicious, too, although they are expensive. I like the chocolate croissants. My coworker is a big fan of their chocolate chip cookie but it's a hard cookie with hard chocolate chips that stick to your teeth. I prefer mine chewy and gooey.\n\nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars is I agree with another reviewer about the less than inviting ambience. The hipster male baristas aren't the most open or personable. They seem too busy or coffee-snobbish to chat with you or make eye contact. I always feel pressured to order fast. There's also no menu, prices, cup sizes, or explanation of what the weird coffee apparatuses on display are, so if you're new here, the vibe makes you feel like a total uninitiated noob. Maybe a lot of people feel this way, so they just stick to ordering the same thing every time. It makes the line move faster.

You used to be one of my favorite coffeehouses and I used to beam with anticipation every time I got ready to take a cup of your coffee into Rittenhouse Square.

But often times as Nate says I get a snobby server with a high and mighty attitude. um, your pouring me a cup of coffee! maybe you should send them to one of the other cafes that sale your brand so they can learn to get a better server attitude.\n\nYeah. your still one of the best. And in a lot of ways you helped shape the indie coffee scene that's is so prevalent in Philly. So you earned the right to have some off days, just not as many as you've been having. look around you and you'll see a ton of coffee places that are stepping up their game better than you are.
