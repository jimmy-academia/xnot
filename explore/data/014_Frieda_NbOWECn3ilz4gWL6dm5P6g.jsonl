By the time you order, you have fallen completely in love with this small cafe. My mama ordered a delicious avocado toast with poached eggs. While I ordered a savory mushroom toast with fried eggs.

Its primary identity may be a restaurant, but they often flip the space for workshops, readings, and other cool classes. They sell amazing local goods by local makers, and I love their statement about their artists, bakers and employees: \"And while you're here, know that any money you spend at FRIEDA helps us create fair-wage jobs for people of all generations - many of them retired, but still needing to work to make ends meet - as well as support our Outreach Community Program.\"\n\nFOOD + DRINK: Reasonably priced and crave-worthy. The salmon avocado toast was beautifully presented, had delicious flavor and was very generous. As for bakery, my Mom and I both agreed their croissant was the best we've ever had. Thick but still flaky and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate. The London Fog and other coffee drinks we had were always well-made and satisfying.\n\nSERVICE + VIBE: Nahir is amazing. I actually hugged him on my final visit! We had so many great chats about Frieda's programs, the menu, and just Philly in general. He went above and beyond. The vibe here is very white and minimal, but open and airy.

Their pastries are made on the spot, often in view of the cafe. I love watching them make their cakes and sweet delicacies. There's quite an art to it. My favorite sandwiches are a toss up: some days it's the curry chicken wrap; others it's the turkey with their delicious Frieda chutney. I've become such a regular that the staff greets me warmly and knows I'll be asking for a hot chai latte. Oh yes, their looseleaf teas and lattes are great as well!\n\nTheir motto is CONNECTING GENERATIONS. This is the second part of Frieda I was curious about. I didn't understand, so I asked staff to explain. They offer a great space for people to come and play games. There's frequently a table or 3 of ladies playing Mahjong around 1 PM on weekdays. They also have sign-up sheets on the front wall near the door. They have a movie club, book club, German- and French-language clubs...really, this place has it all.

Never go there again!!\nI was there for a friend catch up. It took me awhile to get there, and when I walked in I asked if I can use the bathroom first before I order because I REALLY HAVE to use the bathroom immediately! An old woman there stopped me and insisted on me ordering first. Even after I told her I will definitely order but just really need to use the bathroom now. She said - \"well many people just use the bathroom and left. You need to order first. What if you use the bathroom and leave?\" And she was standing between me and the way to bathroom like she is using her body to protect her bathroom...WTF?!? So stupid - only allow customers to use the bath is strange but still understandable, but what do you mean you don't trust that I will order later? I wonder what has happened to you in life so that you don't even trust people on the smallest thing like this? She was the front page lady on their ads and website. Shame on you frieda\n\nOpened up my Yielp account to comment on this.

Very mediocre. I had quiche with a very lightly dressed green salad (actually think it was just oil on the lettuce, nothing more) and my husband had an omelette which came with a tiny cup of inedible brown fruit salad. I also didn't like that all of the plates, cups, cutlery were disposable. It's hard to cut a quiche with what is effectively a popsicle stick. And I hate thinking about the amount of garbage this restaurant generates.\nThe wait staff were pleasant though", "date": "2021-09-18 15:16:34", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 33, "average_stars": 3.36, "yelping_since": "2013-08-17 22:19:43"}}
