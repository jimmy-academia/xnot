It had the salty cured meats and hard cheese that you find all over Barcelona with some lettuce and aioli on a fresh roll. However, the roll was extremely hard to bite into. Not stale, but just a REALLY hard roll, which made eating the sandwich difficult. P also got the split pea soup, which came in a huge container topped with bacon and cr\u00e8me fraiche.

I used to frequent this place at least once a week because I work around the corner.

The coffee was made on the spot but I waited more than 30 minutes for my sandwich.  During those thirty + minutes, four orders came out.  Four.  And one of those was a caviar delivery.  Think about that for a minute.  These weren't huge orders.  One was a single take out.  The caviar order was a single bag, not sure how many sandwiches were in there but not more than 2-3.  Another was a family of three eating in.  Another was a single sandwich eating in.  So in more than thirty minutes, that kitchen managed to crank out 1 salad, and somewhere between 3 and 5 sandwiches.  That is pathetic.  That is not a kitchen under strain.  That is an incompetent kitchen. \n\nWhen I got my sandwich, it was a long way from the quality that used to be expected there.  Though it's worth noting that this place has never served a sandwich worth waiting 30 minutes for.  I got one of my old standards, the New Orleans.  But this time there was too much jam (like waaaaay too much) and very little meat.\n\nI'm not sure I'll be going back.  This long wait was my longest to date but the place has been trending that way for some time (weekday lunch was becoming a regular 20 minutes but that was far more crowded than today).\n\nSo I've eaten my last sandwich from these people.

It indeed is good enough, but for show-stopping coffee, I prefer La Colombe's & Elixr's when in the area.\n\nI ordered breakfast and lunch together as to go.

The menu consists of many sandwiches, with a few other dishes as well, and breakfast options including sandwiches, granola, and some egg dishes. So far, everything I've tasted has been delicious, without anything being too heavy or gluttonous that it'll ruin your day. \n\nThe PLENTY BREAKFAST SANDWICH takes your typical breakfast wich to the next level by piling sausage, eggs, and cheese on a buttery and sweet brioche bun! This wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed having a few bites of my boyfriends. \n\nThe EGG WHITE is my current favorite breakfast sandwich. A lighter take on a breakfast sandwich with flavors I wouldn't expect for breakfast. Egg whites are topped with diced grilled squashes, slices of avocado, roasted red pepper aioli, and pecorino cheese to add a unique twist to the sandwich. It's served on the multigrain, which is my favorite. The bread is thin, but lightly toasted to give it the perfect chew, with seeds in the bread that give it a scrumptious texture and flavor.\n\nThe CHICKEN SALAD is my current favorite lunch sandwich. It's unlike your typical mayo-y, deli chicken salad - this refreshing chicken salad contains large pieces of chopped chicken with celery, sweet cranberries, and a whole grain mustard mayo that isn't applied too heavily. The lighter-take on everyone's favorite is served with tomato and greens on the multigrain bread!\n\nI enjoyed the GENOA sandwich, but it wasn't my favorite. The roasted chicken is pulled and lightly tossed in pesto, and topped with roasted red peppers, tomato, pecorino, and artichoke aioli.  I can't speak to the bread, as I had it on the multi-grain (of course :P). I wish there were more pesto or aioli, as it ate a little dry and would have benefitted from some more sauce. \n\nAnother delicious option is the HOUSE GRANOLA & YOGURT, which could be perfect any time of day. I'm not one to typically order this while out, since you can pretty much make it at home, but this was executed perfectly and I'd order it again. There it was a perfect ratio of ingredients, with a balance of granola and yogurt that was unmatched. Every bite had a perfect combination of both. The toppings added sweetness, crunchiness, and freshness, and I will certainly be ordering this again. \n\nI hope to try more of their sandwiches soon - I have my eye on the New Orleans and the Barcelona, but they seem a bit heavier so I've been waiting for the perfect day to order those. \n\nThere's a reason (well, many actually) that I come back here time and time again.

I reached out to management a week ago and they have been completely nonresponsive and negligent. I really wanted to leave the cafe name out of this because the situation is more important than the location, but I'm afraid they have given me no choice. I would like to protect future patrons from experiencing the same. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was at Plenty Cafe, a place I used to go to and study out of often. This is my story: \n\nIt's finals week. Last night, I was working out of a caf\u00e9 I go to often. A cafe known for being open late that many people use to study. It was late, and I was the only one in the space. At around 10, a group of three came into the space speaking loudly, above what one would consider normal. I turned to them and asked if they could keep it down a bit and they began to attack me.\n\nThe \"gentleman\", proceeded to yell at me. I responded by saying, it was just a question. I just asked a question. Then when he continued to harp on it, I insisted that I politely asked a question. Then he kept yelling \"shut the fuck up\". I defended myself and told him that he didn't need to say that to me and that I didn't need to \"shut up\". He then proceeded to call me a twat and insisted he was a gentleman for not breaking out the \"C\" word. Upon defending myself he told me that I had \"control issues\" and proceeded to yell at me and ask me if I was going to cry. I then told him that how he acts is on his conscious, and continued to work on my paper.\n\nI refused to let someone terrorize me into leaving the space. I stayed, worked on my paper. While I was working he kept making up stories about my life with his buddies. First insisting that my loud typing was me talking to my boyfriend and then taking it back saying I probably didn't have a boyfriend. Then later saying that I didn't have friends. While upset, I kept working. I wasn't going to let him intimidate me. So I just ignored him and kept going. Upon leaving he talked about what else he could do to provoke me but ultimately left me alone. He then proceeded to complain about what had happened with the staff. After the group had left, the wait staff said nothing. I stayed until close, thanked them, and still nothing.\n\nSince the election, I've felt afraid - as a woman and as a minority. I know there are bad people in this world, and while this upsets me, what upsets me more is that no one on the staff said anything. The older man was aggressively yelling \"shut the fuck up\" and \"twat\". At first I thought, well awkward situation to put yourself in the middle of but even after they left, no one asked me \"Are you ok?\" \"I'm sorry that happened\". They were silent. Silence is compliance.\n\nThese acts of hatred against women, against minorities, against LGBTQ, are happening all over the country. If you see something happening, please don't be quiet. Say something. At the very least, ask the person if they are ok.", "date": "2016-12-21 20:49:19", "useful": 10, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 143, "average_stars": 3.59, "yelping_since": "2009-01-10 21:31:50"}}

I have been here a couple times now with similar experiences. The guy at the counter was pretty unfriendly and cold me to...I don't know if it was maybe that I took to long to look at the menu? Not sure...but he was extremely friendly to everyone after me so I don't know what I did - I'm sorry I'm not a regular but you can still at least be civil! I ordered the \"new Orleans\" and sat down with my book. 30 minutes later (yes. 30.) I thought I'd check on it, they literally just looked at me at said \"oh. Yea....ready in a minute\". (Place was not busy at all) Clearly forgotten and unapologetic. Another 5-8 minutes later the sandwich arrived with a halfhearted apology and a card for a free coffee. Thanks I guess ? Sandwich was quite good, though I still think the prices are a little high here. \n\nI should also mention my previous experience. Ordered the breakfast brisket sandwich and friend ordered bagel and lox/cream cheese. That also took about 20-25 minutes (not busy). Mine came first so I tried to take little bites till my friend got hers...never came and I was over half way through mine. Checked on hers and it was forgotten. No apology. Finally hers came and the guy said to me wait yours is the wrong brisket sandwich - after a lot of back and forth I said no this is the right one (they also have a different lunch/dinner brisket sandwich) but he literally tried to take my half eaten sandwich from in front of me because he was convicted I was wrong I had the wrong one. Really? Even if it was wrong are you really going take it from me at this point? \n\nI'm sorry...these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth.

I parked the car illegally and stood watch while my partner in crime ran inside for breakfast sandwiches. \n\nMy choice was the pancetta hash, with two fried eggs, pancetta, breakfast potatoes, and fontina. We got home and tore open our packages. Mine came in a cardboard to-go box, and when I opened the lid the first thing I noticed was the pool of egg yolk covering the entire bottom of the box, leaving the whole underside of my sandwich completely soaked and really messy. Meanwhile, the roll was really tough and also very large, and it overpowered (what was left of) the ingredients in the sandwich. If you do feel compelled to order the pancetta hash to go after reading this, be sure to order it with scrambled eggs. \n\nThis was my first time ordering breakfast at Plenty; normally I have sandwiches and almost always the tasso ham panini, which is incredible.

We sat by the window at a little bar and they had just a ton of flowers at the bar, I and other patrons were having allergies as a result(and I usually love flowers). As more people piled in, the slowness behind the counter was really felt as everyone was just basically piled at the counter and front of the store, spilling into the area we were sitting. It took a pretty long time for our food to come out. They also didn't take names for orders, so everything was really disorganized and confusing. They forgot my husband's coffee for a pretty long time. Servers and staff behind the counter were not friendly, but honestly, try to consider how you'd feel if 20 impatient/hungry/thirsty people were all waiting for you. If anything, it seems like the place is understaffed and the layout compounds the issue.\n\nIn spite of all that, the food was truly wonderful. This was my favorite breakfast we had while we were in Philly. My husband had the frittata and I had the baked cheese(trying to stick to a lower carb option). The coffee was really good too, unlike a few other places we visited in the area.\n\nAs I read the first part of my review back to myself, it sounds more like 3 stars, but honestly the food is just that good. If you go in, just go in with a lot of patience and compassion for the folks working the understaffed counter, and take your food to go.

Dry and semi-sweet. \n- Olives: I loooove olives. This was one of the most unique olives ever as it had picked cucumbers and random vegetables.

By grown-up cafe, I mean this is cafes only designed for executives and CEOs. \n- It's lofted so if you wanna look down at people and work upstairs, that's an option. \n- Staff is chill and helpful. \n- There's wifi. I resent cafes that don't have wifis. Luckily, I don't have that problem here. \n- Outlets: generous and convenient locations for outlets. This is my other let peeve for cafes. Luckily, I also don't have that problem here.\n- There are 2-3 chairs of outdoor seating. On a nice sunny day, great spot to sit and people watch and hang out with people. \n- Wait time for foodrink arrival: almost immediate\n- Wait time for our check: have to pay before getting the drinks", "date": "2018-04-27 20:00:41", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 56, "average_stars": 4.16, "yelping_since": "2014-05-29 03:30:35"}}
