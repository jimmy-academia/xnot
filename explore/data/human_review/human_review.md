## 1. Unknown_0

**Firsthand Severe:** 0

**Safety Trajectory:** stable

**False Assurance:** 0

**Consensus:** 0.00

**Final Risk:** 4.0 → Low Risk

**Reasoning:** None of the reviews describe a personal severe allergic reaction or explicit allergy-safety assurances. There is no clear temporal pattern of allergy incidents to indicate improvement or deterioration. Because allergy-specific discussions are absent, there is no consensus data on safety, but the overall signal suggests low risk based on available review content.

## 2. Unknown_1

**Firsthand Severe:** 0

**Safety Trajectory:** stable

**False Assurance:** 0

**Consensus:** 0.50

**Final Risk:** 2.0 → Low Risk

**Reasoning:** No reviews describe a first-person severe allergic reaction at the restaurant. There are no clear allergy-safety claims that were later contradicted by adverse events, so there is no apparent trend of improvement or deterioration in allergy safety (trajectory appears stable). The dataset provides no allergy-focused incidents or assurances to conflict, suggesting low measured risk, though explicit allergen-control details are not described in the reviews.

## 3. Unknown_2

**Firsthand Severe:** 0

**Safety Trajectory:** stable

**False Assurance:** 0

**Consensus:** 0.00

**Final Risk:** 2.0 → Low Risk

**Reasoning:** None of the 50 reviews describe a first-person severe allergic reaction, allergy safety claims, or related management changes. There is no allergy-specific evidence to indicate risk or improvement, so the safety context appears neutral and stable. With no incidents or explicit allergy concerns reported, the overall risk is low.

**Human Assessment:** [ ] ✓ Correct  [ ] ✗ Incorrect  [ ] ? Uncertain

## 4. Unknown_3

**Firsthand Severe:** 0

**Safety Trajectory:** stable

**False Assurance:** 0

**Consensus:** 0.50

**Final Risk:** 6.5 → Low Risk

**Reasoning:** No reviews describe a personal severe allergic reaction at this restaurant. Reviews focus on food, service, and ambiance with no explicit allergy-safety claims or incidents. The pattern suggests stability in allergy-safety perception, but there is little data to confirm strong safety measures or notable improvements.
