    "reasoning": "No reviews describe a first-person severe allergic reaction at the restaurant. There are no clear allergy-safety claims that were later contradicted by adverse events, so there is no apparent trend of improvement or deterioration in allergy safety (trajectory appears stable). The dataset provides no allergy-focused incidents or assurances to conflict, suggesting low measured risk, though explicit allergen-control details are not described in the reviews."

    "reasoning": "None of the 50 reviews describe a first-person severe allergic reaction, allergy safety claims, or related management changes. There is no allergy-specific evidence to indicate risk or improvement, so the safety context appears neutral and stable. With no incidents or explicit allergy concerns reported, the overall risk is low."

The pattern suggests stability in allergy-safety perception, but there is little data to confirm strong safety measures or notable improvements."
