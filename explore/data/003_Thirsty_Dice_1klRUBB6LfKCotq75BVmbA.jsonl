We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \n\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \n\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \n\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \n\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \n\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.", "date": "2019-02-14 14:24:54", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 62, "average_stars": 3.05, "yelping_since": "2013-02-19 18:17:23"}}

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there's another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn't it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left.

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don't do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would've liked to end the evening. \n\nOverall: Great concept, and I'll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\n\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we'll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\n\nI only didn't give a whole 5 stars because I wasn't wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it's not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn't know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don't eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn't really know what to do. \n\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn't hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn't hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \n\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\n\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee. But I want to be clear that it was not exorbitant - please, visit this place. It's worth it. Just don't go in with the expectation that it's on the frugal way to spend a night out. Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \n\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \n\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn't say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \n\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \n\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It's up to you!\" Of course it's up to us, but a little direction would have been nice. Even when one of our party mentioned an example of a game she'd played before and asked if there was anything similar we never got a straight answer, so we kind of gave up and she picked something she had played before to start us off. \n\nIf you're like me and haven't played many board games, I would do some research beforehand so you know what to grab when you get there.

We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \n\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \n\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who's worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner's chicken and waffles was cold and bland. Yet again, had to call over another person to get it remade. \n\nI really believe the place has potential! To be around a year and a half already it's clearly doing something right.

Can't be seated if the whole party isn't there and they give your reservation up if you're not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late. Since it was late in the evening they let them sit down without me there. This isn't some five star restaurant so I don't see why this is all necessary. \n\nOur board game expert person introduced himself at the beginning and explained how it works and that he can help us choose stuff and play the games if needed.

That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \n\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each.

He also never came by to clear used cups and dishes, and having extra table space when playing a board game seems reasonable...To top it all off, tip was included  so our server made away with a decent tip even though he more or less ignored us and did everything wrong the whole night. \n\nThe one nice thing was that they didn't kick us out after the 2.5 hr listed time limit.

Services is nearly absent, they're understaffed and mismanaged in the front of house and would probably benefit from a POS system that sent orders straight to the kitchen from the patrons themselves to cut out the middle man. Service could be provided by staff or ping the table when an orders ready for pickup. You're paying for the the time there and I've consistently waited lengthy times for food, drink and game service while there trying to find a server or game master", "date": "2021-07-27 23:15:14", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 4, "average_stars": 2.75, "yelping_since": "2019-06-21 17:14:10"}}

Granted we were playing D&D the Game Sommelier came up immediately and knew we were playing D&D as soon as he looked at our table as we were setting up. He said he knew alot and wouldn't mind helping us out if we had questions which was Awesome.\n\nOur waitress was very nice and checked up on us at good times during our 2.5 hrs there.\n\nI gave this place 3 stars because, at one point, while I was paying attention to the DM of our game the waitress placed my drink on the table next to me, not saying a thing. As soon as I turned back to my position  I knocked my drink over. I apologized for the mess and we started cleaning up.\n\nThe waitress came over and told me that because I spilled the drink and it was not her I would have to pay for a new one. I was a little shocked in that information and just replied with an okay. She walked away with the dirty rags and the mess and came back and asked if I wanted another which I said no.\n\nIt was a 6 dollar soda that I didn't have a chance to drink that I would have to pay for. I definitely was not going to pay for a second one.\n\nThe waitress later in came back and and said she would give me another one for free because she felt bad because she hadnt said anything to me when she placed it down therefore I didnt know it was there. \n\nEverything was fun and welcoming other than that moment. \n\nThat was very nice of her. However, this being a custom of this establishment makes me wary of getting anything if I were to return. \n\nI work in a Starbucks and if someone drops a drink, no matter how or why, I remake it for free. At restaurants if you drop your food or drink it's remade for free. Or just taken off the check.\n\nKnowing that if I were to spill my drink by accident here I would have to pay for that spilled drink and, if im thirsty, a new one is ridiculous and to me poor customer service.", "date": "2019-12-15 04:59:22", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 3.0, "yelping_since": "2019-12-15 04:45:09"}}

There is a $7 per person sitting fee, but this place has over 800 games and there is no limit to how long you can stay so the $7 is totally worth it. \n\nThirsty Dice has a very knowledgeable staff who are all more than happy to help you pick a board game or walk you through all of the rules. The games are color coded to let you know their level of difficulty, whether or not they are good for two players, and if it is a \"gateway game\" to a genre of games. \n\nThirsty Dice also has a good selection of food and beverages (including beer, wine, game-inspired cocktails, and boozy milkshakes). We tried the spicy mix (think of a spicy Chex Mix, but with Goldfish and pretzels) and it was good, but kind of small, but given the $3 price tag, you can't ask for much more. We also tried the classic flatbread pizza. The pizza was amazing, but a lot smaller than I was anticipating. It costs $7 so I probably won't get it again. A few people around me had the mac and cheese and it looks incredible, so I will definitely try that the next time I swing by. \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time at Thirsty Dice. This place is great for groups of all sizes, but I would say it is more adult-oriented so I wouldn't bring kids here (although they do have a great selection of kids board games that will make you very nostalgic).

First off, their brunch deal is a joke! I think it's $36 for 6 mimosas, an entree, and game time. The mimosas were disgusting. All orange juice. My boyfriend even got a double screw driver and it was so bad. Even outside of brunch, their drink cocktails are gross! And they're pricey. The food was fine, but afterwards my whole party felt sick - don't know if the food upset our tummy or the straight OJ we drank. \n\nThe service was terrible.

We were next to the front door on a winter night (hello chill!) so we kept our jackets on. But it was certainly doable! \nOur server was friendly and knowledgeable. I love the gluten free options available! I was finally able to dine with the best of them! \nThe pizza (served in an opened baguette) was so delicious- the fresh mozzarella cheese is one for the books! Who know an Italian like me would love the pizza from a board game restaurant!! I also got the pork and broccoli rabe Mac and cheese- and holy moly it was cheesy upon cheesy!! I wish it had larger pieces of pork and broccoli! It felt more like cheese soup than Mac and cheese. \nWe got the butter popcorn (yum) and then the Parmesan truffle popcorn (which was the butter pop corn doused with seasoning.. not my fave). \nThe banana milk shake/beverage was a hit among my friends and I!! \nFood was a long wait- this is why I can't give a 5. Even just napkins took almost 10 mins to obtain. \nOur \"game-tender\" (instead of bar-tender... get it?) was George- he suggested some great games!! We all like puzzle and trivia so we went with Concept! And the Rummikub! Well worth the $5/person/2.5hr fee. \nI just love how this place blends games and food!

They are doing a good job in regards of who they're hiring.  \n\nDrink selection is also good, didn't have any food (besides the popcorn) - but this place isn't cheap.

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\n\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good. There were also some drinks and milkshakes that we didn't get to taste, but looked amazing.

It's easy enough to go out and get a few drinks, but why not have some fun that is stiumulating? You know, actually use a few brain cells rather than kill them? \n\nEnter the Thirsty Dice!\n\nI am not sure how I came across this bar, but I found it online a few days before my most recent trip to Philly and made a note that I WAS going to go. Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\n\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\n\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always. Though crowded, the hostess had us seated in less than 5 minutes when she saw two chairs available and made a very obvious effort to get us settled ASAP. Yesss!
