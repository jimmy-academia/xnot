I love the interior! Everything on the menu so far has been really good, and I like that it's vegan/vegetarian friendly. I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\n\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It's hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It's not the same person every time, either, so maybe it's just the mood/shtick they're going for??\n\nAlso, whether I'm the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \n\nThese have been problems consistently every time I've gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend. He actually really doesn't like it here because of the service, but I come back a lot because I love everything else, and it isn't so bad that I can't just deal. \n\nTLDR; The ambience and hot drinks are great. Service questionable and often slow, but not unbearable.

Is a niche! \nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\n\nThe answer to that? Just step inside. \n\nIf you are a resident to the Fishtown/Kensington hood this will be one of your independent coffee shops of choice. Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren't any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\n\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \n\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it's roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn't expect are friendly. \n\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you've seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there's fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there's going to be some douchy people lining up. \n\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it's space. It's very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone's laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \n\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you're bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you'll get...\n\n\"Uhhhh... I'm sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \n\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it's still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \n\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.

When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\n\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\n\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \n\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \n\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \n\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \n\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\n\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \n\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \n\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\n\n\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \n\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

I wandered in today, a very very nice day and got a cafe mocha and \"angel\" cookie(The server called it a conut(cookie/doughnut, and that was very appropriate). The cafe mocha was tasty as was the conut.  A welcome treat on a nice day.\n     \n     The decor is hard to explain. Its kind of arty/kind of old student house shabby but in a good way. An example is their bathrooms, which have what appears to be handpainted signs with \"Onion\" and \"Garlic\" on them. There is plenty of character as opposed to the sterile corporate interior design of Starbucks or some of the other chain stoors. The cafe has nice wood floors and plenty of seating. Decoration/paintings here and there. Lots of colors. Good music on the stereo, though today it was mostly \"Juno\"esque/grrrl rock(which the server was singing to. She wasn't half bad either).  There is a soda fountain type curved bar area where you can sit on stools which is kind of cool.\n      As far as computing goes,Rocket Cat had an old Blue Mac G4 for you to check e-mail/stuff on the internet. It appears that they had wireless, though I didn't have my laptop with me so I can't confirm my suspicions. I also didn't see too many electric plugs so you'll have to forage around for one if you want to stay there for any length of time.\n\n     The Cafe also had plenty of board games for you to while away your time. One little secret gem that I don't think the previous reviewers mentioned is that there is a small seating area in the back outside! Totally cool. I sat outside drinking coffee and smelling the flowers and listening to the birds chirp.  It felt like my own private park.\n\n    The food looked pretty good but I didn't have any.

I want to like it, but time after time I feel let down.  Today I met some friends there and although we were having a great conversation, we had to leave after 45 minutes because it was stifling and humid inside the cafe.  There were ceiling fans, but they do little when it is already 95 degrees.  I thought maybe the AC was broken, but looked around and didn't see any vents or units, so I assume it doesn't exist.  Sure, it can be considered a luxury, but not in an establishment where you are expected to spend any extended period of time.  \n\nThe service can be slow and if you don't know the drill there you can end up feeling like you don't belong.  One time, after ordering and waiting for my drink, I tried to pay at the far end of the bar instead of near the cash register because a new crowd had gathered and was blocking the register.  The girl told me huffily that \"We have a system here.  You need to pay over here.\"  Instead of her taking my money and walking the 2 feet, I had to \"excuse me/pardon me\" through the crowd to get there.  To her.  I felt embarrassed for being so stupid.  ( I was also  6 months pregnant and SITTING AT THE COUNTER!)  \n\nFinally, I understand they have a monopoly in the neighborhood, but the prices are very high.  See for yourself.   If you want any kind of specialty drink, you will have to start at around $3.95 for a small.  It doesn't matter if it has simple or complex ingredients or if they can make the batches in bulk and in advance.  (Today I had a Thai iced coffee, which I am pretty sure is just iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk added.)\n\nThe place just isn't good enough, comfortable enough, or pleasant enough to warrant the prices and service.", "date": "2009-07-18 00:11:12", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 15, "average_stars": 3.25, "yelping_since": "2009-01-23 01:46:39"}}

That being said, I will never spend another cent at Rocket Cat Cafe. The service has progressively gotten worse and worse in the last 3 years that I have lived in the neighborhood. Many of the barristas get more and more rude with almost every visit which alone I might be able to accept if it were not for the fact that it takes (literally, zero hyperbole) 10 minutes to receive any espresso drink. Yesterday I went in and ordered a latte. Paid for my drink ($5.05 plus a $1.00 gratuity.) I am used to waiting some time at Rocket Cat so I decided to use this time productively and walk across the street and go to the local deli to make a purchase. After waiting for the traffic light and crossing Frankford Ave. twice, going into the deli, having a short (small talk) conversation with the deli owner and making a purchase I returned to Rocket Cat. There was no one in line so I walked up to the counter and said \"excuse me I ordered a latte.\" Before I even finished my thought the barrista grunted \"Yah.\" while staring at me confrontationally. I tried to explain myself and said \"I just walked across the street..... Once again the staff member jumped down my throat and said \"She had other orders.\" I wanted to try and explain that I just was inquiring as to whether or not my order had been completed, but then the other barrista chimed in \"that's the way it works\" in a snotty childish voice. Then she STARTED to make my order. I decided to just shut up and go back outside and wait.\n\nWhoever owns this place please take note of all the negative reviews placed previously to my entry. I would say most of those previous entries are spot on and I wish I had heeded the advice contained in those reviews.

Seriously. \n\nOn the whole, their hot espresso drinks just aren't that good.  I once got a white chocolate mocha there that tasted like peanut butter.  This would have been kind of tasty if I wanted a peanut butter latte.  But I didn't.  The mochaccino was a bit muddy.  The regular iced coffee is totally adequate, but nothing special.  Iced mochas need sugar but are pretty yummy once that has been taken care of.  The Thai Iced coffee is truly where they shine.  It's so yummy, refreshing, totally addictive, and will get you amped for anything.  I've tried making it on my own and it's just not as good. \n\nI wouldn't recommend coming here if you're in a hurry.  Even when there's not a line, it seems like they move kind of slow.  The service is usually pretty friendly though.  While you're waiting, peep some of the pastries.  They sell some kind of chocolate brownie cookie looking round thing that is divine.\n\nThe thing I don't like about Rocket Cat is that the Thai iced coffe (wow, I am so crushing on this stuff) is not available in the winter, but summer is a-coming!

Negative reviews are important to write, but I miss having good things to say.  Luckily, I'm spending a little quiet time in Philadelphia this week, and I seem to have hit the jackpot with Rocket Cat Cafe.  Warm, generous, open, hip space.  Coffee and food are very good.  Free wireless and plug-in's but, as with Leotah's, not at all coldly laptopp-y in feel.  And like Leotah's, this place has a beautifully alternative feel that seems to be far too short in supply in Philadelphia.  Although Rocket Cat is a genuine cafe in the sense of it's being expected that many people will simply come here for coffee and writing/surfing, the owner (or proprietor?) seems to take a kind of quiet joy in customizing items as casual as a bagel-with-avocado, or a simple sandwich, to the appetite of the eater.  More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).  It was just a bagel with avocado!  But she made it great.  There's also a retro wrap-around counter area with stools, and the fact that these seats are pretty regularly used seems to be a testament to the warm, kind feel of this place.

I was at a table with my friend and I got up to get a refill on my Tea. When I came back to sit down, I put the tea on my table then sat in the chair, and it suddenly went backwards and stopped at an angle. I thought at first that I had broken my chair, and tried to get up when I realized I was stuck at an odd angle. As a bigger person, I was at first extremely embarrassed about the situation, though honestly i've NEVER broken a chair before in my life! When I looked down I saw that the leg of my chair had fallen into a HOLE in the floor. Not the side of the floor against the wall, the side of my chair in the middle of the floor! It took  another patron to help get me up. The other patron said to me that the same thing had happened to him recently. I got up and informed the two young ladies at the bar about what happened, and I got the brush off with them saying \"Oh no! We will look into that\" then turning away from me.  What would have happened if I had not put my tea down before? I could have been severely burnt! Right away I started having some back pain which has gotten worse since I left. I also now have a headache. I tried to find an e-mail address for the owner but I couldn't. I will be going to the doctor on monday to get my back checked out.\n\nI think the worst part of this embarrassing experience is that the people behind the bar didn't even do so much as to ask if I was ok? And I wasn't sitting in an out of the way table. That hole is dangerous. I also noticed one around the pipes on the other side of my table. I will continue to try and contact the owner of the shop. \n\nThis was not my first time at Rocket Cat, and before this I have enjoyed it. The food is good, the people are usually friendly, and their tea doesn't suck which is a rarity in this area. I won't be going back though, because of the attitude of the baristas.

Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \n\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it.
