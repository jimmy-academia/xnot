Guy comes back with a bowl of lettuce DRY with nothing on it.  So I'm like:  Is this dry lettuce???  He said well you said you didn't want anything on it.  No that isn't what I said.  I said no onions but ok now you people are just being insulting!  I said: I'll just take my bill and a box to go to the guy.  Waitress comes & says do you want a box to go?  I'm all: yes because this entire experience sucked completely.  Waitress:  \"Well ok then!\"  She comes back with box & I start to tell her what my problem is which was pretty much everything from start to not even finishing and she doesn't want to hear what my problem is or why it was such a bad experience...she just took the Benedict off my bill and walked away.  & no I didn't take my dry lettuce stuffed into a bowl & the 1 egg Benedict I left on the plate.

Firstly, our server never came to greet us, and when the hostess walked by, she noticed and sent her over. Once there, she informed us no one told her we were her table.  Next, we ordered the Acai Bowl, which is mostly banana whip.  I have worked in restaurants that served whip, have a whip machine at home, and had this dish there in the past so I know there was absolutely no banana in it. When the server asked us how it was, I politely told her there was no banana.  She said she would check with the kitchen and when she returned, told us there was indeed banana in it.  But then, a bus boy came to our table and told us the \"recipe changed\" (even though it is the same on the menu) after hearing our conversation. But finally, we overheard another server at the table right next to us tell that couple to be aware that the caf\u00e9 has been out of bananas and could not make smoothies, etc. Wow!  We could not believe we were lied to.  And we were still charged for it!\n\nIt just got worse.  We waited a long time for our food, and when it finally came out, it was not what we ordered.  We waited some time again, and a second round of dishes came out  - not our food. We could not believe it (neither could the table next to us).  When we finally got our food, over an hour later, it was cold as if it was just sitting in the kitchen.  Once again, nothing was taken off our bill and the waitress even said to us upon leaving \"lord, I feel like this caf\u00e9 wronged you both in every way today - I do hope you will give us another try sometime.\" Not even a manager came over to apologize...\n\nAnd to follow up, I emailed the restaurant directly about this bad experience before posting and have yet to hear anything back...", "date": "2016-04-27 01:59:58", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 25, "average_stars": 2.26, "yelping_since": "2012-07-05 21:50:31"}}

The variety of offerings from one venue with hours that practically make it a 24-hour operation should yield a review of much more praise...unfortunately it falls flat. There's a lot that Front Street Cafe can be and should be doing to really make this an all-star neighborhood contender. Here's the breakdown of woo's and boo's:\n\nCAFE: \nWoo!: I'll start here because I have great things to say about the coffee shop aspect of FSC. The house coffee is Counter Culture Hologram, a delicious cup for a very reasonable $1.75 a cup (though strangely I was charged $2.50 when ordering off of the brunch menu). The pastry case is stocked with local favorites such as Dottie's Donuts and Crust Vegan Bakery, so good that my carnivorous boyfriend was shocked when he ordered a donut only to later learn that it was vegan. The grab-and-go case has a variety of offerings including juices and pre-made salads/sandwiches, definitely a nice option to have when on the run.\nBoo!: The entire FSC space is kind of just a mish-mash of usable serviceable table space, upstairs, downstairs, cafe, patio, you can sit wherever. I come here often to do work, mostly on weeknights before I go home, and I can choose to sit wherever there is an open table to set up shop and grab a cup of coffee. On weekends, however, top priority is given to someone ordering a full meal. I understand the loss of money on a table that is only ordering coffee and looking to knock out an hour or two worth of work, but being turned away doesn't make the space feel much like a comfy neighborhood cafe anymore. On my most recent visit, I asked if there was anywhere that I could get a little bit of work done and I was told no because the cafe is used for brunch from 10:00-2:00...when I told the hostess that I had every intention of ordering a meal, I was immediately given a table. Many others were turned away from sitting and having a casual cup of coffee because the entire cafe side of the house was being used to seat brunch-goers. \n\nFOOD: \nWoo!: While I haven't had a full dinner here, I have ordered happy hour appetizers and have had brunch on more than one occasion. For happy hour, follow the recommendation of many other reviewers and order the buffalo cauliflower, it really is delicious. Other notables for me have been the oven fried potato and the pickled veggie platter, but I'm a sucker for anything soaked in vinegar. \nBoo!: When every other negative review says that their food was cold upon arrival, you would think FSC would take note. The first time I had brunch, I ordered a salad so I couldn't speak to food temperature; on my most recent visit however, I ordered the Gravlax platter (again opting for a cold dish)...how can you mess up a cold salmon platter? Easy. You send the dish out missing the avocado listed on the menu, you inconsistently slice the salmon, and you fry the capers in what tasted to be old oil. I'll generously offer a redeeming plus one for the everything english muffin, it's about as close to a bagel as you get on their menu....I'm still confused as to why a cafe doesn't have bagels that aren't gluten free. Lastly, I wouldn't normally comment on someone else's experience, but sitting next to me was a couple whose food came out so cold that one of the two told the server that it felt like his eggs benedict had been placed in the refrigerator prior to serving. Now that's pretty bad. \n\nTHE BAR: \nWoo!: It's a bar!\nBoo!: When Front Street Cafe first opened, they had a killer happy hour. Their specialty cocktails were half priced, and select beers and wine (3 beers, 1 white wine, 1 red wine) were all $5 plus a half priced juice of the day from the cafe. I told a group of friends all about it and so we decided on this as our Friday end-of-week wind down happy hour opting to sit outside on the gorgeous patio. Sitting here meant that we had table service, which would have been fine except that our waiter didn't write down any of our orders and ended up bringing us incorrect cocktails on both rounds before we called it quits and went elsewhere. Luckily we aren't too picky, we found someone at the table who would drink what was brought out, but between the inaccurate orders and the understaffed bar, happy hour consisted of two rounds over two hours because service was just so slow. Not long after FSC opened, that happy hour disappeared. While happy hour still exists, the options are much more limited in nature; while this may mean a more manageable list for the bar and waitstaff, it's a little disappointing for patrons who may not care for the single $5 cocktail on the menu.\n\nWith a few fixes I can see FSC really knocking it out of the park, but until that happens I'll be here during off-peak hours for coffee and taking happy hour/brunch to other businesses in the neighborhood.", "date": "2016-02-08 19:22:33", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 388, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2010-03-22 18:25:01"}}

I spent a long time working in the service industry (serving, bartending, management) That being said I understand that things can't always be perfect, but my experience kind of forced me to be \"that guy\" on yelp, I feel slightly robbed and Unsatisfied after this morning. \n\nI ordered the Veggie Hash with poached egg, Chicken Waffle bites, an order of fries with 3 of the house-made aioli (because I heard they were delicious). \n\nOur food came out and it was cold , happens. The chicken and waffle bites came out 5 minutes later so I'm assuming maybe the kitchen was off and the server was waiting for the entire order and our Platters were left out to dry. \n\nA new order was made which we appreciated, I feel we were extremely understanding and polite when we mentioned it was cold, we just wanted to get our money's worth and to experience quality since it's slightly heftier than your typical breakfast pricing..and at a diner usually things come out so hot you have to wait a minute. \n\nThe poached eggs, hash and fries were being remade as we picked at our chicken and waffle bites, that were slightly undercooked.... maybe not but we were unable to make it through a few because they were tough and hard to chew. ( wouldn't order again) \n\nThe food came back out but seemed like it was rushed in the cooking process ( hash should kinda have some crunch ) not the case. I would have rather waited longer a second time for the food to taste right than to have instant gratification. I'm a patient person ( this experience tested that for sure) and on top of it all it lacked flavor ... no fabrication, it was extremely undercooked and had no flavor.  The fries were forgotten about until 10 minutes before we asked for our check, with the 3 aioli just chilling there at 50cents a pop, which I totally wouldn't have minded if I actually had fries to dip into them. \n\nLike I said, I work in the industry. From the way it seemed, the server was spread thin and tried her best,may have not only been encountering issues with only our party. She seemed flustered, so I won't say she was being rude to us,  but she was unapologetic and barely present our entire visit ( another staff member encountered our frustration/blankly staring and silent looking confused) \n\nOur coffee was on the house at the end of the entire experience and our aioli was full price even though it took 1hr to get fries to go with ... I'm not broken hearted but I'm sad.\n\nMaybe this was way to long if a review but I know that this kind of stuff can be helpful and I didn't want to just cookie cut it. I will probably be back, but I don't want you guys to get a bad reputation so I hope this feedback is helpful. \n\nI swear I'm not an asshole, I'm just disappointed.", "date": "2018-09-19 18:15:15", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 9, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2017-05-15 22:58:14"}}

I asked for Medium, pink in the middle. I always say pink in the middle to the waitstaff, always. The burger was Rare in the middle, regardless, I ate it anyway. I'm not one to return ANYTHING to the kitchen - ever.\n\nOh yeah, before I finished ordering my hamburger, I told the waitress, or waiter, that I wanted 5 times more \"Tomato Jam\" than was deemed necessary - I like a lot of \"Tomato Jam\" on my burgers and fries. I ordered the \"Wedge Potatoes\" with my burger.\n\nWaitress or Waiter - yes, there were two of them, and that may have added to some level of confusion.\n\nNote to Front Street Cafe - One person is enough to attend to a table. If it requires Two, then they should at least be coordinated with each other. At times it seemed as if the Two waitstaff had no idea what the other one was doing.\n\nI got my burger and it had 1 tiny metal cup of Ketchup, not \"Tomato Jam\" with it. And that tiny metal cup was half full. There was however a very little smear of \"Tomato Jam\" underneath my \"Wedge Potatoes\" Once again I told the waitress that I'd like additional \"Tomato Jam\" or Ketchup for my meal.\n\nNONE EVER CAME.\n\nIt's not like it was a full to capacity evening at Front Street Cafe, so this shouldn't have been a difficult request to fulfill, at all.\n\nPlease don't be pretentious, don't go to all of the trouble to make and serve \"Tomato Jam\" people want Ketchup for their burgers and fries, Heinz Ketchup, or Hunt's Ketchup, but Ketchup. Even homemade Ketchup, as long as it's Ketchup, and not \"Tomato Jam.\" Also, I didn't think the \"Tomato Jam\" was all that tasty, it lacked salt.\n\nSome of us want LOTS OF KETCHUP.

Whatever you call them, \"Wedge Potatoes\" or French Fries, or if you're politically cute, and passe - Freedom Fries. They should never be thicker than my stubby little fingers - never.

A restaurant/cafe/bar/performance space seems like a recipe for disaster, but thoughtful attention to the customer experience down to small details make this place a winner. Some things I appreciated when my husband and I visited for brunch yesterday:\n\n* It can take a while to get seated, but there's a coffee bar right there where you can order yummy drinks and smoothies while you wait. There's also some seating, which in our case was taken up by families, but is a nice touch. \n\n* They have a new fancy water filtration system that they seem super proud of. We were informed up front that it would be an additional $1 per person for unlimited fancy filtered water and decided to go for it. The water was tasty, and I like that they are serving healthy options that don't trash the environment. \n\n* The main dining area is a big, open, high-ceilinged space with hardwood floors, brick walls, metal ceilings, and lots of iron. Spaces like this always look beautiful, except that they're usually so loud you can't hear yourself think. Front Street Cafe remedied this by lining the edges of the ceiling with unobtrusive sound-insulating panels that matched the corrugated metal ceiling, keeping the aesthetic but making it easy to have a conversation. The music was also the exact right volume. It's such a small thing, but it makes such a big difference. \n\n* The menu was incredibly vegan-friendly but still had options for die-hard carnivores (like my husband). A place where your vegan friends and your husband who will die without red meat can dine harmoniously? Yes, please. \n\n* The pancakes were delicious, and were heaped with sculptural levels of fresh fruit, almond cream, granola, and real maple syrup. I don't know what that other lady is going on about. Maybe next time she should just go to IHOP. \n\n* Nice beer list and drinks menu. We didn't partake (it was brunch, and we had to drive), but good to know for next time. \n\n* Every staff member we interacted with was lovely. Personable without being smarmy, accommodating without hovering. We shared some laughs. It was nice. \n\n* The bathrooms are spacious and have many stalls. Again, a small thing that makes a big difference!\n\nSo yeah, Front Street Cafe is #doingitright, and definitely a place I'll want to dine again the next time I'm in Philly.", "date": "2016-09-25 14:35:47", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 141, "average_stars": 3.58, "yelping_since": "2010-06-07 20:40:05"}}

Interior and massive outdoors patio is what dream eateries are made of.  Cool, clean, with a little industrial, a little farmhouse. There is so much room, you feel like you can breathe, stretch out and enjoy your meal, cocktails, what have you. And folks, that's where my compliments will end. The burger was pretty good, but dang, this place needs WORK. It's been a while since I've experienced such horrendous service like what's going on here.\n\nWhat absolutely ruined my experience the last time I was here, was a combined failure of front and back of house, and one where not one management person came to our table to apologize or explain, which is a big no-no in my book. Let me reiterate that prior to my current employment, I had been in the restaurant/service industry for a long time, so I'm familiar how problems like these typically get resolved.  \n\nSet scene.  Sunday brunch. Mid-day, relatively busy, but not oppressively so. Lots of vacant tables, restaurant seemed to be well-staffed. Party of five (that includes a three year old).\nOrders taken for drinks and food at the same time. Takes a good fifteen minutes to receive drink order.  Fine, it's brunch.  Food arrives perhaps another fifteen minutes later, but food runner brings me a wrong order, and the two sides we ordered for my daughter never materialize or the iced coffee that I had ordered at the outset.  \n\nTen minutes pass, our server absent-minded appears with no apology but says food is coming, I remind her of the missing sides (a bagel and some grits) along with my order: a vegetable sandwich. Easy peasy. I'm polite. Bagel and a veggie sandwich, kitchen should be able to slap that together rather fast? No. \n\n Another ten to fifteen minutes pass and nothing. Finally the bagel for my daughter appears, few minutes later, the iced coffee is dropped off. I urge everyone to eat while it's hot, and no one really steps forward to tell us the status of the outstanding food, or apologizes - it's just an afterthought. After everyone is done, the server re-appears again without showing interest or concern.  I inform her that I'd like to take my food to go since the meal is finished. Nearly twenty minutes after everyone's food arrives, my to go container with a VEGETABLE sandwich (not a burger well done) appears. Our bill arrives and she tells us she didn't charge us for the sides (well, the one bagel we ordered) nor the sandwich and that's it.  No apology, no manager, no one. Crickets.\n\nThe food in the end, is pretty much mediocre and on the whole cold.  The burger is the most delicious item I taste at the table (and I'd reorder that in a heartbeat, if I ever was to return), and their bloody mary's, are well, absymal.  The veggie sandwich I eat once we're home, it simply that: a sad little bun that contains peppers, onions, a portabella mushroom and a couple strands of arugula. I'm told there's some salsa verde in there, but I don't taste it. Their smoothies (though crazy price-y at 8 bucks a pop) are yummy.  We were seated at the large booths that sit right at the double doors that lead outside; which annoyingly enough felt the harsh reverberations of the doors smashing open and shut every 45 seconds when service kept going in and out.\n\nThe absolute lack in professional service and/or concern was the real kicker for me here. I mean, mistakes happen.  This restaurant hasn't been open forever, but it's been long enough, that these kinds of mistakes and inconsistencies should be resolved by now, and the fact that the manager (I'm assuming it was a woman that delivered the bagel and said it was 'on her' - and who never introduced herself or made a reappearance at our table - clearly avoiding us) was entirely absent really ruined the whole dining experience for both myself and my family who was dining here for the first time.  The server could have barely given a shit, either that, or she was a very good actress. A \"I'm sorry about the mistake or your order, or anything\" would have been nice. But nope.

I am not a vegan, but lactose intolerant and have a difficult time with bread (not gluten free, just can't do a lot of bread). Let me start by saying that I had a really difficult time picking only one thing...so I didn't! Here is what I got:\n\n1. Porridge: Oh....My.....Lord was this good. This bowl (gluten free and vegan btw) is so large and full of all of the good things your body needs. You have plant-based milk, coconut, nuts, fruits, and just general deliciousness. Not to mention that the portion is HUGE! I took like 60% of it home and had it for breakfast this morning (still good). \n\n2. Vegan Scrapple: I've had better but it wasn't the worst. Doesn't taste like scrapple, though. \n\n3. Mushroom Bacon: I'm telling you right now that I will have dirty dreams about this \"bacon\". As a meat eater, this bacon (while it doesn't taste 100% like bacon) is the work of a genius. How on earth did you get mushrooms to taste like that? If you don't get the bacon, you're a fool. Try it! A side is just $4! Even my mate, who got actual bacon, was surprised at how good it was. Do. It. \n\n4. My mate got the eggs benedict with bacon on an everything english muffin. The muffin was not your typical Thomas', but looked good. The bacon was exceptionally done, nice a crispy. However, the hollandaise looked a little TOO yellow for my fancy and...to the detriment of those like myself who love to watch a poached egg explode...the second one was cooked all the way through like a hard boiled egg. Oh well, it happens. Poaching is an art. \n\nFor drinks, I got a cortada which was good and my  mate got a coffee which was way too bitter for my taste. He also got a Mimosa that was way overpriced but \"it's okay, it's mainly champagne\" he assured me. I got a glass of wine to finish off my meal that was a-okay in my book. \n\nWill I be back?

The upstairs is significantly smaller than downstairs but it was very quiet and there were lots of people up there studying and working, so it seemed like the right place for us to be. I want to open my review by saying that I really love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Like many restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown, it definitely has a sort of weathered, industrial, antiquated feel to it, and I really love that aesthetic so I thought it was charming.\n\nOur server greeted us with coffee and was very attentive. The coffee was served in these delightfully large mugs that were perfect for wrapping your hands around on a freezing cold day. I'm not an expert coffee taster by any means, but I thought that the coffee was a little too bitter even after adding sugar and cream.\n\nWe ordered buffalo and sriracha cauliflower, which unfortunately was not served until just before our entrees came out. The cauliflower itself was awesome, I am certainly not a big eater of this particular vegetable but I thought that our appetizers were really great and I would order them again. Besides being really flavorful, the cauliflower also had a nice texture, as though it were baked or fried. \n\nFor my entree I ordered huevos rancheros. I was honestly a little bit disappointed, I thought it was a little bit small considering it was $14. It was served on a large plate and had a significant amount of fresh greens on top so it looked like a salad at first glance. Underneath the greens were the black beans, eggs, tortilla, quinoa, and other fixings. I didn't feel like the greens added anything amazing to the flavor of the meal. The entree itself was good, but felt light and didn't leave me feeling satisfied. If I go back I think I will order something different. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the restaurant and I would definitely like to eat here again.\n\nMy final breakdown: \nService: 5 out of 5\nAtmosphere: 5 out of 5\nFood: 3.5 out of 5\nParking: free, if you can find it", "date": "2018-01-03 23:20:11", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 70, "average_stars": 4.32, "yelping_since": "2014-08-09 23:50:49"}}

Immediately, we loved the ambiance of the place - so clean/modern, but cozy and inviting at the same time. Unfortunately, there wasn't much else that impressed us about Front Street Cafe.\n\nFirst, they don't have a dedicated happy hour menu, although they do offer specials. There was no mention of happy hour anywhere, and our waitress never brought it up - we only knew from having visited the Facebook page prior to our visit. Even after we specifically asked about it, it took a while for us to figure out what the offerings were. One of us opted for the cucumber gimlet, and two of us got the only red wine that was included in happy hour - the Cotes du Rhone.\n\nThe good: the cucumber gimlet was delicious. The very bad: our red wine tasted straight-up rotten. This wasn't just a bitter or poorly-made wine - I've had the displeasure of accidentally ingesting rotten grapes (or rotten food in general), and the three of us all agreed that that was pretty much what this wine tasted like.\n\nI brought up the matter to our waitress (note that I'm generally not picky at all about food, and never fuss unless there's an actual problem). She insisted that they got this complaint \"all the time\" and that it was just the way that the wine was - \"earthy\" and \"vinegary.\" She didn't offer to taste it herself or get a second opinion, but immediately dismissed our complaint. Thankfully, she was able to take the wine off the tab, so we just left it at that.\n\nThe dinner entrees were better. My friend was satisfied with her veggie burger (quinoa + mushroom) and I enjoyed my fried chicken sandwich, although our party seemed to agree that the banh mi was rather mediocre. The oven fried potato that is offered with the sandwiches may have been my favorite part of the meal - it's a wonderful cross between a baked potato and potato chips/fries.\n\nI wasn't sure what to make of the service. It was a little on the slow side, although we weren't there during a particularly busy time. Our waitress answered all of our questions and was reasonably nice, but I'm still bothered by her response to our wine.\n\nOverall, I'd give the food 3.5* and service 2.5*. (I've decided to give FSC the benefit of the doubt and not take the potentially rotten wine into consideration.) Decent, but it's not good enough to make the trek from Center City/West Philly worth it.", "date": "2015-11-18 04:08:05", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 33, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2015-04-12 22:17:22"}}

I've been clamoring to try it and was so excited that we finally had a Saturday available for brunch. \n\nFirst, it's gorgeous. They took their time with this place and it shows. I'd go back just for the building. I definitely want to sit in the garden and have coffee drinks, and cocktails, and dinner. But for now the main vibe I got from the place was coldness. It was a recurring theme.\n\nOur server was disinterested and barely spoke with us except to take our order. She checked on us once the whole time. I got a hot tea and never received any sweetener and had to ask for lemon with it (from the women who delivered it). Odd. In general it seemed like we were bothering her. We sat upstairs with I think one or two other tables. Our food was also cold or room temperature. Huh? It felt like a lot of the components were premade and then assembled by the kitchen staff. My husband ordered the vegan biscuits and gravy with real poached eggs and a side of mushroom bacon. I had the tofu scramble benedict with vegan scrapple.  My dish was room temperature. The food tasted really good (save for the baked products that were dense and need some serious work). I loved my tofu scramble, hollandaise, and and vegan scrapple. The flavors were great, but served hot with a lighter muffin would've been perfection. His dish was tasty, but again the only egg was hot and it seemed the rest of the dish was reheated. The mushroom gravy was a little scarce, but delicious. The biscuit was better than my english muffin, but still pretty dense. Even the mushroom bacon was cold, and needed a little salt. It's like the smoked coconut bacon from Memphis Taproom but a little sweeter and the texture is chewier. We left full, but I think that was only because of the dense baked goods. \n\nBecause they are so vegan and vegetarian friendly, I will definitely go back. I appreciate a business that takes the time to create an interesting and flavorful menu, but something about it seemed rush. I feel like with refinement (and a nicer server) this place could easily be five stars. Yes, it's kind of crazy expensive, including the draft list. Really? No. Not in Fishtown where you can go to so many different craft beer bars and get drafts $2-3 cheaper.

Really comforting, especially when coming in from the cold outside. As soon as you step in, you're greeted by a large lobby and bar that serves tea, coffee, and smoothies. We got teas while we waited which were fitting for the cold weather (green jade blossom).\n\nWhen being seated, the area is quite small but packed. There's a homey feel to it as everyone is happy and talking away with their friends/family.\n\nWe ordered the turkey burger and all natural burger since we craved lunch food instead of breakfast food. \n\nYou'd think that the burgers are just burgers but honestly, they were one of the best burgers I've had.\n\nThe turkey burger tasted nothing like turkey since it was so moist. I'd say it was more of a turkey patty with the texture of a breakfast sausage. Nice and spongy but without the grease! With the avocado and plentiful fries, it made a nice pairing that left you full but not sluggish (you know, the feeling after having a greasy meal).\n\nThe all natural burger was the no frills all american burger that came with bacon. I ordered it in a medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. This resulted in a nice and juicy patty that sent me to heaven whenever I took a bite. Beware though, it was extremely messy and I found my hands covered in grease/juice that made me wish I picked something else (but that's just me!). Regardless, it was an amazing burger and I'd go back just to order 2 or 3 more. \n\nI mentioned the fries briefly but I didn't mention they tied up the meal. Some fries are sad and soggy. Some are crunchy and stiff. These fries were right in the middle. This led to a nice soft interior but extremely crunchy exterior that created a party in your mouth whenever you had them after a bite of your burger.\n\nObviously, we could have gotten something different but it was 2pm by the time we got there and we were so hungry that we picked basically anything that we immediately saw.", "date": "2018-11-13 04:04:37", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 17, "average_stars": 4.47, "yelping_since": "2012-08-11 03:11:03"}}

Actually, it's my least favorite dining experience of all time!!! My car got towed (illegally come to find out) on Front Street, in front of Kung Fu Necktie across the street. Be VERY careful parking around here as the area is known for vicious tow truck companies just running away with your car! Well, one company really. A truly traumatic experience. I mean, awful!! AWFUL!! Threatened with pit-bulls, dead bolted in a room full of men in an scary neighborhood, scammed out of my money, lied to....Horrific!!! See my review for Siani's Salvage. You were warned!! I don't want to fog what will be a shining review with this negativity so I'll just leave it at that. It's truly a shame this experience has made me hesitant to return as the food and vibes were just my style....\n\nLet's start with the ambiance which is truly great. Reclaimed wood, exposed brick, clean, bright and light, industrial chic. There's also a roof deck and courtyard which look phenomenal and I place I wood like to be in warmer weather. The flowers on the table were simple but had a little sparkle. Love that! \n\nWe entered and moved past all of the people grabbing their morning coffees and nosh to the hostess stand. It seems like this place is a morning rush go-to for those who live nearby. I can certainly see why. I happened to catch a glimpse of the bakery case which looks filled with  delicious goods and did notice the variety of milks...soy, almond...oh yea, I'm in the right place. Excited! \n\nWe waited about 8 minutes on a holiday Monday morning until we were seated, but not before we were asked if we had reservations (even though there were plenty of empty tables) so I'm assuming they are usually needed for brunch (?). \n\nWe were escorted to the back room by the beautiful bar and the hostess handed my daughter crayons and a nice big coloring sheet so yea, go ahead and bring those kiddos! \n\nWe started with the Matcha Mint Chip smoothie \n(cacao, mint, matcha, almond maple, banana, vanilla) which I thought was really great! Not too thick and full of\nMinty flavor! I would definitely get it again. $8 is fairly standard for this type of drink. \n\nOur table of 4 split: \n\nThe Acai Bowl- (acai banana whip, coconut, fresh seasonal fruits, nuts and seeds granola $10.) Very good.  A tad too \"soupy\" for me personally, but the table liked it a lot and it was tasty!\n\nThose iconic Lean Green Hotcakes- (fresh seasonal fruits, vanilla cashew cream, maple syrup $12.) They told me the color is created by using kale juice! How clever!! They were good. The toppings were better than the actual cakes. Needed the syrup, a tad on the dry side. Would maybe give it another go. \n\nThe tofu tacos: (tofu scramble, kale, avocado, smoked mushrooms, ``whiz``, pickled red onions, micro cilantro, corn tortillas, smoked black beans $12) DELISH!! Love the pickled red onions. Perfectly sized portion! Loved these!! A great brunch item!\n\nThe chili: (hearty lentil chili, gluten-free cornbread muffin $7.) Very tasty, filling and just the right amount of spice. Perfect for a cool day. \n\nKale Caesar: (kale, walnut picada, roasted tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumber, roasted tomato vinaigrette $10) My favorite dish of the day!! Again with those pickled red onions!! Yum! Perfect blackened tofu. Perfect dressing to kale ratio. Perfect!! Get one for the table to share!\n\nPrices were very fair for the quality and portion sizes. \n\nI was very impressed by the creative, eclectic menu!! You do not have to be vegan to enjoy a meal here (they have a few options for you carnivores), but boy if you are....it's paradise!! Go for it! I wanted to sample everything and really wish to come back and do so as it all looks incredible. So many amazing options!! I have to get over the trauma of my towing experience because this place is really a treat!

Very roomy and the outdoor garden is very beautiful on this 70 degree day for brunch. \n\nService: (3.5/5) I went today (4/21/2019) for Sunday Brunch with a party of 5, my GF's cousin put her name down with the hostesses (there were two of them, a male and female) and we waited. As 20 minutes went by, she went back to check and the hostess got a little hasty and just tossed the mini-clipboard menus down as if we were in the wrong when she sat us down at our table. Our waitress was friendly and is very polite! (I wish I remembered her name!) she made the experience better with her service throughout our stay. The drinks and food came out in a timely manner. \n\nFood: (2.5/3/5) I am NOT an expert at food rating nor am I foodie by any stretch of the means, but as I got a taste of the dishes my friends ordered, the food is pretty bland and need a little bit of seasoning. *Again, I am not an expert on judging food and this is my FIRST time here but have been to other cafes where I can respectfully compare to Front Street's Food.* Three of my friends ordered Egg's Benedict, w/a side of potatoes and the bread seemed kind of over-toasted a little bit but the rest of the components were okay. The potatoes were a bit bland. As for myself, I had the Quinoa Bean Bowl Salad (w/no add-ons) and it was pretty good as the salad that topped the tortilla was excellent and well dressed and the Quinoa bean salad's texture is thick enough to use as dip. \n\nDrinks: Acai Smoothie-Great, Iced Wild Berry Hibiscus Tea-Great, Peach Blossom Tea-Great, Iced Coffee-Bad, Cortado-Good. The iced coffee was a bit water down (mind you that my friend took a sip of the coffee before the ice melted). \n\nAt the end of the experience, we did not come out too satisfied with our food as the hostess kind of put a sour beginning to our experience and the food came out pretty bland. I understand that it is Easter Sunday, it is busy but a little more effort into the food could be improved a little bit. I am not going to be harsh in saying I will never revisit, but I think Cafe Lift has this place beat by a little. I mean that in a respectful manner, since I have repeatedly went back to Cafe Lift and their food has been exceptional and consistent. Even my very first visit to there tasted like my recent visit.

I'm vegan and brought my friend who is extremely allergic to dairy to try French Onion Soup for the first time in her life and she was so excited. She almost immediately started having a reaction so we asked our server if it was made with real cheese by mistake. Next thing we knew the manager came over with a prepared monologue about how much they respect the vegan diet and how they would never intentionally cause someone to break their moral stance on not eating animals. It was at this point we had to ask \"so what you're saying is that this is in fact real cheese?\" Which she only then actually confirmed. When I informed the manager that my friend in fact was having a severe allergic reaction she shut down and all she did was ask if there was anything else she could do. We asked for Benadryl which they didn't have so we asked for directions to the closes gas station as a member of our party ran to the gas station. Meanwhile, the server game over and bragged that she definitely put in vegan and fully blamed the cook rather than acknowledging that she had any part in the matter. She didn't ask how my friend was or check to make sure she was ok (no one did). All she did was comp her $7 soup from our $100 ticket as if that absolved her of any wrongdoing. She then ignored us for 20 minutes after we'd put our card down. Our friend made it to the gas station and back before she even came back for our card which she then took ages to return. No one apologized at any point for any part of this as my friend say there in immense pain.

Would've have gotten a perfect 10/10 if not for just two small things: the fries being too salty and the cook forgetting to remove the pickles. Still 8/10 is pretty solid! My sandwich was juicy, fulfilling, and surprisingly delicious given that it was not a the typical big deep fried super breaded chicken breast style. Adding the avocado did cost a bit much ($3.50 extra) but it was worth it, that touch of avocado was *chefs kiss*. The fries were made almost too perfection but they were a bit too generous with the salt.\n\nMy cousin got the Griddled Cheese with a side of Fries and she was very much satisfied with zero complaints.
