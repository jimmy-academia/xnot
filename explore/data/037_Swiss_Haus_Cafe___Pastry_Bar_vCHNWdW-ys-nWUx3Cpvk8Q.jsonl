Which was definitely nice because it was my daughter's birthday weekend and the place I normally purchased her cakes from were no longer in business. Well we went in and at first nothing caught our eye but then we saw just one square of strawberry shortcake and decided to share it. This cake was so good..the handmade whipped cream the fresh stawberries nice moist shortcake...so good..yum.,So I asked Miss daughter O mine how about this for a birthday cake and she emphatically said yes. Mind you she is super particular and funny about food so I was excited that she was excited about the cake. So I put in an order for the next day...paid $36 bucks and left. Fast forward to the next day...we picked it up...got it home and imagine our surprise when we saw that the entire cake had chocolate shavings or whatever all around the sides I mean a substantial amount of these chocolate curls.Huh?? No  one mentioned chocolate curls..shavings nothing..no one said Miss when you order a strawberry shortcake its totally different than what we make for individual servings in the bakery. The lady who originally sold us the slice asked if we ever had their strawberry shortcake before and we said no..she then said oh you both are going to love it. Hence, why wouldn't anyone mention these chocolate curls on ordered cakes..people do have allergies or some people just don't like chocolate shavings on a cake!!  Especially when you ate it for the first time it didn't have shavings all over it!!!The cake seemed dry too..it wasnt the same. So I'll just stick to the slices from now on. I'd rather spend $6.50 on a slice that Ill eat than $36 on a dry ass chocolate shaved cake that went in the garbage! SMDH!! Total waste....Oh and yes I did call ...no sorry no apologies no discount ....  just you can order it next time without shavings...and people love the shavings Grrrrr.... How would you know to order without shavings if you're not told it comes on the efffn cake????!!!!!!! And I'm not all people by any means and that especially holds true for my daughter too!!

I grew up in a family of bakers and I bake a lot, so my standards are pretty high. I find that a lot of bakeries overbake nearly everything, and that problem is compounded by the fact that most places let their baked goods sit for way too long before discarding or discounting them. Although I can't speak for how long things stay on the shelves at Swiss Haus, I can say that they do a good job of baking things properly. Their traditionally dry cookies and pastries are a bit on the dry side (though not in a bad way), and the things that should be moist (like brownies or cupcakes) are moist. This alone puts them ahead of 90% of the bakeries I've been to.\n\nI also really liked that Swiss Haus has a good variety of baked goods. My personal favorite is the devil's food cupcake, and there are a lot of great cakes, cookies, and brownies. I took some stuff home to my parents in Illinois on a recent visit, and my dad went nuts over the chocolate peanut butter brownie. This would be the moist stuff, and nearly everything I've sampled has been pretty good.\n\nOn the dry end of the spectrum (and oddly enough, the baked goods almost seem to be arranged in order of moistness to dryness, from left to right), there are a number of cookies and pastries to choose from. If you don't like dry cookies, you probably won't like most of what this place has to offer. The only cookie I've eaten here that was moist was the black and white cookie, and it was pretty delicious - especially the white side. The rest are harder, like the kind of cookies someone might eat with their tea or coffee. You can get them individually, or by the pound. I'm guessing the larger cookies might be a bit softer, but I've yet to sample them all.\n\nIf you're looking for traditionally Jewish/Eastern European baked goods, you'll find a reasonable selection here. I'm not sure if it varies by when you come in, but I've seen a variety of apple pastries, hamantaschen, and rugelach in their cases. If you're vegan or gluten-free, you'll find a FEW options, but not a ton. It's a bakery, what do you expect? I'm also not sure what their procedures are in terms of avoiding cross-contamination for gluten-free items, so if you have a serious medical need to avoid gluten, you might want to call ahead. \n\nThe only things I don't like about this place are the fact that there aren't more \"fancy\" cookies, especially very moist and soft ones, along with the fact that the staff is very hit or miss in terms of friendliness. Most of my experiences have been great, but there were a couple times I felt like they seriously wanted to shove all the customers out the front door. It's not that they did anything specifically unfriendly, they just seemed rushed and impatient as people were telling them what they wanted from the cases.", "date": "2014-09-16 15:43:56", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 230, "average_stars": 3.73, "yelping_since": "2009-11-11 01:56:52"}}

I absolutely love their pecan diamonds (basically pecan pie bars), raspberry walnut croissants, almond cream croissants, apricot/raspberry twists, and their cookies. They tend to be a little pricey, but it's quality comfort dessert food, so it's worth it. The ladies working behind the counter, owner Jim, and head chef Donna are always nice.\n\nI recently tried their vanilla cronut. I had always been hesitant on getting it because it's $5 and for $4 I could get one of their other wonderful desserts, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I had had one other cronut from the now defunct Crumbs bake shop in Rittenhouse Square. I can see why that shop closed. Their cronut was hard and terrible. I don't like kicking something when it's down, but it was such a crappy cronut and I discovered that the place was closed a week later that I didn't bother writing a scathing review for it. To think that Crumbs started in my hometown, too! Blasphemy. Anyways, Swiss Haus' cronut was the complete opposite. The layers were flaky and soft and the outer part crisped perfection. I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers. The entire $5 experience of a Swiss Haus cronut was basically lunch for me. It's a very filling pastry! Try it, try it, try it. You must.

I'm a total sugar and chocolate addict and always looking for a great bakery, something other than the thousand Italian bakeries that seem to abound in the Philly area. \n\nI bought 4 items on my first trip (and all within the limits of my $10 Groupon!)  I got a specialty pastry called a \"marjolaine,\"  a chocolate/chocolate cupcake, a hazelnut cake slice, and a complimentary double chocolate brownie-cookie drop with vanilla glaze (because I actually came a little under the $10 and they wanted to make up for it.)  Very friendly service from the one woman I dealt with on a Thursday afternoon.\n\nI ate the cookie first. Very \"meh.\" It was dry except for the embedded chocolate chips. You can make much better at home using the Baker's Chocolate Drops recipe found on the back of their unsweetened baking chocolate, very easy to do, just add a generic confectioners glaze.\n\nNext I tried their specialty marjolaine, priced at $4.99, so I expected it to be good. This is a four layer hazelnut meringue filled with hazelnut and chocolate cream, a bit of jam, and covered with a chocolate glaze. Again, I was underwhelmed and had a hard time pinpointing why. Ultimately, I found it to be too rich and too sweet (half a slice made me sick to my stomach) but without a whole lot of actual flavor. The chocolate glaze quality was pretty good though. \n\nNext I tried the cupcake. And I found myself asking, what do the following have in common:\n1. Sahara\n2. Mohave\n3. Death Valley\n4. This cupcake\n\nYou guessed it - dry dry dry! And the frosting was airy nothingness. I threw part of it away. Why do people bother to make cupcakes that aren't moist yumminess? If you want cupcakes, go to Brown Betty. End of story.\n\nFinally, the hazelnut cake square. Again, a lot of airy sweet nothingness, very unsatisfying. (In fact, the bakery box, when it held just the cupcake and cake square, weighed almost nothing. The marjolaine was the only hefty pastry.)\n\nThis place reminds me of many of the local Italian bakeries, because their cakes tend to be a lot of airy sweetness as well.

While searching for a good place to order a graduation cake, somebody recommended Swiss Haus Bakery.

It's all too tempting to take bite after bite...after bite. (And before I knew it, a quarter of a 10-inch cake was gone!) The mocha cake in particular had a great potent coffee flavor, and the crushed cashews on the side provided excellent contrast in texture. \n\nAfter sampling the Swiss Haus Bakery cake (and another French bakery's cake), I chose Swiss Haus. It was totally the right decision - even after a massive multi-course graduation dinner, our guests still devoured the cake with glee. Almost everyone asked us where we had ordered the cake from. \n\nOrdering and pick-up were very easy. We called after placing the order to make a last-minute change to the decorations, and they were able to accommodate us, no problem.

The exterior is very stereotypically Old World, what I would expect to find in a (touristy) mountainous town in Europe. But it took me about...3 years?...to finally walk into this traditional bakery, that has been in CC longer that I first realized.\n\nOne reason I never walked in was because you can't see inside - and it makes a big difference to the average passerby to see what they may be walking into. The interior is incredibly nondescript and in stark contrast to the bright red exterior with its white trimming. It's also quite large, and if I recall correctly there are a few seats available for customers. The counter spans two sides, one length filled with their cookies and another countertop holding their mini pastries, cakes and cupcakes. I had perused the Yelp reviews at one point and had heard mixed things about their signature dessert cake, so instead of getting that I decided to go basic because if a bakery can't do simple, classic baked goods then there's a problem with everything else. I picked up a chocolate cupcake and several different cookies to share with my fiance after dinner that night.\n\nI tried the chocolate cupcake first because I am the cupcake queen (according to fam and friends), and was instantly disappointed. The cupcake in general was kinda meh, a very light chocolate flavor to both cake and frosting, and the cake itself was not moist and very airy, like munching on foam. Next up came the cookies, which my fiance always has a strong opinion on:\n\nPeanut butter cookie had a dry, sandy cookie texture of the traditional PB cookie type, but it barely tasted of peanut butter!\n\nChocolate chip cookie was very average, in general it was like what you can get from chain supermarkets like genuardis with a crisp, sandy-ish crunchy texture, but the cookie dough base is a total waste with no flavor (do they not use brown sugar?)\n\nChocolate dipped pecan cookie is delicious - they're good at making that sandy texture kind of cookie, and the pecan flavor is pronounced\n\nHazelnut chocolate sandwich cookie was also delish, very nutty, crunchy with a good amount of chocolate ganache at the center\n\nVanilla butter cookie with a white chocolate center and the chocolate butter cookie with a semisweet chocolate center were both tasty versions of the classic recipe\n\nFor most of the traditional cookies, Swiss Haus seems like a pretty good place to pick up a large assortment for parties and get togethers, but when it comes to their other baked goods...well, there sure are a lot of bakeries around CC where you can get your cake-fix.", "date": "2013-05-28 10:35:46", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 742, "average_stars": 3.79, "yelping_since": "2007-08-25 02:36:44"}}

I was searching on Ritual and found that they partner with them (so I could order online). I originally ordered a hot chocolate with 2% milk, a chocolate muffin, and a chocolate chip brownie. About two minutes into my order, I noticed on my computer screen that it stated my order was cancelled, because there was no 2% milk. I decided I would just go to the store and change the milk (perhaps do swim or almond milk). When I arrived at the store, the employee was SUPER nice (this is the reason why I gave this visit three stars and not two). He told me that they cancelled the order because they did not have two out of the three products that I wanted, and that there was no way to contact me. (Does Ritual not provide the contact number of the customer in the event something is out of stock??) I asked if I could have the hot chocolate with skim milk and the employee said that the only kind of milk they had was whole milk (which was fine, I still requested him to make it for me). As for food, I just stuck with getting a brownie (on the website, they listed multiple types of brownies, and I originally wanted the \"chocolate chip brownie\" but I got a regular brownie with chocolate icing on top and sprinkles). The employee told me to put it through on Ritual again (since the first order never went through). I did not have the app on my phone, and had to do it through the phone internet browser (which thankfully loaded up quickly). Once I refreshed the page, I saw that they did update it with saying there was no 2% milk left in stock. Now let's talk about the taste of these products. Since the hot chocolate was made with whole milk instead of 2% or skim milk, I was expecting it to have a more richer/thicker taste. Instead, my hot chocolate was barely warm (almost room temperature??) and only had a small hint of chocolate. It tasted like I was drinking watery milk. I can't imagine if I had the skim milk what my hot chocolate would have tasted like if I had less thickness. As for the brownie, I wasn't a huge fan of it.

I cannot tell you the exact cost etc...So I emailed the cake I wanted to order and the reply I got on that was that ya come over anytime to the shop and you can place the order. I had to visit twice to the bakery which was not necessary only if that LADY STAFF would have given me quotes that time itself as I knew what flavor and customization I was looking for.\n\nSecond I did not know the difference between printed vs drawing customization, I was told it is not much difference and since drawing had additional $10(apart from $20 already paying), I decided to go with printed. I was shown a few pictures there by another GUY STAFF and the printed cakes did look very nice and close to hand drawn. I was convinced and I ordered for it to this Another STAFF. However when I went to collect the cake and saw it, I was disappointed as it looked like someone just printed the logos and stuck it on the cake. I ordered this customized (Broncos, Sriracha logo Cafe Mocha) cake. Also, I had asked for big Broncos logo to be in center and sriracha on up left corner. Both the logos were on the top and a big happy bday in center. While I expressed my disappointment to the LADY STAFF(I believe it was same lady I mentioned earlier), her immediate reaction was 'I did not take your order.' Woah..I am just expressing my disappointment, I paid $20 extra for customization and this just looked like a print page copy pasted. Also, doesn't matter who took the order, isn't it the staff responsibility for the entire cake shop or is it 1-on-1. I was very polite and I never asked for a refund or anything I just said 'I know nothing can be changed but I am disappointed with the looks of cake and also the logos were not as I asked for. She said that this is the biggest logo can get on such a cake.' Well I wasn't told about it when I placed the order. You need to tell me that when I was placing the order and not after I recieved it. She was rude and I just did not like her attitude..not at all a TEAM PLAYER. I don't know her name but I would say the reason I would not like to go here again is only because this LADY STAFF.

Here's what happened:\n\nI had a birthday party on Sunday, and their website said they need 48 hours to make a cake, so I went online Friday to get the phone number and noticed that they offer online ordering.  So I clicked through to EAT24, and ordered a cake.  Hours later I had a voicemail from EAT24 telling me to call them back or reply to the text message they were going to send me.  So I waited for a text, and it never came.\n\nThe next day (Saturday) I received another phone call (at 7AM) telling me that they canceled my order.  Um, what?  So I called the bakery and said I need to order a cake, and a very curt bordering on rude woman told me that they needed 48 hours to make a cake and, sorry.  So, I wound up scrambling to find a place to make me a cake, since Swiss Haus can't seem to handle the online ordering that they prominently feature on their website.

Yet I have not spotted any product here that comes even close to what pastries are like in Switzerland. I wonder if the people who run this place have ever tasted a Swiss pastry - or if they have - whether they even had the aptitude to perceive its distinctive qualities. \n\nWhile I've had a bite of a decent (albeit super dry) layered cake from this bakery, pastry arts are a pretty big deal in Switzerland, and I find it misleading to consumers to have \"Swiss\" in the name of a bakery whose offerings are as \"un-Swiss\" in every way as can possibly be. \n\nThat being said, the misleading name could be ignored if this bakery had some strong redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I find it hard to think of any. The common theme among many reviewers is that the cakes tend to be dry - which means they either aren't made properly, or they've been sitting on the shelves for too long. \n\nThe quality falls far short of that of even the most mediocre amateur patisseries in Europe (and perhaps even Philly) in terms of appearance, taste, and ingredient quality. These people make beginner-level pastry students at the Restaurant school look like master pastry chefs, by offering lopsided unimpressive looking cakes that lack any artistic sophistication in taste, texture, and overall composition. \n\nThe cro-creme is interesting, so I'll give a star for offering something that you might not easily find anywhere else in Philly. However, that star is immediately taken away by the fact that this item drips in grease and is exceptionally dry despite its cream filling and greasiness. (FYI - for much tastier versions, go to NYC.) \n\nAnother redeemable area could be service, but this establishment again falls short of reasonable expectations. I came here on a slow morning to order a croissant before heading into my office. There were 2 workers and one lady in line, who was placing an order for multiple pastries. \n\nAfter waiting patiently for 5 minutes while the 2 workers made no acknowledgment of my presence, I gently asked one of the girls to help me get a croissant. I was in a bit of a hurry and only needed one item. \n\nAs someone who once worked in places (from busy pizza shops to high volume fine dining) where I easily took care of 5 customers simultaneously while offering eager and cheerful service to everybody, I did not see any reason for the worker at this counter to give me a dirty look and throw me a dried up croissant without saying anything. I've experienced much better service from Wendy's. (Granted, I've been to Wendy's only once in the last 4 years, so I am open to the possibility that Wendy's level of service is either better or the same.)\n\nThe high pricing is definitely not justified, given the quality. When I think of this place, I think of pretentiousness and blatant disrespect for the beautiful art of pastry-making, particularly Swiss pastry-making. If this place was called \"The Mediocre Not-at-All-Swiss Haus Bakery,\" I might add a few stars for honest self-reflection.", "date": "2015-01-05 04:48:59", "useful": 8, "funny": 6, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 541, "average_stars": 3.96, "yelping_since": "2011-07-07 20:10:35"}}

While his choice of words in asking me to do so is questionable (which might explain why he did not post it publicly), he did productively clarify that the name of the bakery was not entirely up to him, and that the name was registered by the original owners of the bakery, who were actually from Switzerland. \n\nIt then follows, from my own reasoning, that perhaps the preservation of this name acts more as a preservation of a local brand, rather than a description of the products sold at this bakery. For this reason, I will add a star and I will give them the benefit of the doubt: that perhaps they are not using this name to advertise a level of quality that is actually greater than the quality of the products they sell.  \n\nHowever, I think it's important for Yelp reviews to provide users with a window into an experience to help them make informed purchasing decisions. Even business owners are consumers, at times, whether outside or within the scope of their business operations. And I am sure they would also prefer to see a useful collection of feedback about a business before making transactions, rather than spend their money blindly. In my case, I made fair payments for products that were not worth the price I paid. The service was terrible, but there is a way to address that, if they are interested in progress.\n\nThe owner wondered why I returned to his store if I initially had a bad experience. It did not occur to him that perhaps I wanted to find out whether that was an isolated incident or a pattern, and that if it was an isolated incident, then I would gladly return to show my support for a small business. This is not hard for me to clarify: \n\nI initially tasted a very dry custom-made layered cake from here at a birthday party. Instead of completely dismissing this bakery after the first bite, I just made a note of this in my mind. At some later point, I came in to try a cro-creme out of curiosity and convenience, as this bakery is conveniently located on the block across the street from my office building. I cannot lie about the fact that I regretted spending $5 on a pastry that was very dry and greasy. Again, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back for a croissant, which again, was the driest croissant I've ever tasted in Philly. (There was another time I came in because I was hungry and this was one of the closest places for food, and I was also given a very dry almond croissant.) Given that dryness is a consistent quality of these baked products in my experiences as well as that of other reviewers, I really don't see how unfair it is to say so. \n\nThe owner also wondered why I mentioned the Restaurant school and speculated that I might be affiliated with them or that might have written a \"petty and misplaced attempt at revenge.\" I am not sure how he came to this accusation, or why he thought that addressing a customer in this manner would be better than owning up to and addressing certain areas of improvement in the quality of his establishment. \n\nHowever, to clarify the above reference, my only \"affiliation\" with the Restaurant School is that I stop by their bakery sometimes to purchase pastries and coffee, and their pastries (made by students, to my surprise) are always delicious. In my prior review, I was simply expressing my surprise at how pastries made by beginner-level pastry students have been consistently tastier than ones made by a long-established bakery. There is no conspiracy going on here.

The competition included butter cookies from Rilling's, Feasterville Family Bakery, Leonardo's, and Desserts by Design.   Chosen as for the test was the flower-shaped butter cookie with the chocolate center, which all of the bakeries offer.     \n\nFirst place honors went to Rillings for its cookie's relatively soft crumb and clear butter flavor.   Our quibble was that the center dollop of chocolate was a bit sweet and hard, but overall it was a good cookie.   The other first place winner was Feasterville, whose cookie is very delicate and nearly disintegrates on the tongue (like any great shortbread).  One has to carefully transport Feasterville's cookies because they easily crumble in transit.  Again, the chocolate center was a bit sweet and hard.   Both Rilling's and Feasterville could elevate these cookies to epic status by replacing the chocolate frosting with a bittersweet ganache.\n\nSecond place went to Swiss Haus Bakery, whose butter cookies are a perennial household favorite.   The Swiss Haus version is much firmer than either than Rilling's or Feasterville's and it is less sweet.  To its credit, the Swiss Haus cookie's chocolate center is neither as sweet nor as hard as the first place bakeries' versions.  Swiss Haus's cookies are sufficiently hearty to transport with little breakage.    \n\nDesserts by Design had a credible entry, which earned them third place.   The cookie had a delicate crumb but lacked any butter flavor.   Where these cookies failed was an unattractive milk-chocolate-looking center that was not a consistent color throughout and was irregularly shaped.   It also was far too sweet and hard.\n\nMuch to our chagrin, Leonardo's version ended up in fourth place.
