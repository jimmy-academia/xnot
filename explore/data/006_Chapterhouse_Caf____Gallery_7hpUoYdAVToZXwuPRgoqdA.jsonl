This is fine, it's an event, you can't rate a place based on that. But... the barista, a twenty-something guy with long hair, was so unpleasant it ruined the whole experience for me. I asked about sandwiches, he said they were all out. Of ALL of them. Okay. I asked about a coffee. He said they didn't make that particular style. No biggie. So I order a plain iced coffee and day-old danish, and as he is ringing me up, I ask about what was going on and if it was always this busy, as this was my first time. He looks at me and shrugs, \"I don't know.\" Seriously? \n\nHe must have made my coffee and placed it on the counter without me knowing, because next thing I know he's making a smoothie. I'm watching him, confused, and we made eye contact several times.

I have lived a half block from the chapterhouse for going on 3 years, and I had never been there. I do not know why. I've always been a starbucks girl, even though I know I shouldn't have.

I want to curl up in a chair and just stay. Which is sad because I generally go here the most when I'm already late for work and grabbing a latte to go. Their lattes are unlike anything I've ever had. The espresso they use is bold, yet mellow and not bitter at all. The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \n\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in. It was like ever since her show I kept thinking, I should really try this place. \n\nAnyway. I usually get a iced soy latte, or a black and white soy latte, or the iced coffee. I've seen the gorgeous things they do with the steamed milk going into the espresso, they truly are artists at the coffee bar.

It's hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\n\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you're doing something wrong.)\n\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don't object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I've been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I'm a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn't part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\n\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who's welcome, definitely go elsewhere. I plan to from now on.", "date": "2008-12-19 15:00:44", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 2.0, "yelping_since": "2008-12-19 14:49:51"}}

The staff at the Expressive Hand gave us some coupons for a free coffee or tea, so we headed over to wait out our time.\n\nFirst of all, the place is nice on the inside and quite cozy. There are bar stools overlooking the store front, and lots of small tables. Another plus is that the large bookshelf in the middle room is full of games and puzzles and even playing cards. The BF and I kept ourselves amused with a never-ending game of Uno, so we really appreciated the fact that Chapterhouse had distractions available. \n  \nHowever, that's where the positives end, unfortunately. The baristas were pretty grumpy when we asked them what drinks we'd be eligible for with our coupons (understandable), but their attitude didn't even change after we tipped them. Rude. My tea lacked flavor and my crappy paper cup (hello, sustainability!) had a slow leak which meant I lost most of my drink to the tabletop. Blah. Lastly, on a Sunday afternoon, the place was super packed. Most people looked like they hadn't moved in eons from their tables and didn't plan on moving for another several millenniums either. If I had paid good money for a cup of coffee and atmosphere, I'd be pretty annoyed that there was no space to sit. We ended up sitting on two slightly uncomfortable plastic chairs by the bookshelves, awkwardly adjacent to a couple sprawled on the sofa. \n\nTo sum it up - this place put me too close for comfort with some snooty hipsters and meh beverages.

Lots of seating, and *generally* far apart enough that you can have your personal space, rest your purse/lunchbox/bookbag/briefcase next to you without feeling like an asshole.\n2.

These are the cheapest prices I've seen at an independent coffee shop, and they have a great selection.\n4. A LOT of people here are studying. This is where people who \"work from home\" are actually working. Every once in a while someone annoying is having a loud chat here, but it's rare, and you can always go downstairs (see # 5).\n5. Secret basement area for SERIOUS studying/working.\n6. Dog therapy. There is a dog who lives here/works here/hangs out here. He's friendly.\n7. Low, minimal annoyance music.\n8. Friendly, unpretentious barristas who won't bother you or be in your way, or judge you if you pack your own snacks/lunch/dinner (Hint: Whole Foods is a block away).\n9. Decent food. Tried the tomato mozzarella and it was great-although I don't like olives and they're pre-made so...something to consider.\n10. Hours! Open till 10! Seriously serious about that serious working vibe.\n\nOnly con is the credit card minimum and slight shortage of outlets in the backroom along the wall. (But if you need an outlet, there will be an open one). Also some of the chairs are made of bungee cord material that conform to your butt, which is kinda odd. \n\nAlso!

And by the time I drag my behind out of the house to study, I have about 5 minutes to get settled in somewhere before I've lost momentum or been distracted by something else.  So that's hit-or-miss.  HOWEVER, they have \"recently\" opened a downstairs, so it may be less difficult to find a work space than in the past.  (2) The chairs aren't that comfortable.  They have a lot of those chairs with stringy bodies that are just not sturdy enough for my personal taste.  I need comfort and security to get work done.  What can I say?  (3) The music is often too distracting.  It can be loud and not pleasant, the kind of stuff I might enjoy if I were really paying attention, but don't get into when I want to forget about music altogether and hone in on my tedious reading.  \n\nThe coffee is good, though, and the prices are great.  They don't take cards for a simple coffee purchase, though, and since I'm usually strapped for cash, that's another reason I rarely find myself at Chapterhouse.

As far as I'm concerned, it's the best coffee shop in the (slightly extended) Center City Philadelphia area. There are equally good coffee shops in other neighborhoods.\n\nChapterhouse has everything you'd expect in a good coffeeshop; fair-trade, organic coffee made with purified water, inexpensive (50 cent) refills, soy milk, free wi-fi, ample seating (there's actually a stairway to the second floor tucked in the back), and an ambient iPod mix that only comes out of the background when you want it to.

I used to live two blocks away from Chapterhouse, and it was my go-to coffee place for a year and a half. Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\n\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\n\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\n\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\n\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat. But as coffeeshops go, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more versatile, interesting, and welcoming one. \n\nThis is exactly the kind of place I want to open someday.

The comment was in a very accusatory/surprised tone, like I had either helped myself to some hot water or failed to pay for something that was....free. It was very off putting. \n\nFinally, the food is nothing to write home about. The selection is pretty slim. If you want a muffin or danish, you can get one, but it will probably be gluten, sugar, and dairy free with a side of hipster arrogance. To me, that is not worth the calories. \n\nMaybe all the studying is getting to my head, maybe I am grumpy, or maybe this place really is losing it's charm...", "date": "2016-04-13 20:15:08", "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 337, "average_stars": 4.14, "yelping_since": "2014-04-11 16:24:18"}}

I wonder how often he does that, since there seem to be no references to the Ron Paul revolution in the current reviews. Then again, maybe Philly hipsters like Ron Paul. \n\nIn any case, this review is emphatically NOT based on my feelings about the Chapterhouse's proud libertarianism. If you want to advocate an antebellum states' rights federalism, that is totally your prerogative. \n\nInstead, it's the customer service that is lacking. Haranguing private messages to your clientele are a tad bit uncouth, but the sullenness and near-hostility I've encountered from the baristas on both of my return visits have driven home to me that this is just not a very friendly and inviting place. Which is a shame, because the coffee is okay, the music is pretty solid, and the seats are surprisingly comfortable.

When you approach the counter you will be greeted warmly and given time to choose what you'd like to order.  There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\n\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\n\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\n\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\n\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.  Also I remember the two previous incarnations of the space, Grinds and Finds, a vintage clothing store/cafe, followed by an unpronounceable, short lived, lackluster cafe.   The owners of Chapterhouse did a marvelous job renovating their space into a light and airy experience.", "date": "2013-01-21 21:39:26", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 11, "average_stars": 3.5, "yelping_since": "2009-11-23 23:03:42"}}

(Not blotches of paint with PBR cans and cigarette butts on a canvas and words etched \"my generation is dead\".) \n\nBut the owner can rub people off the wrong way, especially if you go into the Starbucks down the st., which has not really effected their business. Starbucks will always cater to people who already love that kind of corporate formula. \n\nAnyway for the most part I enjoy this place and I came many times with friends to enjoy a cup and exchange pieces of minds. I love the \"it's like I'm in someones home/ interior\" and I feel like I should ask someone if it's OK I'm even here. Will the owner pop up and go \"Who the fuck are you?! Why are you in my house man!?\" Just kidding. But especially in the back it's homey. Complete with sketchbooks to add doodles in, old mags, vintage and updated Ikea-style furniture. Not bad. \n\nThough my only complaint and why they get three stars is well...\n\nAn employee was kind of taken back of me. I stood politely around 3pm about a year from now waiting to get a bagel. The barista was busy stocking cups and refilling syrup bottles. I know what it's like and allowed him to continue his chores till finally after five minutes he turned around and whipped out \"What?!\". I said \"Um... A bagel with cream cheese.\" He sighed and pointed to an empty basket. I nodded and he said, \"What else?\". I just smiled, waved and walked out. He might had mumbled something as I left but I made it clear that he failed to do a simple task. A task I know can be hard to do at all times but it's something we are paid with the job of food service to do. I know we all have it tough but handing out negative energy is like a leech and it attaches itself very tightly to your balls. \n\nSo will I stop coming here? No. There are still positive things in mind and some other employees aren't so bad. Though I know the majority of them give better service to people they eye up and go \"Oh my god! I know she likes \"Kate Bush\"!\" You'd be surprised what people really are underneath their \"Ramones\" t-shirt.

The barista, her name is Michelle, she has red-curly hair and I believe that she is referenced in other comments in a not so positive light. Anyway, today I was inspecting various shops, books stores, etc in Philadelphia to find a spot for my next book signing (I am an author). I popped into Chapter House for about 35 minutes to send an email, considered the possibility of doing a book signing here and waiting for my girlfriend. Upon leaving the cafe, the cashier, Michelle, yells from the counter and across the room, \"You didn't buy anything... this isn't a study hall where you just come and don't buy anything\". I was appalled and turned around, as I couldn't believe I was being badgered from across the cafe by a barista. I explained to the barista that I always buy something when I come to this cafe and that I just didn't today, as I was in a hurry. She continued to badger me in an attempt to humiliate me in front of the entire cafe.  She said \"everyone else in here has bought something\". This is even more alarming as I beg to know how/why she focused her attention on ME. Her presumptions of me, as a kid \"at a study hall\" may have been most appalling as I am a doctor, far from a child using the cafe as a \"study hall\". Shouldn't matter if I were. I called once I left to ask her for her managers name and she refused to give me the managers name! Unbelievable. I will be sending a letter in the mail, as well as trying to get in contact with the owner/ manager again today or tomorrow. This is not the way to treat a patron, it was unprofessional and disgusting to say the least. To boot, my colleague was at the cafe witnessing this entire incident.

The interior is very cute and cozy but is somewhat cramped. There was a lot of people there when I came by. It seemed like the staff was having trouble keeping up with the crowd and I had to wait quite a while for my order.

I had to physically go to a staff member and ask for the WiFi - which is something I normally don't like doing and definitely cuts back on the time of the staff who was already swamped with orders. \n\nI got the Apple Spice smoothie and it was very sweet and refreshing. Definitely a must-try, especially for the fall season. \n\nThere weren't that many tables with outlets and some of the tables were wobbly. Furthermore, there was only one toilet from what I could tell and with the amount of people going in and out, it was definitely not going to be so clean down the line. However, the problem was the WiFi itself. It was so slow. It lagged so much that it couldn't even load a page. There were times when it worked but it was so brief. It was very irritating trying to do work with such a slow WiFi.\n\nHonestly, the cafe was overcrowded and its facilities weren't the best. The only saving grace was their drinks.

When I look for a good coffeehouse I search a good vibe and atmosphere that perfect for getting some work done, an impressive variety of drink offerings, delicious food offerings, board games to play and house books to read, and a variety of fantastic art on the wall (and there's always bonus points for a cute house dog). And when I came back to Chapterhouse for Book Club I got to revisit how much of these things it has to offer, and that's exactly why I enjoy it thoroughly (too bad the dog wasn't there!).\n\nAnd for what it's worth, while I'll agree in a heartbeat that Christopher needs to step away from things like talk threads so that Shannon can be the voice of mediation when a situation arises (just saying since she definitely does the better job of it), I will stand by the fact that I have had good service from him in the past. He goes the extra mile by making sure that your not allergic to any ingredient in the more involved drinks, and goes the extra mile with his preparation. And while he might of seemed a little more distant every time he heard the mention of Yelp (not to say I don't particularly blame him given the fustercluck that I'd rather not talk about) during the Book Club, he didn't miss a beat.
