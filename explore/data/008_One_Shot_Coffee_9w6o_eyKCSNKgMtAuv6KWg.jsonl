Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, only to discover that the food was below mediocre. Maybe they were just having a bad day, who knows.\n\nWe ordered a simple mocha latte, the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a bagel, and a regular plate of breakfast food items (forgot the menu name). \n\nFirst, the ultimate breakfast sandwich: besides the bagel tasting like rubber, the sandwich overall was overwhelmingly greasy. I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \n\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \n\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \n\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

The music was also decent, not overbearingly hip-tastic, but not the pop charts top 100 either.\nThey always had an abundant amount of vegan options for cookies, cakes, bagels, and my fav-  pumpkin whoopie pies, mmmmmm.\n\nThe new location on George St.:\n\nI have to say, I would like to go here just to hang out because its so damn pretty. Exposed brick, wood paneling misplaced over hot pink walls. Super comfy and chic, tufted back bench seating . Overall, really a visual pleasure. It feels like Urbanoutfitters Inc got a hold of this place beforehand and then One Shot moved in.\n\nHowever, the happy, shiny, good times stop there. I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one! I heard some rumors about this behavior before I went there and I was surprised how accurate the description was. The girls at the old place were so nice! The barista who recently served me acted really annoyed when my friend and I placed our order. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, it was right from the menu. She just seemed like I was ruining her life by ordering. Whatever lady, I was super nice to you. Maybe next time I could tip you in bug repellent so that nasty one will crawl out of your ass.\n\nIts cool, I don't need anymore friends. However, I NEED food, good food.  I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped. As for the scramble, which in theory sounded amazing, was really lack luster. There was supposed to be fennel in it, but I guess they ran out and decided not to say anything, even though that's why I ordered it in the first place.\n\nOverall:\n\nVegan eats= The Suck (and no more whoopie pies= worst) but dont worry, you can buy a $5 cookie.\n\nService= Unnecessary attitude city\n\nCoffee= overpriced, but great.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\n\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\n\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

Maybe the system you use to complete transactions wouldn't allow you to process the request - but I find that hard to believe, and harder to believe there isn't a way around that if it was the case...Its not like the kitchen's packed and cleaned up the bagels, or the coffee at 10:01. Its just not the kind of service I would've predicted from such an otherwise solid establishment - especially when other, closer-to-home coffee shop options are available - doesn't competition drive some sense of flexibility or courtesy to the customer - its Monday morning for all of us, right? $4 for a bagel and 12oz. of coffee is still delivering a substantial profit no matter what time of day you're ordering it. \nI ended up ordering a tofu breakfast burrito (I'm vegan, it was admittedly good), and the coffee is always good (kinda hard to \"F\" up Stumptown brews anyway), but after that experience, my order stopped there.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe's instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\n\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it's a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week's theme was Hawai'i. \n\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \n\nThe croissant french toast wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend's breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\n\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

The whole event went without a hitch, the service was impeccable, friendly and the menu crafted especially for the event was perfection (there was this caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, and a small pat\u00e9 chinois- shepherd's pie - a nod to my french canadian heritage, and the most yummy macarons, amongst other delicious tidbits that were to die for!).   \n\n It doesn't hurt that the whole place is so uniquely gorgeous.  The artwork, the lighting, repurposed vintage items, the open space design that still makes the place feel cozy and personal, the beautiful bathrooms (seriously beautiful bathrooms), the cute curved booths on the first floor and the seating upstairs, it just works, you know?  \n\nThe coffee is super strong  (like I like it) and the food is killer.  Go there early in the morning and experience their baked goods hot and fresh out of the oven.  This morning, for example, had a blueberry and peach scone that rocked my world.  It's the little things.  All their baked goods are super yummy, and don't get me started on their breakfast, brunch menu - sweet baby jesus - their ultimate breakfast sandwich contains some of my most favorite items on earth: a brioche bun, brie, bacon, hash brown and two fried eggs.  Hello lover.  Breakfast of champions right there.  Just give it a whirl, you won't ever look back.\n\nIt's the perfect place to grab a quick dose of caffeine, or while away your hours as you nibble on a croissant and get caught up on your blog lovin', or go upstairs where it's quieter with one of their daily crafted non-caffeinated options and catch up on your reading (with a book, not a kindle).", "date": "2013-08-24 12:56:33", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 371, "average_stars": 3.39, "yelping_since": "2008-12-15 23:29:58"}}

It's kind of like reviewing a movie - how you feel about it is not only based on THEIR effort, the cinematography, the writing, the casting, etc etc... it's also based on everything you've been through in your life up until the day you see the movie.  Reviewing coffee shops - not an objective practice in any way.  The reviews help, sure, especially if all 30 of them say, \"I got food poisoning from the camembert quiche.\"  Sure, take THEM to heart. But don't weigh too heavily in general.\n\nThat said, let me get down from my soap box and talk about One Shot.  I really like it there.  Sometimes, I am treated like a queen (mostly, when I go see my beautiful friend Kelly who I love a lot and who I think is a great barista), and sometimes I am treated like a slightly annoying citizen.  But that's life, and I do not need my ass kissed 24/7, even in the service industry.  (If you think a barista's job is to make you feel like the most important little latte drinking princess in the world, I suggest you buy a coffee maker.)  The coffee/espresso is lovely and does what it's supposed to, like a charm.  The food is inventive and consistently prepared, and the prices are competitive.  The music is enjoyable and the vibe is deliciously relaxed, especially for a shop that resides in a shiny, glossed over, gentrified mini-mall in the middle of a neighborhood halfway between Hipster Heaven and Get Out, We Were Here First.  I like when the sun spills into the windows onto the slouchy, old furniture.  I like to go when I can't look at my work laptop anymore and I need a tiny little dose of Yay Life Rules.  So, from a totally biased perspective, influenced by every other coffee shop I've ever been to (or worked in, god help me), I highly recommend One Shot.", "date": "2009-09-25 03:01:59", "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 42, "average_stars": 4.14, "yelping_since": "2009-09-23 18:16:44"}}

I really don't think they appreciate their customers at all.  The food and coffee are good enough, but lately I've been thinking I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.  I guess it won't matter to them though, because there seems to be an endless parade of the tattooed hip to spend money there all the same.\n\nTwo instances come to mind.\n\nOn a hot day, I wanted a really cold drink.  I chose the beet juice from the open cooler in the front - it didn't really seem very cold, so I asked if I could have some ice for it.  This drink costs almost $7, but the woman at the counter had the gall to charge me 50 cents for it.  Yeah, I know, it's only 50 cents, but come on.  I am spending $7 for the drink, not to mention the rest of the food we got.  Last I heard, ice wasn't a very expensive item for restaurants to supply. Most will just give it to you for free.\n\nAlso, another time it was winter, and I got one of their fancy overpriced hot drink specials on the specials board.  When I took my first sip, it was kind of luke warm.  I asked if they could just please pop it in the microwave for me to heat it up a bit.  The woman (I think one of the owners) looked at me with a face of HORROR and spit out her words in disgust UGHHHH!!!!  We don't have a MICROWAVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!   So I asked what she could do for me, she said UGH!!! I GUESS I CAN PUT A SHOT OF ESPRESSO IN THERE, BUT THATS IT!!!!!!!!\n\nSo the drink I probably paid over $5 for, which was lukewarm, and SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICELY REMADE FOR ME, if you didn't have a microwave, was made 1% warmer with the addition of espresso.  In addition, she yelled at me in front of everyone in line, humiliating me.  Owner or not, she needs some lessons in customer service.\n\nPro tip - Cafe Chismosa is right down the street with better coffee, better food, better prices AND better customer service.", "date": "2013-08-12 13:39:48", "useful": 16, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 253, "average_stars": 4.02, "yelping_since": "2010-02-03 19:34:00"}}

Somehow the excellent food, quality espresso beverages and well thought out d\u00e9cor amassed in a perfect permutation, making our breakfast at One Shot one of the most delightful parts of our recent trip to Philly. \n\nAs I waited at a table by a window I could quickly tell by glancing around that the owners and workers care wholeheartedly about the product they put out and the happiness of their customers. Their dedication, work ethic and contentment were readily apparent by even the most cursory observation. Similarly, a peek at the tables and a glance at the quickly moving line showed one of the most diverse crowds I've ever seen at a coffee house - a real testament to this shop as it appeals to everyone.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not a Philadelphian so I can't come here regularly, and even more unfortunate, we had only popped in to fulfill my morning need for coffee and grab an edible accompaniment, we weren't going to stay for a full lunch. We decided to split the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich (brioche bun, brie, bacon, giant hash brown, two eggs with just enough runniness) and selected our drinks, then Justin went to order while I camped out at the table. When he came back he had one of their Mexican chocolate cronuts with him. It's the little things in life that make the biggest difference and this was no exception - not only because it was an awesome cronut with great flavor and texture and paired well with my cappuccino, but because my partner has impeccable taste and knows exactly what I will like. \n\nAfter we finished our breakfast we took a turn around the caf\u00e9. Both upstairs and downstairs are absolutely adorable. Each vintage element is placed perfectly and seems like it would have a story. The upstairs is much less hectic, has a little library and would be the perfect place to sit and catch up with a girlfriend over brunch. The menus of specials are hand written and decorated on giant butcher paper rolls - love it. Even the downstairs bathroom is beautiful with its old fashioned lace curtain and mock window. \n\nThe concept, design and execution of every aspect of One Shot are perfect.

What I came to find was the food was alright and the coffee was slightly above par.  Here's what I got:\n\nCoffee - I just got the regular black drip coffee because I feel like that is the best way for you to know just how good a cafe's coffee really is.  While I wasn't disappointed with it, it also was nothing to write home about.  With how competitive the coffee market is in Philly, this isn't something I would immediately recommend to a visiting coffee coffee snob.  My girlfriend got a latte that was pretty damn good, and maybe that's One Shot's claim to fame more than anything.  Coffee isn't bad and it's a definite good place to stop in and have a cup - just nothing that I'd be running back to week in and week out.\n\nFood - I got the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich which I thought was going to be phenomenal.  It was very good, but once again, it wasn't quite what I was expecting (in a negative way).  The brioche bun was fairly bland and added little to the overall sandwich while the hashbrown was probably the best part of the entire thing.  Brie wasn't necessarily the best selection of cheese for this sandwich either that lacked a true *oomph* factor.  I was left wanting more in the area of flavor.  I would probably eat this again, but not before trying something different on their menu.  I'd suggest if you're going to One Shot for breakfast, stick to their specials.  This is what fills their social media accounts most often and probably is their best offering.

We pull up and we got lucky- parking right outside the place.  I have a feeling though that if we didn't get lucky, we would have had to park a couple blocks down because the parking isnt the best.  With that aside, we walked into this little corner shop tucked away nicely and was immediately greeted by the staff behind the counter.  The decor was warm, cozy and antique which I love.  Exposed walls, original ceilings, old fashioned light bulbs fashioned into unique lighting fixtures, the whole deal (see pictures).   I ordered the garden bagel and my boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast.  He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.  The prices were a little steep (which took away from 5 stars) but that is to be expected in this area I suppose.

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\n\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \n\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\n\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \n\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \n\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \n\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.
