It wasn't what I've typically come to expect a crabcake to be. It was more like a crab salad patty that was tossed on the grill for about a minute. It was actually served  lukewarm. \n\nOkay.. so the crabcake was different than I expected.... but it was still GOOD once I got that idea out of my head. The sweet potato fries were very good, but not hot enough!  I thought the dipping sauce was the perfect condiment for the fries.\n\nBut... BY FAR, the highlight of this mean was the dessert. We ordered a Xando, which is described on the menu as:Rich Cheese Cake Filling Wrapped in a Cinnamon-Sugar Coated Crispy Pastry with a Raspberry Drizzle.

I had the Bibam Bap with seitan -- it was listed as vegan, or so I thought. The food was good enough to bring me back again tonight....\n\nAnd despite a good experience last week, tonight the Bubble House experience was HORRENDOUS.  I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.  She meant well and could not have been responsible for the service disaster that followed.  \n\nThey were completely out of seitan, the basis for many of the veg versions of the dishes. That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\n\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\n\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

This is BY FAR the WORSE dining experience I've EVER had!! With all the poor reviews, I'm surprised they make enough to pay the rent each month. Pay close attention to the bad reviews because they are all VERY accurate. Very poor service and management all around. I'm honestly disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying this place.\n\nThere are so many things that went wrong with our dinner that I hardly know where to begin. First of all, not only did they get our order almost completely wrong, we got something we didn't even order.\n\nInstead of getting the Calamari appetizer that we asked for, we got a Calamari salad, which cost more.\n\nInstead of getting just a burger, I got one with an extra side that I also did not order, which cost more as well.\n\nInstead of getting a MEDIUM steak, my bf got a VERY RARE piece of beef that was lightly seared at most. I should not neglect to mention, however, that they did fix our raw meat problem...they magically turned it into rubber! I didn't know that could be done--amazing!\n\nYou would think that at a place called \"Bubble House\" you could at least get some decent bubble tea. Boy, was I mistaken. Also the worse bubble tea I've every had...& that's saying a lot. Instead of getting the frosted (blended) bubble tea that we anticipated, we got some severely watered-down concoction...and surprisingly enough, the tapioca balls were entirely undercooked. As a matter of fact, the calamari seemed to be the only thing that wasn't undercooked...it was nice and chewy!\n\nDid I mention the chicken wings that we did NOT order and had to pay for anyway?! Ironically, that was probably the best dish we got.\n\nAnd to top it off, they wouldn't allow us to use the Restaurant.com certificate that we had, even though we ordered well more than the $50 min spend (\"Valid for food only. Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that's right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2! Of course, they couldn't just apply the cert as a courtesy after all the mistakes that were already made. That was way too much to ask. What WASN'T too much to ask, apparently, was a full 20% tip automatically applied to our check (which was NOT specified in their cert btw, or anywhere else for that matter).  While they did adjust our check for the two earlier mistakes, we still ended up paying a lot more than we had hoped.\n\nNeedless to say, I did not love this place. Take my advice...If you ever find yourself walking over to the Bubble House, just keep on walking...over to the White Dog Cafe next door.", "date": "2009-09-25 01:14:47", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 1.0, "yelping_since": "2009-09-24 21:34:27"}}

Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped me with some vegetarian options. I  ended up going with something light, the Chop Chop salad, and my friend had the red curry with seitan. The curry was a little spicy for my taste, but she loved it. I then ruined my light lunch and ordered the xando (?), which I can only describe as fried cheesecake topped with cinnamon and raspberry sauce. I thought I died and went to heaven. \nWe also ordered one chai bubble tea   and one sweetened jasmine green bubble tea. They were both delicious and I personally liked them better than those I've had a bakeries in Chinatown. Though Bubble House charges nearly $1 more for a tea, the portions were larger AND you decide whether or not in comes in smoothie form.\nI will definitely be back to this place and will be sure to bring more people with me!", "date": "2009-09-30 02:51:06", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 13, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2009-04-29 04:01:46"}}

It had been weeks since I'd had a burger, and I was at my breaking point. When this happens, I often settle. And I don't like settling...especially when it comes to meat. \n\nThe burger at Bubble House is obviously a hand-shaped patty that they top with melted Gouda (yes!), Asian jalapeno sauce, lettuce and tomato, all snuggled by two slices of focaccia. It's messy, but if the burger's not messy, then it's likely not very good (am I right?). The salad was doused with a light, tasty dressing. \n\nMy pearl tea was also quite nice. (I always get taro root.) \n\nAnyway, that missing star is due to something most of the other reviewers mentioned: the service. While our waiter was really friendly and attentive, it was as awkward as...I don't know, something really awkward when we arrived and waited to be seated. About four employees looked at us and carried on as if we weren't there at all. My message to you: be proactive! Don't seat yourself, but make sure some sort of Bubble House employee knows you exist and notifies a server of customer life.", "date": "2009-06-01 20:08:15", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 284, "average_stars": 3.98, "yelping_since": "2005-07-11 19:51:59"}}

The tea selection is light, but varied. The tea pots certainly are a good touch for the hot teas. Boba varies day-to-day, but generally acceptable, if a little bit overcooked.\n\nSeating and spacing is relatively airy for the location, and the place expanded downstairs after a short renovation at the store's inception and now also branched into the former card shop's space to the East.  Original entry point on the South is not handicapped accessible, but I believe they put in another door. \n\nFood is lackluster. Best selection - the sweet potato fries. The Vietnamese hoagie was uninspiring (you can get better in Chinatown for half the price).  Other food selections were either bland or tasted overly strong of one sauce or ingredient. Worst were the side of noodles. It was fairly plain.\n\nTake-out counter is usually stocked with random flyers and is fairly swift. Cost is normal for the area, between $11-14 for a meal and a drink, per person.\n\nI've never seen alcohol served here, so I'm not sure why people indicate they have a full bar, but then again, this place has changed quite a bit.", "date": "2008-11-10 16:52:20", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 3327, "average_stars": 2.7, "yelping_since": "2008-02-18 15:21:13"}}

But my dining companion wanted to give it a shot so I decided to toughen it out. And to my surprise I found the house to be pretty decent.\n\nI can understand why traditionalists hate it because it's anything but traditional. If you want to grab a standard bubble tea and a Vietnamese hoagie go directly to places like O and Zen Tea House. But if your looking for chewy tapioca goodness with some coffeehouse innovations you might want to give Bubble House a try. While I'd be stumped by these options at most other places, I found choices like chocolate latte and orange creamsicle to be pretty cool. I tried the mix of pineapple and lychee bubbles and found them to be a gross mistake though. don't do it!\n\nWhile reading these reviews another thing I was fearing was the food. But I kept it simple and got some great stuff. The calamari was super huge and good to the last bite. The veggie spring rolls were huge, but not he best. The sweet potato fries were incredible! The service was also pretty dead on. So even if it's not traditional you're still going to find enough reasons to give Bubble House a try every once in a blue moon.", "date": "2008-07-15 18:02:17", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 1512, "average_stars": 4.17, "yelping_since": "2007-07-13 04:00:59"}}
