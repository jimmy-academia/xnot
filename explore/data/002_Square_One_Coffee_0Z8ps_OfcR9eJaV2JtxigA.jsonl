The biggest pitfall here, though, is that the \"large\" size iced drink is about 16 oz - roughly the size of a grande at Starbucks for reference. And not filled all the way up. I can only imagine what a small is... there are so many great coffee shops in the area so I think I will stick to those and skip this place in the future.", "date": "2019-08-20 13:29:35", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 54, "average_stars": 4.0, "yelping_since": "2014-05-27 12:27:25"}}

The space is bright, inviting, and conducive to productivity, and I was digging the overall atmosphere as soon as I walked in.\n\nWhat I wasn't digging, though, was my latte. I'm used to my suburban coffee shop whipping up a smooth, silky oat milk latte each and every time. Literally, my only complaint is that it once arrived too hot.\n\nThe latte I received here made me miss my neighborhood oasis. Square One's latte was bitter, because the coffee was bitter. I noticed that the barista used Pacific brand oat milk. Not Oatly, but the next best thing, and what my local place uses. This bitter latte also cost me $6.50. Ouch!\n\nI don't think I'd return here for any reason. There are too many coffee options close by, and I have a feeling plenty of them have perfected the latte.", "date": "2019-02-08 15:16:27", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 101, "average_stars": 3.94, "yelping_since": "2014-02-21 15:42:26"}}

So when I saw that the Lancaster based operation was opening a house in Philly I was enticed and ready to give it a shot. And even if it was in a location that was in close proximity to spots like Last Drop, Good Karma, and Green Street; it delivered on enough fronts to make it stand outside of the pack.\n\nUpon entering I was enamored by the comfortable space with sleek wooden decor. Add in the fact that I was instantly greeted upon entry by a welcoming barista and it was a double win. Given that I had already spent a good bit of time at Coffeehouse and just needed to give my phone a recharge I was only really looking for an iced treat. And I found salvation in their iced caramel mocha which packed a perfect wallop of sweet caramel and chocolate.\n\nHad I have been looking for more of a caffeine craze I would have likely taken advantage of their fine coffee varieties by filter or cold brew. While Green Street is the only other aforementioned spot to feature the unique variety of their own blends, Square One is the one to do it at the better price points amongst the more well rounded options and roomer location.

I stopped by on a Sunday morning with my father and it wasn't busy at all. In fact, most of the time I walk by, it seems pretty calm. When the weather is warmer, locals can be seen sitting in the tables outside sipping drinks with their adorable pups. \n\nLAYOUT: The layout is VERY spacious and clean, which is a rare find for a coffee shop in Philadelphia. There are always people sitting and studying, but it never feels claustrophobic unlike some other popular spots in the neighborhood. The music is soft enough to concentrate on your work or conversation. If only the shop stayed open a couple hours longer, this would be the *perfect* study spot.\n\nBARISTAS: The baristas we encountered today were great. I even accidentally grabbed someone's gibraltar thinking it was my cappuccino (my bad, guys.. how embarrassing) and the barista assured me it was okay!\n\nCOFFEE: The coffee they brew up is delicious as well. I noticed the baristas weighing out the beans before grinding them to order, which tells me that they are dedicated to consistency. \n\nI will definitely be back more often to study, as my old study spots have fizzled out.", "date": "2018-01-08 01:25:57", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 108, "average_stars": 4.2, "yelping_since": "2011-07-30 19:45:57"}}
