Another ZOMG experience!\n\nI can't believe it took us this long to give Manakeesh a try. We had past by it so many times, and I had wondered about it. Having \"bakery\" in their title is a little deceiving. I was under the impression that it was a place for deserts and maybe breads, but not so much for a meal. Boy was I wrong.\n\nI started with this orange and cream, creamsicle like, tasting drink. It was pretty tasty. Although, it was way better when it was full then it was once it was drained and the ice started melting in it. For some reason, it didn't maintain the perfect flavor from start to finish. And, I did not take long to suck it down.\n\nNext, I had the Shawarma Manakeesh with salad added. I was really glad I added the salad. I did not realize it, but Manakeesh is a large pita like bread folded like a taco and stuffed with the filling of your choice. In this case, it was filled with Shawarma. Had I not added salad, it would have been a meat with some onions and tomatoes and not much else sandwich. Adding the salad was key. All this said, it was awesome. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. I practically devoured this monster sized taco in ten minutes.\n\nMy wife got Veggie Manakeesh and added hummus. She really enjoyed it too.\n\nWe also shared a side of Baba Ghannouj. It was made to perfection. It was so tasty. $3.75 for the portion we got was a little more than it should be, but it's hard to complain considering the quality and how inexpensive the Manakeesh  sandwiches were.\n\nThen, there was the deserts. We got a little crazy. We decided to share three deserts. We got the Black Forrest Cake, Tiramisu, and an eclair with strawberries in the middle looking desert. Now, these are not what you would expect, as they have a middle eastern flair/interpretation to them. The Tiramisu was okay, a little disappointing only because I like the traditional style so much and this did not live up to it. It wasn't bad though. The eclair thing was pretty good, but also not great. The Black Forrest, however, was the real winner. The cake was moist and tasty. The cream in it was nearly perfect. The fruit, which was not your typical raspberry, was great. I think it was mango and something else, but I am not certain. But whatever, it was awesome. And the chocolate sprinkled on it was delish.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent spot and I will be back many times.", "date": "2012-05-02 16:03:23", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 493, "average_stars": 3.44, "yelping_since": "2011-05-04 18:02:07"}}

This past week, I finally made my way over, and thank god I did!  (I have been there twice since :) )\n\nManakeesh is a cozy little cafe-like bakery making FRESH from scratch Lebanese baked goods and foods.  They serve Turkish Coffee and other espresso/coffee/tea drinks too.  The menu includes some appetizers, Lebanese flat breads and wraps, and a few platters.  In addition to the main cafe room at Manakeesh, there is a connecting small Middle-Eastern grocery shop with a full smoothie & crepe bar.  OMG.\n\nThe first time I was at Manakeesh, I ordered the Turkish Coffee.  It is very strong coffee with Cardamom.  It was served piping hot and was delicious.  I also got a to-go order of the Tabbouleh.  The small is pretty big and was less than $4.  It was full of fresh bright green parsley, amazing.\n\nI had to come back to Manakeesh with my fiance- Middle Eastern food is one of his favorites so it was only right to bring him back and get the full experience.  We ordered the Za'tar Flatbread (with veggies: cucumber, tomato, onion, olives) and we each got a platter- he picked the Chicken Schwarma and I got the Beef Schwarma.  The platters each came with hummus, salad, fresh pita bread, and the meat was served over a very large bed of rice.  We could have just ordered one- it was a ton of food.  \n\nThe Za'tar flatbread was outstanding.  I highly recommend trying it, especially if you haven't heard of Za'tar yet.  Get it with or without the veggies- I'm sure both ways are fantastic.  Everything here is cooked in an open-flame oven which gives the bread an amazing smoky flavor.  \n\nThe platters were also seriously awesome.  The meat was super flavorful and very tender.  I don't typically like to fill up on rice, but this rice was delicious and worth it.  The hummus was a bit oily for what I prefer but of course it tasted amazing.  I also enjoyed the salad, it was light but had some fresh pita chips sprinkled over top which was a nice touch.  The pita unfortunately came out about 4 minutes after our platters, so I took mine home since it was so big anyway.  It made for a perfect late-night snack that night- still probably the best pita bread I've had outside of Israel.  \n\nThis place is legit.  It's the real deal.

The food was very solid, but there were a few quirks of the service that makes me knock them down. We were a group of 8, and some of us ordered together (groups of 2 or 3) and others flew solo.  It was not the easiest of groups to manage, I suppose, by nevertheless...\n\nThe hummus and baba ghanoush made a great opening act.  The bread came out hot, and piping fresh.  But then the server came back and TOOK AWAY a piece of bread!  He gave us 1 too many apparently.  And he took one away just as my friend was tearing into it!  Weird, right?  I mean, fine, maybe you should only get 2.  But it's bread, not truffles!  And PS, bread adds $1 onto the price of each of these; if you hold your horses, you can use the bread of your manakeesh and forego extra. \n\nThen the manakeesh started flowing, and the server just kind of put them down without explaining which was which, leaving us all to fend for ourselves in figuring out who got what and whose was whose.  It was finally sorted, and I will say that the chicken tawook was my favorite.  Moist chicken, great garlic sauce.  The hot cheese and red peppers was pretty disappointing in the lack of cheese.  The lamb lahm bajeen was also tasty.  Falafel was solid.  Then we realized two orders of labneh never came.  So we went to ask for them, and then they arrived.  \n\nPretty much everyone got a fresh lemonade ($4) as well.  They came, without ICE!  Apparently they were out of ice... so so much for our thirst quenching, cold lemonade.  It comes with a free refill, as well, so there was ice in time for that as they ran out to get some.  But two ice cubes in the refill didn't really cool me down.  And worst, I highly doubt the lemonade could fairly be called \"fresh\".  \n\nSo, all in all, decent food, weird quirks of service, but the prices are good, so, perhaps I'll make a repeat appearance.", "date": "2012-07-04 15:12:46", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 191, "average_stars": 3.49, "yelping_since": "2011-01-22 16:07:48"}}

It's a bit different than I remember. There's a juice shop add-on where the soda fountains were. I actually tried to come back sooner but they were closed for Ramadan. So after looking over the menu, I was set on trying some different things that caught my eye. This is what I had... chicken shwarma, chai tea hot, basboosa, and a napolean to go. I had a yelp deal and that stuff came to $20... just over it with tax.\n\nHere's why I'm giving 3 stars again. I learned my lesson from the last time, but they didn't. The service was awkward. I said that I wanted a shwarma and just like before I wasn't asked what I wanted on it. I also said that I wanted some desserts so I walked over to the other side. The woman just stayed at the register. I had to flag her down and wave for her to come over. After I chose what I wanted and paid up. I watched the guy making the food (he was stellar) and again I noticed all of the vegetables. So I asked him what comes on the shwarma. He told me and I told him what I wanted... instead. Done deal. I went outside to grab a table. My shwarma came out, but my tea didn't. I had to go back in and ask for my tea. She flat out forgot.\n\nThe shwarma itself was pretty good. It was my first time trying it. It looked a bit different than what I had seen elsewhere, but it's not a big deal. I definitely want to try some other varieties. The basboosa (semolina cake?) was good... thick and syrupy. It had an interesting texture... a lot like cornmeal. The tea was alright, but I thought it was a bit over priced for the small cup. But I do know chai costs a bit more. Now for the napolean... I waited maybe an hour and half to eat it. And the top layer was so hard it bent up my plastic fork. I had to really let it sit in my hot kitchen for a couple of hours for it to soften up. When it finally did I really liked it, but it was mushed up from earlier. Did they give it to me frozen? What if I wanted to eat it right away?\n\nAlso, there were indeed paper towels in the bathroom this time. Other than that, a couple brought their dogs to the outdoor patio. I didn't appreciate that at all. Period. Not to mention some woman parked her double baby stroller in front of the patio doors and walked away. On the plus side, there was a shift change while I was eating so when I returned my dishes the new cashier was MUCH friendlier and much less awkward.", "date": "2014-05-15 18:47:31", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 276, "average_stars": 3.34, "yelping_since": "2010-05-22 13:28:37"}}

Honestly, I really felt Manakeesh was lacking on almost all fronts. \n\nI'll start with some positives.  This place is clean (front of house, at least).  Things are organized and there does seem to be a sense of calm.  The girl at the cashier was nice.  Very hospitable.  Cute, too.\n\nI got the schwarma because I thought it would be a nice introduction, culinarily, to the restaurant.  There are a lot of places in the immediate area doing schwarmas.  Obviously, you have to make it really good if you want it to stand out, right?  \n\nManakeesh's interpretation of a schwarma is a pretty bad.  The \"marinated sirloin strips\" was actually more like coarsely ground beef.  It had a most bizarre texture.  There was also a problem with the flavor - there was none.  I don't think they use any salt in their cooking.  Very bland.  No soulfulness.  No deep flavors I've come to expect from true middle eastern eateries.  \n\nThe \"garnish\" of the schwarma were some bitter white onions and some slimey tomatoes that looked like they had been cut last weekend.  I guess the parsley was a nice touch, but it was too little too late.  \n\nAs for the flatbread, there was no life to it.  I had the sense that no cook there had given the dough the love it so badly needs.  Also, the dough was still a little raw on the inside.  \n\nI could really only stomach about half a sandwich.  Every bite just got progressively worse.  I was waiting for that bite where everything made sense.  \n\nI had made the mistake of ordering the \"cheesecake\" while I ordered the sandwich, so that's how I was gonna finish the meal.  This \"cheesecake\" was unlike any cheesecake I've ever had before.  The texture was that of a six month old tasty cake.  WAY too sweet.  Not soft, rich and luscious how I know my cheesecakes to be.

I live in Rittenhouse, and if I could change anything, I would transport Manakeesh to my neighborhood. \n\nI've gone with my boyfriend and brother both times, and both times we each got a Manakeesh (lebanese flatbread sandwich), so I've tried most of the meat varieties. My favorites were the Sujuk (which is ground meat) and Tawook (marinated chicken with a delicious yogurt sauce). Lahm Bajeen and Kafta were also really excellent, and Shaved Prime Rib was good, but not nearly as good as the others. The flatbread is so delicious. It is light, crunchy and fluffy. Like an amazing thin fresh pita. If you like things spicy, add a little sriracha. I haven't tried the vegetarian options, but I can't imagine anything on these delicious breads being bad. There is even a nutella one. \n\nEat in if you can.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the employees are great and hospitable.  You order at the register, and they give you a number to bring to your table. A very short wait later (considering they make the flatbread fresh!), the nicest lady ever brings your food to the table. If you must take out, eat at home because this is table food - some of the meat ones are kind of greasy in a delicious gyro sort of way.\n\nThis place is extremely cheap too. The meat manakeesh range in price from $4-$5 (except the shaved prime rib and you should skip that one anyway), and they are really filling. Both my brother and boyfriend were full from eating one, and I could hardly finish mine. It's a great deal.\n\nThere are a variety of desserts. I've tried a few types of baklavah, which run about a dollar a piece for a 2-bite piece, which is a very decent price and the perfect size after a filling manakeesh. All the types I've tried were good, but not amazing. I'm a little confused by all the other desserts though bc they are not well labeled.

Labanese pizza?!  I love love LOVE pizza, so I was intrigued. \n\nOrdered the Lamb Lahm Bajeen Manakeesh, Spinach and Cheese Manakeesh, and the Gluten Free Platter that comes with hummus, baba ghannoush, falafel, fattoush, and grape leaves.\n\nDelivery was faster than expected which was an awesome surprise since I was starving.  The estimated delivery time was about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes, but delivery arrived around 45 mins.  Awesome!\n\nNow this is where they lose stars.  They deliver their flatbreads, folded in half.  So it's more like a quesadilla than a pizza.  I would recommend that maybe they could invest in some recyclable pizza boxes for their Manakeesh items, so these could be delivered flat.  I was able to unfold the lamb one, but the spinach and cheese was a fail because all the toppings ended up on one side.  Definitely disappointed by this.\n\nI did like the flavors/spices in the lamb.  The spinach and cheese was nothing spectacular to report.  Also, the platter was pretty standard.  I've definitely had better falafel and I had to reheat them since all the other items of the platter were cold which made the falafel arrive cold as well.  Enjoyed the baba ghannoush and the stuffed grape leaves. \n\nAll in all, I would have rather ordered an amazing pizza from somewhere else and be more content with that, then with what I've sampled from here, especially if you compare that with the money that was spent on the above.  \nI won't be ordering delivery again, but would be up to  going and having a sit-down meal at this spot.", "date": "2015-03-31 15:25:55", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 241, "average_stars": 4.08, "yelping_since": "2010-02-20 21:50:54"}}

The salad was ok, the hummus ok, and the large portion of basmati rice really dwarfed the meat even further. The portion of beef was significantly less than the chicken. It was somewhat funny that my boyfriend and I sat picking at the chicken, thinking it was beef, until the beef came out. The beef had a tangy, vinegary flavor. I really did not like either.

A Yelp search brought me to Manakeesh Cafe & Bakery, and although its location is quite out of the way, my yoga classes on the weekend bring me far enough into the area that I decided to make a side trip there before heading home. \n\nThe large cafe and bakery is designed so that it looks like two different sections/businesses, with the cafe on one side and the dessert-y, smoothie, ice cream bar area on the other. I quickly spotted the sweets I was after since they are displayed right at the cafe's counter, and after a bit of a wait since this is a popular place, I ordered almost one of every single type of baklava and sweet that I saw. It was quite a large order, but we were having friends over so I figured it was safer to get more and then people can choose what to eat (and I would get the leftovers ;D). Our little party had fun trying things (I was shocked that someone had never had baklava before!):\n\nSemolina cake: this almond semolina cake was very dense and sweet, especially with the sweet sugar syrup that's poured on top. The almond flavor is very light and complements the semolina perfectly.\nPhyllo sweet cheese pastry (can't remember the name of it): yummy! The shredded phyllo itself was not very sweet, but it adds a great crunch, and the sweet cheese filling was delicious. The piece they cut was topped with a dollop of more of the filling with pistachio pieces on top.\nMalmouls: the pistachio one had a mellow toasted pistachio filling, and the semolina shortbread was still a bit moist and corn cookie-like. The sweet date filled one was delicious, too. The walnut one had a very pronounced toasted walnut flavor - it was so good, it might be my favorite, and I had assumed pistachio would be since I love that little green nut so much...\nAssorted baklava: these were absolutely delicious, not soaked in honey the way most baklava you encounter is, and the phyllo dough is super light, flaky, and buttery. All of the different toasted nuts were finely ground and held their own flavor against the sweet honey. Some of the best baklava I've ever had.

So that you can reduce the awkwardness of staring above the head of the guy at the counter, they have printed menus available. The cashier was also very helpful for suggesting what we might want to eat. I went with Lauren S, and on her recommendation we decided to share hummus, the shawarma manakeesh, and the honey manakeesh. The shawarma manakeesh was the least exciting of the things we received - it was fine, but not exciting enough that I would order it again. But oh my goodness was everything else delicious. The hummus had great flavor - almost a little lemony. The small was the perfect size to share among the two of us and was served with warm flatbread. I knew we still had 2 flatbreads to go but could not stop eating this. The honey manakeesh was delicious. I would seriously eat this for any meal - breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, 2am drunk food, whatever. It is delicious sweet cream and honey wrapped in warm flatbread and I want to ask it to marry me. \n\nAfter all of that, we still managed to find room for dessert ... rather, about 6 desserts.

The owner very patiently answered every single one of our questions, which all boiled down to, \"What is this? What does it taste like? Do we want to eat it? Do we want to eat it more than the thing you just told us about which sounded delicious?\" Because we have no impulse control we basically ordered everything that looked good. It was all delicious. I couldn't tell you what everything was called so just point at whatever strikes your fancy and eat it, you won't go wrong. \n\nI have to mention that one of the highlights of our meal was the owner's son - who looks to be around 9 years old and was helping serve food when we visited. He was absolutely charming and helpful, bringing us our food, checking to make sure we didn't need anything, and happily discussing dinner and dessert choices with us. It was a pleasure to see that the whole family is involved in this family restaurant!", "date": "2012-01-16 03:09:27", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 347, "average_stars": 3.96, "yelping_since": "2010-11-23 03:14:25"}}

I really wanted to give them a chance considering how popular they are in Philly.\n\nThe last time we were there, my family and I came over for dinner and we decided that each of us was going to order something different on the menu. In the end, we ordered Kafta Kebab, Chicken Tawook, Chicken Shawarma, and the Beef Shawarma. We also ordered a cheese and a zaatar manakeesh.\n\nThere seemed to be an event going on that day because It was pretty packed. We suffered through the long line until it was time to order. I appreciated the fact that they let me know ahead of time the wait time for the food was going to be about 45 mins. Nonetheless, I was impressed that they were able to get the food out 30 mins later.\n\nNow the food. Both of the shawarmas were terrible. The meat was dry, and the lamb specifically tasted like it was made out of rubber. The Chicken Tawook and the Kafta were pretty good, though I've had better. \n\nWe also had some Muhammara and Baba Ghanouj with our platters. Being a baba fanatic, I would say their Baba was not bad at all. It was a good balance between the smokey flavor and the eggplant. The Muhammara, though, was just awful and did not taste like traditional Muhammara at all. Word of advice: if a place isn't run by Syrians, don't bother trying the Muhammara. \n\nBut I will say this: their Manakeesh was probably the best thing we had on the menu. And the pitas that were served with the food did really taste like it was baked fresh. Knowing they consider themselves a bakery, I would have been heavily disappointed if their Manakeesh didn't live up to their name.\n\nAnd finally the Knafeh I had for dessert. It seemed that they had taken it out of the oven and left it out in the open for a long period of time because it was cold. Nonetheless, it wasn't bad.\n\nSo would I come back another time? Maybe. I just wouldn't order anything from a grill: kebabs, shawarmas.  My overall opinion is that you should try out the things that they actually do best in:  The Manakeesh !:)", "date": "2019-02-08 15:56:33", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 13, "average_stars": 4.43, "yelping_since": "2014-08-30 19:13:57"}}

I'd been stalking you on Facebook and Yelp, ogling your flatbread sandwiches and exotic sweets. Yesterday afternoon, when I saw a \"now deal\" on Groupon, I decided that the day had finally come to taste your Lebanese wonders. So I grabbed the groupon and a good friend, and I headed across the river to West Philly.\n\nThey have two outdoor seating areas: one in the front, as well as a patio on the side. The interior is open and airy (the building was formerly a bank), with Arabic designs decorating the exposed brick walls. They really did a great job with the space. It's lovely and welcoming.\n\nFrom the equally welcoming staff, I ordered the following:\n\n-Veggie manakeesh: possibly my favorite of the manakeesh...es.\n\n-Lahm bajeen manakeesh: ground beef with tomato; second favorite. This one and the veggie would be good ones to try first if you're new to this type of food, because they have familiar flavors.\n\n-Kafta manakeesh: ground beef with lamb and parsley. For me, this one fell under the \"glad I tried it, but wouldn't necessarily order it again\" category.\n\n-Honey manakeesh: this, presumably because of the liquid-y nature of the toppings, came wrapped up instead of flat. It's basically a hoagie-shaped wrap of fluffy bread filled with honey and \"sweet cream\" (tasted similar to ricotta) that you eat like a giant sandwich, while getting honey freakin' everywhere, like a slob. (Or that might just be me.) My Iraqi friend tells me that back home, this was a standard breakfast for him. I can confirm that it makes a lovely accompaniment to one's morning tea, because I had my leftover half this morning. The honey provides just enough sweetness without pushing it all the way into dessert territory. (They use raw honey, as well.) Love!\n\n-Sfeeha: mini meat pie, which you can order individually or by the half-dozen/dozen. Adorable and delicious.\n\n-Fatayer: mini spinach pie. Same deal as above; almost as adorable and delicious.\n\n-Some type of sweet cake that I cannot remember the name of.\n\n-pot of tea, which is served in a stainless steel footed teapot on a tray with two small glasses, one mint leaf in each. (Completely irrelevant aside regarding handle-less teacups: After burning my hand on many a piping-hot cup of tea in my day, I often absentmindedly wondered why the Asians and Arabs, who drink so much tea, never embraced the whole \"teacup with a handle\" idea. But now it occurs to me... if it's too hot to touch, it's probably too hot to drink. Hm. Makes a lot of sense, actually.)\n\nSo I had quite the mid-east feast on my first visit, but there is still a ton of stuff I want to try. (Nutella manakeesh with banana and hazelnut shavings?! Want/need.) I've made it a personal mission to sample the entire menu.\n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, I could easily spend all day here studying (they have wifi), sipping tea, and snacking on savory sfeehas.", "date": "2011-09-29 19:00:10", "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 46, "average_stars": 3.79, "yelping_since": "2011-07-20 05:07:50"}}

I must say, it's very cool. There were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, but I feel some potential here so I'm going to give it another go... sooner than you think.\n\nI ordered the Sujuk (sandwich) because some yelper below spoke highly of it and because I rarely order sausage while I'm out. I got a couple of honey glazed things. One looked like silly puddy molded into a baby pine cone. It had an interesting taste... really sweet. I'm not sure I liked it that much for a dollar. I also tried a chewy near eastern yet distant relative of the funnel cake and that was pretty good. For a dollar, I would've preferred a bit more heft in it.\n\nOk, so to the Sujuk! I placed my order, paid up, and went to wash my hands. STRIKE 1: The bathroom was nice, but with no paper towels I wasn't a happy camper. So then I came out and my food was being delivered to the territory I staked my life on over in the corner. I got a cup and proceeded to the open air fountain. No matter what kind of food a restaurant is selling... having free refills is \"first base\" as far as I'm concerned. And the drinks were of the Pepsi persuasion.\n\nNo really, to the Sujuk! The spice on it opened my nose up and it tasted pretty good, but I'm thinking... something is missing here and I don't know what it is. STRIKE 2: They didn't ask me what I wanted on it! I could've gotten all sorts of veggies and sauces or whatever. I just made do with sriracha at the counter since I ate half of it before I figured something was up. (the other option was ketchup)\n\nThis would be strike 3 if it happened to me, but it was someone else. They have an impressive outdoor seating area and the couple was out there doing their thing and they got locked out! No one let them in. They exited from the outside and didn't bother coming back in. That's not a good look.\n\nOverall, I like the place. I'm going to have to try another \"sandwich\" (Kafta) with some \"stuff\" on it. I also want to grab some chai and setup a mobile office some time. Very cool addition to West Philly.

Why three times, instead of my usual pre-review requirement of two? Well...in spite of all the other adoring reviews, and in spite of the fact that Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite, I just wasn't having great luck with my orders, until this past Friday. \nSo let's start with the best, and work back to most disappointing;\nOn Friday I ordered a grape leaves wrap for dinner. I knew that I really liked their stuffed grape leaves (or, as known by their Greek name, dolmades) and how can you go wrong with fattoush salad (hold the onions!) and baba ghanoush? Well, they forgot to hold the onions, but they did call me not 5 minutes after my pick-up to apologize and offer to replace the whole meal. I told them not to worry, and I was glad I did (the onions were few and easy to pick out anyway). It was a really great wrap, and a perfect portion. Flavorful and filling, but not too much so. My partner got the falafel platter, which he really liked, but the massive hummus portion packs a punch - you might not want to finish it in a single sitting. \nSo I knew I liked the stuffed grape leaves thanks to the ma'ali platter. That was from visit number two. Sadly, that was the only thing I completely enjoyed from that meal (which I shared with my partner, together with a cheese manakeesh). The fried cauliflower, eggplant and potatoes were tasty enough, but so loaded down with oil that I really didn't feel great soon after. As for the cheese manakeesh...I just don't get it. What am I missing?\nMy first visit was the biggest disappointment. I ordered the cheese and spinach manakeesh. The spinach was so briny I could barely eat it. I guess I was expecting a more Greek-style cheese-spinach blend, and this was not that. I mean, I love pickled cucumbers, but Manakeedh goes super heavy on vinegar and pickled foods, at least on everything I've had.\nNot the most glowing review, and it really feels more like 3.5 than 4 stars, but I gave the full 4 because the service is great, very quick, friendly and mindful, and everyone else I've gone with has really enjoyed their food. I'm really tempted to try one of their vegetarian savory crepes, but I'm not sure yet if there will be a fourth visit.

He basically could care less.

Once paid you will get a number to place on your table. With this number system I'm not sure if it was for the staff to bring you your food or for you to pickup once your food is ready. I saw both scenarios happening when I was there. \n\nThe menu:\n-The menu is substantive and has many options for different dietary restrictions. \n-There are a few parts of the menu which are confusing since they seem similar with other menu items, however the person behind the counter was able to clarify easily for us. \n-We noticed this after, but there is a printed menu available at the counter, not only the one above the counter as we had thought.\n-There is signage at the counter indicating that due to rising costs, all prices will be increased by 5% from what is stated. However checking in on Yelp yields a 5% off purchase coupon.\n\nFood:\n-The portions are huge and easily shared\n-The pita is made to order and very delicious \n-Everyone in the group enjoyed their order.\n-The bakery's menu looked delicious but sadly most items were out of stock. \n\nWith all the positives listed above, you may be wondering why the three star review.  The bathroom was absolutely filthy and disgusting. I am hoping it's due to a fluke but it was bad enough to dock a star. Upon future visits If the situation improves I will update my review. \n\nAdditionally the whole numbering system is frankly confusing. Some of us had our food brought to us. Others had to keep looking at the area where food that was ready to see if our order was there.  The restaurant was not busy so we were unsure what the deal was. This resulted in loss of a star since the last person in our group to get their food, where the rest of the group was already midway through theirs. This resulted in the loss of another star. \n\nOverall I would give Manakeesh another chance and also would love to try their bakery. I hope they take the feedback and address it. \n\nThings to know:\n-It will be easier to look and order off printed menu versus one displayed above counter\n-Indoor and outdoor seating available\n-Pay attention to food that is ready to be served, your order may be stuck there if you are waiting for it to be brought to you \n-Guest WiFi available \n-Come prepared with hand sanitizer to wash your hands versus using the bathroom. And do your best to avoid having to use the restaurant restroom. You will thank me later. \n-Cutlery, napkins, and water are self served.  However the water cups are TINY (like 4 sips) so be prepared to refill often or (what I recommend) bring your own refillable water bottle/cup. \n-Street parking only\n-There is a small section stocked with different items such as honey, Turkish delight, nuts, candy, etc. \n-Manakeesh has their own app for you to place delivery orders and get discounts from", "date": "2021-06-26 12:37:04", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 71, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-05-04 22:47:11"}}

The decor is better than the worthy competitor of fellow Lebanese competitor Saad's (across the street). I usually order the Lebanese Beef platter w muhammarah  Nd the fatoosh salad. Yesterday I ordered the shish tawook platter for variety and my dining partner ordered the Beef. Our platters and Pepsis cost just over $40 w tax. After a few minutes, yhe platters came out and we were politely told by a diminutive, bearded cashier, the pita would follow. The pita did not follow. When asked about the pita 10-15 minutes and waiting in live for the privilege to again speak to said diminutive cashier, the cashier acted as though he had never seen me. I remarked that if platters cost $20 with a drink, they should include pita. He reaponded woth a blank stare. O returned to my seat and waited for the pita. None came. The cashier pretended he could not see me as I stared it him in astonishement. I returned to the cashier, dining room and rush completely. No excise for bad service at this point and the platters empty. My dining partner looking at warm babaganoush. I again inquired aboit the pita. Again a blank stare. I requested to speak to the manager. The cashier yhen remarked \"GOOD! Easier for me!  After another ten minutes the manager came out. A young man in his twenties w red hair. Polite. He explained that the cashier \"did not understand...\"thought you had left\"and was \"new in the country\". Perhaps he should not deal with paying customers in that case. I returned to me seat to see if Manakeesh jas any management integrity. They do. Finally after about a total of an hour i was offered pita to go in bag. By then, the $40 lunch for two was OVER and I was simply seeking some sort of satisfaction re the poor service from the cashier. Instated that I had no interest in pita at that point. I was offered some baklava which was a decent attempt to appease. I declined stating that I was not seeking a freebie, that I had come expecting the usual great food and acceptable service and been disappointed. I would give 3.5 stars if it were an option. \n\nA twenty dollar platter for lunch should come with a PITA. At the TIME IT IS SERVED.

While one of the chefs was wearing a mask during our visit, the other one was putting his mask on and off every time he wants to talk, laugh, or interact with the cashier. Which defeats the purpose of the mask. Everyone that was coming out from the back kitchen was not wearing a mask either. They had a ceramic wrap on the counter which is a very poor attempt at having some sort of shield (similar to what you see at grocery stores) since it would not even reach the hight of any average-sized human. The purpose of covering the counter area is to protect both workers and customers, having this wrap way below one's head where anything coming from your mouth will easily land on the other side is pointless. Lastly, the person responsible for bagging the food was constantly touching his face and hair while bagging everything. \nIf you care for your safety I would not recommend this place, especially during this pandemic.
