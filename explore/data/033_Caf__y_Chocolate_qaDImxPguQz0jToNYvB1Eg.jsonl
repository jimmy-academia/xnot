We were so excited to try CCC and finally had brunch there today. 3 adults and 3 kids. We ordered several dishes as well as the famed ccc. The place was less than half full yet our wait for food was surprisingly long. After about 20 mins, the server seemed apologetic and offered us an appetizer as we waited, we accepted (stay tuned for more on that later). The app was toasted bread with a refried type black bean paste and cheese melted on top, it was good, not great but the kids liked it. About 5 mins after that came the tamale dish of one adult at the table, no one else's food was in sight. She liked her dish. Next came nachos: as another Yelper stated, it was good but with too many cold components to make it great. It seemed each dish came out within 10 mins of the one before... My husbands migas especial came and he, who has NEVER in all the years I've known him, not eaten what he's ordered, did just that today... He just did not like the soupiness not the flavor of the dish...total surprise to me. So we are 45 minutes into this meal and 3 kids have still not received the 3 chicken tacos they ordered and I did not get my dish. I got up and politely asked the server if we could cancel those orders as the rest of the table was already done. I asked why there had been such a delay (btw, I speak fluent Spanish so there was definitely no issue with understanding one another). The server just apologized and agreed that small kids should usually be the first to get fed (especially really you g ones, since otherwise you'll have a nacho chip throwing mutiny). She gave us the bill and guess what, she charged us $6.50 for the appetizer she offered us what seemed to be a co cession for the delay.

Always while heading in the opposite direction.  Well today I discovered what I've been missing, great Mexican food west of the Italian Market area.  \n\nAfter a late night of perhaps a little too much to drink, I stumbled out of the house in search of something good to eat and decided now was as good a time as any to explore the culinary offerings of my new neighborhood. Well I got about half a block before coming to cafe con chocolate.  I approached to find that this was more than just a coffee shop but a Mexican/Japanese fusion restaurant.  I had to check it out.\n\nOnce inside I discovered that the menu was mostly Mexican.  There weren't many Japanese offerings but other options abounded.  Upon the recommendation of another customer, I ordered the enchiladas with pork and a side order of the home fries, which were touted on the board outside the restaurant.  The enchiladas came covered in a delicious salsa verde with a side of rice and refried beans.  Everything was wonderful.  The pork was tender and well flavored and was complemented perfectly by the salsa.  The potatoes came out piping hot but once cool I found them to be well flavored and with a great texture.  They were nice and crisp on the outside and tender but firm on the inside.  They also were great when dipped in the salsa.  I wish I had more room in my stomach.  \n\nThe staff was friendly as well as the clientele.  The decor was warm and there was great art on sale.  My only complaint is that this place is not open more.  They are not open Mon-Wed and don't open until 10 am the other days.  I could see myself getting breakfast here most mornings.

Methinks not\" sums up our experience quite well.\n\nI can and can not believe all of the raving reviews for this restaurant, alas, we had a horrid experience! \n \nWe had tickets to see Rain at 1:00 and decided to check out Cafe con Chocolate for brunch, which is basically Mexican cuisine, although they do have a small selection of Japanese, imagine fusion of a Mexican and Japanese menu...\n \nThe place is tiny, with probably ten to twelve small tables all pushed together and they were all either seated or dirty when we walked in, so we chose to seat ourselves at the counter, which had six stools. The restaurant is colorful with bright walls, decorated with paintings that are for sale and shelves holding both Mexican and Japanese pieces. The floors are old and unfinished wood, which even have knot holes allowing the light from the basement to shine through. \n \nThey do their own baking, as I witnessed the cook putting up trays of cookies and baked goods, while also preparing folks meals.\n \nThe dirty dishes get scraped and piled up into the hand washing sink behind the counter or stacked on the counter still loaded with uneaten food. The kitchen is off to the right with a queer set up, there is a board that the food is set on to be delivered to the tables, yet when the server walks into the kitchen, she must duck under this board and then immediately go down one step.\n \nI will give our server five bright and shiny stars, how she did it, I will never know. First of all they offer a huge variety of coffee drinks, chocolate drinks, including mochas, smoothies, fruit drinks. She had a memory like none I have ever witnessed and as tables came in, she would take their order, take it to the kitchen and then make drinks, which took her quite some time and if another table came in, she would then take their order and go back to making drinks for that first table. Expect your beverages to take 15 to 30 minutes!\n \nWe walked in at 11:30, ordered at 11:45, we got our food at 12:45, well not quite, as it sat on the board for a good five minutes until we finally stopped her and said our food has been sitting there, we're hungry, we have a 1:00 play and it is getting cold. One server, who kept apologizing, she was doing her very best, including take out orders for drinks and food. Until that point, we kept saying it was okay, no worries, but at that point we had enough.\n \nI ordered the molletes, which I had never had before and they sounded interesting. Two long buttered rolls with a layer of black beans, cheese and a bowl of very good Pico de gallo was served on the side. I had added chorizo and over easy eggs to top the molletes. I made it a point to tell her that I liked my whites cooked but my yolks completely runny. \n \nWell my eggs came out over hard, no runny yolk whatsoever. I showed her that the yolks were hard and she was planning on taking the plate back and I said no, we have to leave, just bring me two more eggs cooked properly. I wasn't the only table who sent back food, even though I held onto mine like it was gold. The eggs came right out, I ate half of one molletes, the eggs and packaged the rest to go.\n\nTo make matters worse there was no chorizo on the molletes, but at this point I didn't even care! We were still charged for it, getting your check takes another 5-10 minutes, as she then adds up everything that you ordered. Rather than argue we paid for the sausage, since our play, which was across town, had already started. \n \nMichael ordered the enchiladas, of which you had your choice of fillings, he ordered ground beef, etc., and your choice of mole sauce or a green salsa Verde, he chose the mole and got the salsa. It was also to come with a side of beans and rice. Now if you want to take a look at the other posters pictures, we had envisioned Spanish rice and refried pinto beans, the black beans were great, but the rice? It was plain white rice, totally unseasoned, I mean totally and had corn stirred in? Which looked nothing like this picture http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qaDImxPguQz0jToNYvB1Eg?select=59lHgE8PVzkzrLrV3iGtvQ\n \nPortions are all huge and I enjoyed watching all of the food that came out of the kitchen. I watched as the owner/manager? Walked in right before we left and start to clean up the tables and dishes. One cook, one server on a very busy Sunday morning, maybe he should hire more help or come in quite a bit earlier. \n \nIt's not located in the best section of the city, debris and litter everywhere and many folks who looked like they could be trouble.

The lady working at the counter is this super-sweet girl who provided excellent service. Don't get me started on the traditional Mexican coffees/drinks and desserts!!!\n\nI got the Iced Blue Amaze and my friend got the Iced Cafe Con Chocolate, and both were delish! The blue amaze is a shot of espresso blended with ice, honey, cream, and this corn maize substance. I know - it sound strange, but the heartiness of the corn added an extra dimension to balance out the cream and espresso. The Cafe Con Chocolate had a rich chocolate base that brought out some of the coffee-espresso flavors, wrapped in some cinnamon. These drinks were so unique and ethnic (plus iced on a hot day) - perfect!!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the desserts - These are the BEST CHURROS I ever tasted, and really delicious Tres Leches cake. The churros were perfecttttt!!! They came out hot and piping with a careful blanket of sugar over. The churros is crispy on the outside and creates a gradient of crispy to soft/gooey in the center. Omgggg, sooo good! The center is so soft and delectably doughy, it melts in your mouth. Amazing!! I have to try the caramel ones next time. The chocolate sauce on the side was very light and liquid, not very rich. This actually worked perfectly because it let the churros truly shine, lightly flavored with cinnamon-chocolate.\n\nThe Tres Leches was also tres delicious!!! The cake was airy, light and fluffy, soaking up the condensed milk and cream at the bottom. It reminds me of how lady fingers soak up coffee in a well-crafted tiramisu. The beauty was the cake truly was light and took in the three creams, creating an almost cheesecake-like texture. The magic was that the cake was not soggy, but rather fluffed up from the cream.

But I'll come back to that...\nWe went at 7 on a Saturday night and there was only one other couple there. There are small round tables for two, a homespun sort of feel in the \"decor\" with just-right lighting. A young woman behind the counter was super-nice and genuinely glad to see us. \nWe ordered tacos with potatoes and nopales (cactus) - i know it sounds crazy - and a pork torta (hot sandwich). They came in plastic baskets. And the tacos were AMAZING! incredibly flavorful, just the right amount of heat. I could eat them every day and be happy. The torta was excellent too, but less interesting. It was large and loaded with pork, but not in that deli too-much-meat-in-a-sandwich way. The bread was deliciously crusty. \nThe staff was absolutely charming. The cook came out and asked how the food was, not to be impressive like you get at upscale restaurants, but because she really wanted to know. She asked if it was the first time i'd had nopales (it was) and was obviously pleased at how much i liked them. It felt as though we were at a friend's house for dinner the first time and they really wanted us to like it.\nWe finished off with a cafe on chocolate - really hot chocolate.

Given the location, I was hardly surprised. So I grabbed a seat at the rear, and took a look at the menu. Tap water sans ice was immediately brought over, but there was no coffee order taken. Considering there were two employees working front of house and (including my table and the previously mentioned) a total of four customers, I was hoping to receive some coffee quickly. This is one of the first things ALL breakfast/brunch places should consider top priority. When people are awake on the weekend, they like to be caffeinated. I understand this is not universal, but for the brunch crowd it is pretty standard. So the waitress proceeds to not come over for about ten more minutes, while I scour the menu. All the while, listening to a strange smooth jazz play list of contemporary covers, and watching a computer monitor slideshow of said waitress on a trip somewhere. Two more people showed up, and I was worried all was lost. Would coffee even be an option now that there were six customers?\n\n\nWell the coffee did come, however the order was taken with the food order. One Cafe con Chocolate (coffee with chocolate) and one black coffee, which took the same amount of time to get to us as the food. A huge issue for me. On a rainy day (or any day) when I am at brunch, I want to be sipping my beverage while waiting for my food. I would understand if they were backed up at the barista counter, but they were not. It was a huge disappointment. \n\nSo the food came, along with the coffee, which was now too hot to drink until after I finished my torta. Oh yea, I ordered the chorizo and egg torta. It came on a crusty loaf of bread, and was HUGE. The ingredients were all tasty and included, sour cream and beans on one side of the bread, with chipotle mustard dip on the other. Packed in between was queso fresco, mozzarella cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion, and avocado, along with the aforementioned chorizo and eggs. The eggs were moist and not over cooked, and the flavors were all there. I wish the chorizo had more bite/spice, as it was quite mild. Overall, this was a pretty great breakfast torta. It was hardly authentic, but it was good, and at $8, a generous portion. \n\nMy dining mate decided to be a bit more ambitious, and tried the huevos ahogados. It consisted of two eggs poached in salsa verde, with a side of refried beans, and chorizo was added to the order. On paper it sounded like it had potential (although I was skeptical), however in reality, it turned out to be a big flop. The dish lacked any kind of contrast of textures. It was basically a big bowl of warm salsa, with two poached eggs, some mashed beans, and chorizo. Everything in it was soft or chewy. It would have been a completely different story if there were some tortillas, or more reasonably, some chips served on the side. Or, perhaps even a spoon! Alas, there were none of the above, and the waitress then disappeared for about fifteen more minutes, and there was no longer any point. The flavor  was there in this dish, but the execution  was completely off point. There was no way to eat it, and the fork was very little help. It was a bowl of mush.\n\nI like the idea of Snyder Ave. getting some love and offering something interesting besides the sadness that occupies most of the avenue west of Broad, but unfortunately, Cafe con Chocolate needs some work.

It's MASSIVE and so incredibly tasty. I split it with a friend and we were stuffed after each having just 1/2 the sandwich.\n+Molletes with Pico De Gallo... delicious. A popular item again, and it was a fabulous way for us to start the meal. The cheese is melty, and topped with the pico... drooling now thinking about it.\n+The churros are tasty for people who haven't had that many churros in their lifetime, and they come with some fun dipping sauces-- but if you are a HARDCORE churro lover and have had some amazing (i.e. more authentic ones) in the past, I'd skip them. There are other menu items that are better!\n+The hot chocolate is absolutely amazing. Please don't leave without trying it. I've tried the Cafe con Chocolate drink, the Oaxaca, and the frozen hot chocolate drink. All were amazing.\n\nI'd definitely try to make a trip down here. The menu is flooded with dishes that sound amazing, and I can speak to the fact that they are executed wonderfully as well. I really am looking forward to trying more of their drinks, desserts, and dishes (namely the burritos!)", "date": "2015-05-23 04:34:00", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 518, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2013-11-08 18:02:33"}}

I didn't think the food was as affordable as some reviewed because after adding meat, my entree was close to $15 which in my opinion is comparable to most Mexican restaurants.   My drink was about $5.   I have to say I have had far better Mexican foods else where and am really not sure why this place is raved as one of the best brunches of Philly.   Our food was about a 3 out of 5, service the same, and the drinks were a 5 out of 5.  I would give the restaurant a 3.5 out of 5.  Rice was a bit soggy, meal came out lukewarm to cold, and the service was just okay.  Refills were slow and there seemed to a communication breakdown between servers.    The very serious stoic person behind making drinks seemed very serious and maybe the owner or manager and gotta say her drinks were amazing.   I added steak to my enchiladas and the steak was rubbery and lukewarm.

I was part of a party of 9 and seating wasn't an issue (though it should be noted that we called ahead...we arrived at 11:30am on Saturday and all of the seats had filled by 12:30pm, so don't be surprised to see a wait around prime brunch time). I ordered the Chocolate Oaxaca to start and it was delicious. The drink wasn't too sweet and had a very rich chocolate flavor. Best of all they had a variety of non-dairy milks available for the drinks (almond, coconut, and soy).\n\nUnfortunately, the meal did not live up to the drink. I ordered the Enchiladas Verdes with chicken. The first issue was that my food was pretty much cold. I wasn't the only one who experienced this, as another person at the table who also ordered enchiladas said her food was just below room temperature. In addition to the lack of heat, the dish also lacked flavor---I had to douse my entire dish in hot sauce to add some semblance of salt. Lastly, the enchiladas were completely swimming in the green sauce. There were times when I wasn't sure if I was eating enchiladas or enchilada soup.\n\nOne note about the price: I think the $ rating is very deceiving. Everything is dirt cheap if you don't want meat. If you add meat you're looking at $15-ish per entree, which is pretty much the standard price you'd expect to pay at other Mexican restaurants.\n\nThe service was okay, nothing memorable (not bad, not exceptional). I will probably try this place another time with a different dish, but on the first go round it definitely did not live up to its reputation.", "date": "2019-02-10 16:56:55", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 74, "average_stars": 4.09, "yelping_since": "2014-04-06 16:46:37"}}

Was all the way back to our hotel when we found out so it was too late to do anything about it. The huarache was disappointing. It was more like a large taco. The huarache did not have any thickness to it. The beef seasoning and flavored was just off and I was off out by the peas and carrots cooked in the meat. The steak nachos were more like nachos with steak fajitas on top of them which consisted of a ton of bell peppers. Had we wanted fajitas we would have ordered them. The churros were good but considering we got the cajeta ones we would have expected more cajeta to be included. They did include a tiny cup of hot chocolate for dipping which I thought to be creative and cute.

While moderately deep in South Philly, the corner shop is only a block from the Broad and Snyder station. The restaurant stretches deep back into the narrow space. As you enter and walk up a couple of steps and past the coffee shop prep area. The warm-toned walls are decorated sparingly with artwork, including a series of ink portraits and a square charcoal still-frame. The fireplace and exposed-brick mantle are repurposed into a bookshelf complete with trinkets and merch. Pull-apart faux-wood tables are paired with standard black-framed chairs and wooden benches. Spanish classics play pleasantly in the background.\n\nWe began our late lunch with an Iced Mexican Mocha and Horchata. The mocha ran strong, packing two shots of espresso and balanced out with the spiced Oaxacan chocolate. The horchata maintained a strong cinnamon flavor with a subdued sweetness. For eats, with opted for a Chorizo Burrito and Molletes (open-faced Portuguese rolls topped with beans and cheese) with Carnitas. The burrito appeared unassuming upon its large serving plate, but the flour tortilla was generously filled, mostly with the meat and melty mozzarella (the lettuce and tomatoes were served atop the burrito instead of within). The chorizo was flavorful without being overwhelmingly greasy. Meanwhile, the molletes were served in a picturesque flower pattern, with a large mound of flavorful carnitas in the middle. The Portuguese roll was buttery and pillowy, while the rich queso Chihuahua was perfectly melty without becoming a liquid mess. Both entrees were well-complemented by three sauces (green, red, hot), all delicious. My favorite was the sweet, savory, and spicy red sauce.\n\nI felt right at home with the pleasant and attentive service. At $45 for brunch and beverages, Cafe y Chocolate seems a bit of a premium for Mexican fare, but a major steal among the Philly brunch scene.", "date": "2021-06-27 21:05:37", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 211, "average_stars": 4.08, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 22:23:33"}}

This review is based on four visits.  After my initial visit I was shouting about CCC from the rooftops, urging everyone I knew to go there, but now my opinion has changed and it's all based on the service the last 2 times I went there.\n\n\nFood: Every time I have been there it has been amazing.  I love the Mexican brunch so so much, I'm not sure which adjectives I can use to express it best.  I dream about this Mexican brunch regularly.  I love everything about it.  Six stars. (Yes, I know Yelp only goes up to five, but I choose six.)\n\nDrinks: I love the drink selection.  Everything is delicious.  The regular coffee, the iced coffee, the fruit shakes, and especially the signature drink, the Cafe Con Chocolate.  Try this, you haven't had mocha until you've tasted this one.  Six stars.\n\nSpace: I like the fact that it's in kind of a weird neighborhood that I otherwise would never go to.  It takes a lot for me to leave Northern Liberties.  If this place was in a trendy neighborhood, most likely I'd never go, because I wouldn't want to wait an hour to get a table.  The inside is cute and kind of reminds you of being in someone's house.  I like the fact that it's small with small tables. \n\nService: Ok, here it is.  THIS is the reason I have to give CCC a total rating of 2 stars.  The service on my last TWO visits was ZERO out of 5 stars.  On my first bad visit, we walked in and the restaurant was about half full.  There was a young Mexican waitress working.  No exaggeration - it took us FORTY FIVE MINUTES to even get our drinks.  I am not joking.  To add insult to injury, I ordered the cafe con chocolate and she served me cappuccino.  It took me an additional 5-10 minutes to get the drink I ordered.  The food came out about 10-15 minutes later.  I was RAVENOUS by the time my food came.  There was no excuse for these ridiculous delays as far as I could see.   \n\nI decided to give CCC the benefit of the doubt (anyone can have a bad day, right?) and went again a few weeks ago.  The time, if it's possible, the service was EVEN WORSE, which baffled me.  We walked in and were seated and there was only one other table of 2 people present.  It remained this empty for our entire stay.  Our drink and food orders were taken promptly by a middle aged, short, female server.  She was friendly and our drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time.  Then we waited, and waited, and......WAITED.  About 45 minutes after we got our drinks, the waitress came over and said \"ummm....you guys ordered already, right?\"   YES we ordered, 45 minutes ago.  She reconfirmed our order and walked over to the kitchen.  This lady OBVIOUSLY forgot to put in our order and left us sitting there 45 minutes after she originally took it and an hour after we walked in.  It then took an additional 20 minutes for our food to come out.  She FINALLY brought it out and at this point were were STARVING.  She made some lame unbelievable excuse that the kitchen had to \"make fresh beans\" for my dish.  This was not believable in any way.  Also totally unacceptable.  \n\nI hate to write this because I love CCC so much, besides the service.  I'd love for them to get it together service-wise so I can return to many more delicious brunches.

It was condensed and there was nothing Japanese on there anymore that I saw. There are a couple of new, larger tables to compliment the smaller ones. The messy computer station that took up eating space is gone. The wooden doorway food serving board is gone. The paint is fresh. The food came out quite a bit faster than in the past.

Don't expect them to bring your check when you are finished eating. They want you enjoy the time with your companions,  to feel at home there, and will bring the check once you ask for it.

The chocolate flavor really shines through the mole and yet maintains a nice spicy kick that delights. The cheese inside is firm and of good quality. It's not some greasy blob they try to hide. The beans are of the black variety and have full flavor. I wasn't as thrilled with my rice this time but I was full from the main part of the dish so I just moved it aside.\n\nOver all, this place is worth a visit.

She asking us if we were ready to place our order every few minutes and this happened three times. She was really nice about it though so I took it as a sign that she was just excited to serve us. \n\nAfter asking a couple questions, we were ready to order. I got the scrambled tofu, my friend had the chicken tinga empanadas, and we got an order of churros to share. We had the option of ordering plain churros or ones with caramel filling and decided to go all in and get the ones with caramel. \n\nThe scrambled tofu that I got was great. There was nothing special about it, but it was made well and was very filling. I was given a side of tortillas to create my own soft shell tacos which I enjoyed. My friend seemed to really like her entree and commented about how great the chicken tinga was. \n\nThe churros are what stood out the most though. They were absolutely amazing. They were warm, coated with cinnamon sugar, and had the most delicious caramel filling. They came with a homemade chocolate dipping sauce which I honestly didn't care much for. I was totally fine with the churros without the chocolate. They also came with fresh slices of strawberries and whipped cream on the side - I really liked that! No matter what you do, GET THE CHURROS. At only $4 for an order of six, you really can't go wrong. \n\nMy only complaint is that all of their entrees are savory, there are no sweet options. Of course there's the churros, but that isn't an entree. I would have loved to see some pancakes or waffles on the menu with some kind of Mexican twist. \n\nStill, Caf\u00e9 y Chocolate is a good option for brunch. I definitely want to try one of their hot beverages like a coffee or hot chocolate next time I visit.
