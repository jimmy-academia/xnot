They were extremely understanding of us being late to our reservation. We were immediately seated once we arrived and suggestions were made on what drinks to get. \n\nThe place is BYOB. We didn't know this so we were actually offered liquor on the house! I got the coconut chai lemonade with extra shots of vodka. It was mixed so well by Christian that I didn't even realize that I was drinking alcohol. \n\nFood (5 stars) \nEverything was just on point. And by that I mean the seasoning and presentation. We finished almost everything and by no means are the portion sizes small. It was that good. \n\nTo start we got the soup of the day and the crab cake. Let's just say I'll be dreaming about the crab cakes when I return to Chicago. Next we ordered the Ni\u00e7oise salad. The salmon was cooked to perfection, seriously, I am not over exaggerating. For entrees, I ordered the mussels and he got the seasonal flat iron steak with summer vegetables. Again, seasoning was perfect, not too salty and very palatable. I think there were over 40 mussels that came with my dish, which is something I've never seen before! \n\nService (5 stars) \nChristian and Kristin you both rock! Thank you for making our evening so memorable! The staff is extremely attentive and made every effort to make our experience as comfortable as possible. Empty plates and glasses were taken off of the table within 5 minutes. Plates and silverware were replenished after every course. I can honestly say that I've never had such a nice experience at such a low cost. Girard's is rare in that pleasant service is expected of the staff. Our bill came out with service included in the cost of each dish. I was so surprised because other restaurants that we have visited expect you to pay for service even if it is subpar. Let's just say I've never wanted to tip at a restaurant so badly. They definitely earned our gratitude. \n\nAll in all, there are so many great things to say about Girard's. If you are looking for a fantastic and intimate setting for your date, look no further than Girard's. \n\nP.S. I was so satisfied with the experience that I had to immediately write this review.

I am imagining them texting with that phone on the trolly right after holding the nasty rail.\n\nOther than hygiene however, I was impressed by the food. I wasn't blown away because it was trying to seem exotic but when you break down the dishes its kind of ordinary often inexpensive ingredients. The execution was on point though and they showed creativity in how the ingredients were paired. I liked the pistachio butter and banana sandwich the best. I was underwhelmed actually by the pistachio butter - i thought it would be more catchy - but the sandwich pulled it off by being fried and the bananas were fried too and there was a side of dipping syrup that was good. I also had the Quinoa for my main course and it was good but it couldve used more of the additives like poached egg or berries and less of the quinoa. My girlfriend had the eggs Benedict with salmon but it couldve used some pickled red onion on it.\n\nOverall a lot of just slightly missed marks.

The black and white ceiling was no substitute for decor.  Not a single flower.  So on to the food.  This is another BYOB (bring your own bread).  Nothing served with the soup.

Not a big deal, just technicalities. \n\nI came in for brunch with my boyfriend and sat outside.  I kind of got a diner vibe once I walked in the restaurant, however, make no mistake, the food was far from diner quality.  We started with the tomato gazpacho (morr puree than creamy but certainly was filled with flavor).  I normally dislike puree soup but this was really good. I had the smoked duck benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side while my bf had the country style breakfast with bacon, charred grapefruit. Ok, so I was actually expecting a thicker piece of duck than sliced beef like duck. However, it was overall very good without being too salty which is normally the reason why I don't like smoked salmon on my benedict.  Glad I got to try the duck version benedict.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the hike fries which were a fusion of being a chip but filled with potato filling. \nWe ended our meal with the banana granola coffee cake, served warm and moist. No complaints there. The granola were toasty and crunchy, loved it. \nOh for our drinks. We had the ice cafe Brulee (I thought was a little disappointing because it tasted like a cold brew) and coconut Chai lemonade (one word, INTERESTING but not my cup of tea).

I know there's been a lot of resistance/annoyance at their claim that \"tipping not necessary\" and I suspect that's the biggest issue they need to deal with.  Im not against it, though I believe the way the public and press anticipated it and translated it, some of the public just got angry.  I suppose that's a typical reaction from being confused. People don't like to be confused and the hype over Girard was inflated before it even opened.  \n\nLet's stay focused on the most important thing of all: THE FOOD.  The food is GREAT.\nI've had a great lunch there in January with a friend.  We over ordered and treated ourselves to a great lunch/brunch feast.  The service was really good and the kitchen was super.  Our food was spectacular and we left with a smaller bill than expected.  We tipped a lil on top of our bill because our server went out of her way for us which enhanced our meal.  \n\nThen, last night, I stopped in with a friend as we were looking for a last minute dinner destination along Girard ave.  I am so glad we did.  Sadly, the place was mostly empty.  I like that the interior is fresh and original.  Thanks Girard, for not looking and acting like every other place Ive been too.  The server was friendly and attentive.  We started with the Avocado Toast to share.  I have to admit, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The heaping serving of smashed avocado had spring peas and mint mixed in with drizzles of honey.  I wasn't prepared for the level of pleasure that evoked.  I love getting an inventive surprise and this was exactly that.\n\nMy friend had the half chicken piri piri, which was really tasteful and came on a large plate of saute'd vegetables.  It was a LOT of food.  My main course was the coffee-rubbed hanger steak. It  was cooked in a wine reduction and placed onto a delicious layer of mashed potatoes that seemed to have the slightest hint of truffle.  Im not sure but the entire dish was incredibly full of layers of flavor.   We split a dessert and that too was amazingly good.  Over all we had a very enjoyable dinner and the server dispelled confusion by his friendly mention that the bill he brought included tip already so we \"can pretend we're in Paris\".  Honestly the bill was too low for the quality of our meal so we bumped what we each paid up to $40 so that there was another 10-12% tip.  We did that so willingly because the food was just about perfect. In fact, the food was so good we had to double check the bill for a mistake because it was a lot lower than expected.  We often pay as much for less inventive food at gastropubs. \n\nI hope that the area continues to support them because this is a gem for the neighborhood and the city.  \n\nI'll be back.", "date": "2015-04-23 13:51:23", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 248, "average_stars": 3.85, "yelping_since": "2008-05-08 20:14:06"}}

After a few minutes driving around I was able to find street parking close to the restaurant. The space is open and clean, with yellow washed wood walls, wood floors and wood tables and white chairs. The ceiling has this funky white and black pattern.  The kitchen is open also and the place is not huge but still has a decent amount of tables. There was also some outdoor seating.\n\nThe service was outstanding. They were helpful with suggestions and always right there to fill water or if we needed anything else. They really seemed to appreciate their customers. GB&B also follows the European concept, that their staff is paid a fair wage so the prices include a 15% tip. It is also a BYOB restaurant.\n\nWe started with the Avocado Toast. This was really good with a combination of ingredients (chipotle honey, mascarpone cheese and grapefruit) that really worked well together.\n\nFor our main courses we had the Char-Grilled Piri Piri Chicken, the Brasserie Burger and P.B.C. Commonwealth Dry Cider Maine Muscles. The nice thing about eating as a small family, we all share each other's food and in that way we get to taste everything. The Piri Piri Chicken was a winning dish. The Piri Piri sauce was full of flavors without being overly spice. The chicken was crispy and moist and the side salad was also very good. The burger was outstanding, one of the better burgers we have had. I wasn't too sure about the English muffin but it worked well with the Gouda cheese and bacon jam. The burger was juicy without the muffin being soggy either. The Muscles were also a good dish and the sauce was with bacon, garlic, herbs and sea salt had us asking for more bread for dipping.\n\nFor dessert we had two very nice items, a lemon poppy seed pound cake with berries and a blackberry tart. Both were excellent and not overly sweet. Girard Brasserie also serves French press coffee.\n\nWe were about $30.00 per which includes the 15% service charge.

They bake their own muffins and coffee cakes, and even their milk and burgers pump and grind from nearby cows. Taste and texture are from the hands of neighbors. \n\nThey have a fair wage policy for all employees. That means everyone earns a reasonable living income ($14./hr now). This encourages long term commitment from workers and ownership, and shows great respect for people. As a result a 20 % tip is included in every check. Nothing more required unless you feel it warranted. Yes, this makes it difficult to express dissatisfaction with service or food quality through tipping, but on balance there is far more good from this approach, than negative. \n\nTheir Elixr Coffee is hot and strong. Cold brew is also available at a small premium. In exchange for their smallish cups, refills are attentively prompt. In truth, the tables are smallish, too, so saving space makes sense. \n\nThe room itself is tight, but brightly yellow. An odd angled ceiling helps with acoustics and gives a slight unreality to the space. Big windows overlook Fishtown, a corner of Philly undergoing a distinct renaissance. \n\nFinally, our breakfast ( I don't do brunch ) was excellent. The Breakfast Burger was a double patty, thick bacon and sunnyside up egg on brioche bun that was juicy and fun. The side of fries was crisp and plentiful. Their homemade hot sauce, a kick in the pants when poured on generously. We shared a square of their peach/basil coffee cake. Both ingredients were easily palatable, and to our delight, it was not overly sweet, but allowed to make it's own quiet statement. Delicious. \n\nGirard checked all the boxes that matter, and a few not normally considered. \n\nImpressive!", "date": "2017-07-09 20:23:52", "useful": 18, "funny": 5, "cool": 10, "user": {"review_count": 3131, "average_stars": 3.68, "yelping_since": "2012-12-16 23:26:39"}}

Perhaps being from NYC I'm a little jaded on the brunch frontier (even though I don't really brunch lol), but this place was just ok to me.\n\nWe arrived to a line, but you are unable to put your name down - you just kind of stand behind the person in front of you and wait. The way they seat people is also just off. I understand wanting to seat 4 people at a table of 4, but it seems counterproductive to have 3 sets of 2 people just wait and wait while staring at an empty table for over 30 minutes. To add insult to injury, a 4 person group just happens into the place and they are seated right away. By the way, the table I speak of is able to be separated into 2 tables of 2.\n\nFinally after waiting way too long, we are seated at the counter area. I ended up getting the biscuit and with gravy which was good, but very salty (i love salt) and small. My husband got pancakes and something I can't remember and it was fine also. I also got a fresh squeezed orange juice which was very good, but at $4 for my baby cup, it felt like a rip-off. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't anything wow. Having faced the kitchen the whole time, we saw that the workers back there were overworked - it was nonstop orders coming in and they looked exhausted. Seemed like a family run business, but they also didn't seem to care if you left due to their backwards seating system because no one really acknowledged you unless you are first in line and standing there for at least 10 minutes.\n\nI wouldn't need to come back here.\n\nP.S. They also had something called #onefairwage where they automatically charge 20% gratuity to the checks \"in order to provide our hard working employees a guaranteed living wage.\" EXCUSE ME, as an owner, they should be the one responsible for paying a fair wage for their workers to live. I thought it was ridiculous that they are only \"guaranteed a living wage\" from forcing their patrons to pay. We always leave 20% or more, but that seems like a way for business owners to cheap out on their workers and take advantage of customers.

I've never had it before, but it's what the craze is all about now, and don't know whether it's a blessing or a curse that I had it here (it was awesome!).\n\nVisiting a good friend all weekend, we were lucky to try so many good restaurants and this was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had in a long time.  Even looking at other people's review, I can tell that this place has consistency.  We walked into this bright restaurant on Saturday late morning for brunch.  I still had my coffee from La Colombe so I politely asked our host/waiter if it was OK for me to bring it in (and if not, that's completely fine and I'll throw it out).  He was taken aback that I asked because he told me nobody has ever asked him and that it was definitely OK for me to bring it in.  He was an extremely nice guy!\n\nWe split a couple of small dishes, such as the aforementioned avocado toast and the pistachio-butter & banana sandwich.  The avocado toast was amazing - granted, I've never had it before, but it was on this pumpernickel bread and all the flavors worked magically together.  I'm typically not a fan of pumpernickel bread, but with the thick avocado (picture guac, but more \"spreadable\") and the additional toppings, it all worked really well.  In addition to the avocado, there was pickled asparagus, goat cheese, and some radish slices.  The pistachio-butter & banana sandwich was tasty, but really sweet.  Granted, we all put syrup on it because that's how you're supposed to eat it, but the syrup added a whole other layer of sweetness that it didn't necessarily need, but it was still sweet and moist.\n\nI ordered the country-style breakfast as my main brunch entree and it was really good.  I got scrambled eggs, which were seasoned perfectly, and their home fries are thinly-sliced potatoes the size of quarters, and they were great.  The biscuit was a bit dry, but warm and tasty.  The charred grapefruit was interesting - definitely a cool concept and great in theory, but I'm just not a fan of grapefruit.\n\nOverall, an awesome place in the neighborhood and I definitely want to check them out for dinner sometime...one of the best brunches I've had, hands down.", "date": "2015-06-30 02:22:58", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 389, "average_stars": 3.73, "yelping_since": "2010-09-17 17:24:01"}}

We were greeted at a side door and sat immediately. Although our server was a little but awkward, he was kind and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time. \nWe started with two cappuccinos that were decent, but small. \nWe then each got a sandwich, mine was a croque madam and he got a burger. The food took over 20 minutes to be cooked and we were the only people in the restaurant. When I got my sandwich, I took a bit and the inside was cold. At first I thought that maybe it was supposed to be cold, but after asking our server, he informed us it was to be warm. They took it and back and reheated the same sandwich. 10 minutes later I get my heated up sandwich and it was just OK. No bad, not good, just forgettable. \nMy boyfriend asked for his burger medium rare, but it came out well done. He was hungry and decided to eat it anyways, saying the bun it was on was good but the rest was just meh. \nWe paid with a credit card and saw there was no line on the credit card slip to leave an additional tip. I work in the restaurant industry and DO NOT think $12/hr is a good, livable wage. Honestly, I think it's offensive that the owners of this place are trying to pride themselves on being \"fair\" to their employees, whenever it's clear they're simply using the \"no need to tip\" feature as a way to bring attention to a restaurant that is otherwise boring, forgettable and uncomfortably designed. \nI'm sure I'll stop by again in a couple month to see how things are going, but I would never recommend to a friend.", "date": "2014-11-25 19:58:32", "useful": 5, "funny": 9, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 33, "average_stars": 3.58, "yelping_since": "2010-12-11 00:55:01"}}

A great concept for a restaurant in this generation--no tipping required. I love the idea that the owners are giving their staff a living wage and benefits to boot. (Tip anyway! Everything is great!)\n\nI visited with a party of three others on Girard's second night open--11/22/14. The entire place was running like a well-oiled machine, which can be suprising for a place that just opened. \n\nThe only hiccup of our visit was that there seemed to be some kind of misunderstanding for my friends order with the waitress... But I have to chalk it up to it being the restaurants second day.\n\nI ordered a prixe fix meal because it was a great deal-- App, meal, dessert for fair price. I had celery soup to start--the flavor was amazing and not what I was expecting. It tasted like amazing thanksgiving day stuffing somehow. There was not a drop left in my bowl. I had the roast beef as my main--very tender--and the horseradish sauce was amazing. For dessert I had the chocolate tart. It was very good! But if you're not a huge fan of chocolate, I would either share it or get a different dessert as its one of those chocolate desserts that leaves you full after a few spoonfuls.\n\nThe rest of my party savored and  enjoyed their food as well. We all tried  a little of each other's. The avocado toast was sooo good! The flavors are so tasty--it was even a little spicy. The burger was amazing and the potatoes are so so good! I've been craving the burger and potatoes since we've been there. The philly muffin the burger comes on is so nice and crusty. I also tried my wife's pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was amazing. It was smooth and light. We all also shared a charcuterie plate--amazing!!\n\nI can't wait to return to try their breakfast foods--they're served all day! \n\nThe atmosphere was lovely: the decor is modern--I like the yellow and black color palette. The space is cozy, but you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other diners--which I hate. The vibe is chill, but fancy. The staff is knowledgable, friendly, and attentive. The owners and lovely--the chef comes up with the best flavor combos! \n\nMAKE YOUR RESERVATION!", "date": "2014-12-06 04:41:58", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 117, "average_stars": 4.14, "yelping_since": "2012-02-05 17:00:15"}}
