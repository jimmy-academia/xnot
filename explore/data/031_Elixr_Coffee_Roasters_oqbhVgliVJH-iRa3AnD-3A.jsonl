Definitely has a come in with friends and talk/hangout feel. Originally I liked Elixr coffee shop, but the longer I stayed there the less and less I'm liked it (background check - I'm also an introvert). There's just too much stimulation in one location. Also the coffee shop was packed! There was basically no seating. \n\nCoffee: Got a decaf pour over for pretty cheap! So I'm super happy about that. The coffee is pretty good. Strong and tempers well with cream. It doesn't hit you as hard as some other coffee's I had (very few though) but definitely still has good, well developed taste. The coffee was gentle enough to drink black - of course I still added cream because I like a thicker cup\n\nOther options: Didn't order anything else but it looks like they have a decently fresh looking variety of pastries in addition to teas. The cool thing about tea is that they give you a glass teapot for you to pour your own cup\n\nService: Service was super nice. I asked for a decaf - which not all smaller shops are prepared to serve - and they made me a pour over. I have a feeling if you asked for something the servers here would try their best to make it. Very laid back chill people, not very chatty - but that's fine of course. \n\nLayout & Location: The coffee shop is kind of hidden, it's on a small street between 15th and 16th. They did a very good job maximizing space and providing all sorts of work spaces. My favorite is the bar height table near the large window (overlooking... dumpsters and other passerby-ers). There's also a large main table, tables for two, and a couch area. There are ample plugs hidden everywhere - like under the couch.  Again, it's pretty loud here given that they're playing music super loud (Top 40) and there's a lot of people talking\n \nD\u00e9cor: Somewhat of a cross between a graffiti park and a laboratory... I like the dishware because the rim of the coffee isn't too thick (I know random right). The couch bench thing and the large collaborative main table is super unique and cool about this location. The bathroom, though placed at the very front of the shop and that's a bit... weird, was really unique in its own way.", "date": "2016-07-14 22:17:31", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 44, "average_stars": 3.55, "yelping_since": "2015-11-25 18:47:25"}}

I went to a Starbucks after having to be outside for a while (only to charge my phone and use the wifi to search for a local coffee shop that may be able to give me my hot chocolate fix in the area.

The barista at the counter looked at me as if immediately prepared to take my order and I said I was undecided. \"No rush take your time!\". I can't have dairy, so I asked about their milk options. Soy-sold. Is the hot chocolate milk chocolate? Cocoa powder and nope. Double sold. I rarely buy hot chocolate anywhere, usually make it at home, and am very picky about it in general. Kind of a hot chocolate snob. The shop has such good reviews, its freezing out, I've had a rough few days so why the hell not? Go for it, treat yourself. I am glad I did. It was delicious to the point that I scraped the mug clean. \nElixr is so warm and welcoming, spacious for people to work, hang out, sit solo (like I did), and relax.

I don't want to say I'm a coffee elitist, but I definitely pride myself on recognizing a decent cup of Joe. That's why I was so surprised that this place had flown under my radar for quite some time.\n\nMy friend and I decided to stop here after a de-lic-ious lunch at Good Dog Bar just across the street (check out my review!). When ordering coffee, I typically steer toward cafe au lait's, but I decided this time to go for the highly recommended pour over, using their Guatemalan roast. Now, while I understand that a pour over is as much a science as it is an art, I was disappointed when the barista preparing my drink completely botched her first attempt (how hard can it be to weigh coffee beans? Especially when you have a chart and scale in front of you...).\n\nI think this is the perfect opportunity to mention that while perusing other reviews, prior to my visit, I'd read that the baristas here can sometimes come off as a tad bit rude: preoccupying themselves in conversation, whether it be with each other or with friends in the shop. I'd hoped this wouldn't be the case during our visit -- there's nothing worse than that arrogant, pretentious attitude you sometime encounter at high-brow coffee shops -- sadly, I must now join the ranks of the disgruntled.\n\nMy friend, who'd ordered a cappuccino, stood patiently with me at the counter waiting for her order. While my barista was hard at work preparing her second attempt at my pour over, I noticed the other barista, deep in meaningless conversation with his buddy (who was standing directly next to us in line), was haphazardly preparing my friend's drink. Once done, and without skipping a beat, the barista put the drink on the counter (in front of his friend), continued his conversation, and made no acknowledgement that her drink was ready. Only because I'd been paying attention to what he was doing did I realize that the drink he'd made was indeed hers.\n\nI informed her that it was her drink, and sent her off in search of seats, which are limited, due largely to the fact that much of the space is occupied by communal tables. A concept which in theory is a great idea, but in practice means one or two people spreading their things across half the table.\n\nAnother 5 minutes and I was finally able to join my friend and enjoy my long awaited coffee. While the wait was a bit long, it was definitely worth it, seeing as my pour over was delicious. Just the right temperature, low acidity, with subtle notes of grapes and berries. My friend also really enjoyed her cappuccino, though when I tasted it, it was a little weak; both on taste and temperature.\n\nAll in all, Elixr's a decent place to grab a decent cup of coffee. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try it out; however, if you find yourself in this part of town with a bit of time and patience on your hands, by all means check it out.", "date": "2011-08-30 20:27:26", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 12, "average_stars": 4.15, "yelping_since": "2011-05-11 21:21:28"}}

They use PT's coffee. I would judge them on how they brew the coffee because Elixr has no power over how the coffee is roasted.  If the coffee is bad you can brew it with gold and it will suck, anyway. A truly independent coffee shop will be a coffee shop that roasts their own coffee like every little indpendent coffee shop will do in Europe.  Elixr, Ultimo, Good Karma, etc... buy coffee elsewhere then bank on marketing to hide their mediocrity. Marketing should be a tool to say what you really do,  not what you do not do and tell the consumer you do, because it's all you care about. It's to make a lot of money. The people who really care about coffee take the time  to blend and roast them and brew a unique flavor.  In this country we use marketing to make people believe what is not true. Everybody follows like a herd of sheep. I really think the misuse of marketing really kill a lot talent, especially coffee shops. At least Starbucks even roasts their own coffee, despite their corporate model. It's very sad how people view coffee in this country. At least we have evolved from the 80's thanks to Starbucks, Stumptown, Blue bottle, Intelligentsia, La Colombe, and all the little independent coffee roasters.  It's not a science or art to brew coffee. It's an art to blend and roast coffee. Elixr and companies are avoiding the source of good coffee. They focus on brewing.

AND it's in my old hood so I didn't even have to walk past Broad street to get good coffee. Plus they have awesome slate tiling, marble countertops, vintage wood, and nice COMMUNAL (not picnic!) tables made by the Amish.\n\nElixr brews Kansas' PTs - lovely espresso blends, wonderful single-origin hand-pours, all with a great variety of flavor profiles. Like bright coffees with hints of citrus? Or chocolate-y, nutty, caramel-y? They definitely have em. They are more than happy to answer any questions, so don't be shy if you are new to the coffee world.\n\nBaristi are totally awesome/handsome/friendly. My favorites, just to name a few - Evan (the really really ridiculously good looking owner) + Blake (ask him to speak Arkansas) + Charley (he can make some mean spro!), etc. They take care in making your drinks and if you aren't happy with it (within good reason), they will not hesitate to remake it for you. \n\nPrices are extremely reasonable for an artisanal/specialty coffee shop. I'm sick of hearing people complain about the prices of coffee. We all need to be more educated on what goes on at coffee farms, the fact that they are DIRECT trade, and that everything is of the highest quality. Coffee is a commodity like oil/gas, prices rise, most specialty coffee shops do not change the price of their drinks despite increasing prices of coffee. So yes, I'd be more than happy to spend $3-$4 (don't forget to tip!) for some good stuff. \n\nAlso, they carry Au Fournil (O-foor-knee) pastries - closest thing I've had to real French pastries in Philly. My favorites are the almond, cream cheese danish, and pain au chocolat.\n\nElixr is a great place to relax, slow down, and get a mean cup of coffee.

As soon as you walk in it feels like you accidentally walked into an urban outfitters. I just get the slightly pretentious trying too hard vibe. Everyone there was wearing skinny jeans and beanies. The line was long, the menu's weren't accessible until you got all the way to the front. Then you have to make a split second decision on artisan coffee you've never heard of before. \n\nI cracked under pressure and asked the barista for what his favorite was and he recommended the Ethiopian but he couldn't tell me why (\"it's good if you like strong roasts\" or \"something different\" etc etc. maybe that's just me, but if I ask for a recommendation I'd like to know why YOU like it and maybe i'll like it for the same reason.) \nMy friend and I also ordered a cinnamon roll (very meh) and a scone. The barista accidentally dropped it on the floor and was apologetic but the downside is that there were no more. I don't blame the barista, accidents happen, the issue was that it seemed like there were only 3-5 pastries available for purchase. There are no extra's or back ups. She ended up getting a peach tart (also very meh)\n\nThe coffee. So you see it being all fancily dripped so you assume it's going to taste great- I am just not a fan. There was a weird sour-y aftertaste to the coffee and just not at all what I'm used to. Call me old fashioned but I just like a plain old dark roast without all the bells and whistles. It might look like an urban coffee shop but if you are looking for simplicity- this is not it.\n\nSeating was troublesome- not because it was too busy- but because the have long tables and some people take up the entire side of the table with their laptops and notes, coats etc. and there's no polite way to be like \"excuse me your crap is taking up a lot of space, I am literally sitting on my friend and you still won't move your stuff which means either you are inconsiderate or you are oblivious, either way I hate you.\"\nWhat's more is that I ended up waiting a good long while for my coffee, and when I got it, it was lukewarm.

First, it's truly a hidden gem because it's located in the middle of a street no one has even heard of (Sydenham) and second, you feel like you're in a totally different city.\n\nAnyway, the main reason why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is due to their higher prices. The coffee is a standard size (12 oz. I think) so no need for that to be over $2 (was $2.25 to be exact) in my opinion. The cappuccinos and espresso shots go up from there, which is why I decided to start with just their regular brew of coffee. Woah, was it awesome! Even before I put any sweeteners in (love my sweets), I could tell that the coffee was a bit on the sweeter side. I've had better coffee than this (shout-out to Honduras and Nicaragua), but this was altogether an intriguing type of coffee.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was super chill and was very helpful in going through all of the choices with a newbie like me. Also, she verbally told me the prices for anything that wasn't on the menu. This was great for me personally as I hate when baristas/servers add on extra fees without informing you of them first.

I love, love to taut this places as the best espresso in the city, however, the treatment of patrons here is bordering ridiculous. There's always been a subtle attitude from the employees at this coffee bar, however, they took it to new heights last Saturday when I visited their new location before hitting a show at the Wilma. I walk in, the music is blaring, and I barely have time to think while waiting in line to order. A nice man making a pour over asked what I had wanted. I told him about three times, until he shook his head laughing that he could not understand me. (Clearly not either of our faults, the music was that loud). A second guy came up to make small talk with him instead and when the couple in front of me moved up, no one was manning the register. Finally chatty boy, when recognizing there were more people behind me, asked me what I would like, so I gave my order and asked for a croissant. I also had purchased Southpaw espresso to take home. With my hand outstretched, he slapped my change on the counter and walked away smirking without asking if I needed my coffee ground or really saying anything during the transaction. A third employee recognized that I was standing there in shock at the register, not sure what I had done, and had to walk away from what he was doing to come to the register instead, chatty boy ran to the back room. He came to the register and asked the next customer in line for their order. I asked if I could get my coffee ground, and he obliged, somewhat reluctantly. Chatty boy came out of his hiding place to snicker to the boy about me, making it a point to not make any eye contact with me the rest of my time in the store. Also want to point out that no bags exist here, apparently, except for brown paper lunch bags, which is all I got. I'd like to see what they would give me if I had bought a Chemex, but I'd probably get a dirty look for that, too. The only reason I wanted one was because I had to go to the theater and had nothing else on me to put it in, but the bag was like the exact same width, so there was no point. I waited for my drink, which still somehow took five minutes after everything else because the female barista was focused on talking with the customer behind me (clearly everyone's focus I guess, maybe I don't have the right look). I ran out of the store in utter disbelief at how rude everyone had been, and drank my macchiato and ate my croissant on the run to the show. It was just pathetic. I went to La Colombe later, also to buy coffee, and I am always able to get in and get out in minutes, and on top of that, have someone be polite and be proactive about a coffee purchase. Elixir should do the same, seeing as many of their coffees are sold in 12oz and are priced well over $20. Place just seems like a hangout for the employees to air whatever attitudes they want to air, I do not consider it to be a legitimate business, so maybe sales are not their concern, and therefore, neither are the customers. In the meantime then, if they care about financing their little barista cup trips they could do with exercising a lil bit of common courtesy. I don't give a sh*t how good the espresso is, I will never return if the employees put more effort into purposefully ignoring me or making me feel like I don't belong there then they care about producing and SELLING good coffee. It does the growers and the roaster a horrible disservice that these people are peddling their coffee.

I've been wanting to find my regular spot while I'm staying here in Philly for a few weeks. I work online and thrive working out in a coffee shop or cafe rather than sitting at home. I don't go somewhere every single day of the week, but about 3 days a week I need an awesome spot to post up at. \n\nThis coffee shop is off the main street down what feels like an alley. There's a cool #streetart mural on the wall just before you walk in. The vibe is modern, industrial and #hipster. I'll say the only thing I don't like about this place so far is the bathroom - it's right there when you walk in the front door and because of the way the door latches, there's a big gap/crack left where you feel like someone could peer in. \n\nIt's always been busy in here when I've come, with what looks like mostly students. They play good music and just the right volume... I wore my headphones the second day I've come here, but the first day actually enjoyed what they were playing. There's a seating area with a large, U-shaped couch and a communal coffee table and when you walk up the 4-5 stairs leading you to the counter, there's more tables and a long table with benches in the back. There's PLENTY of plugs which I really appreciate. It's super annoying when you go to a coffee shop and there are only 1-2 plugs in the most inconvenient locations... and then everyone's fighting over them. \n\nI really love the fact that the staff here is really polite and friendly. I mean, I haven't gotten into a conversation with anyone yet, but I really enjoy a good hipster coffee shop, but I really DON'T enjoy when the staff is uber pretentious and snobby. You don't get that here. You feel welcomed. \n\nSo far, I've had an incredible oat milk cappuccino (they don't carry almond milk so I'm assuming this is their only dairy-free milk option) that was so perfectly smooth (I think I'm obsessed!) and rich. I had a latte the second day, just to switch it up, and it was definitely good, but, cappuccino is the way to go here. It's not one of those overly foamy ones, but certainly not skimpy either. \n\nThey really know their coffee here, and although I'm more of an espresso girl myself, I will try the pour over when I'm there next time. They've got a good selection of not commonly found teas, and as a tea connosiour, I really appreciate that. They baked goods look delish and I also love that my cappuccino was only $3.50! For a dairy-free one with such, such good quality? Can't beat that. \n\nI wouldn't call this cozy, and it's certainly really busy, but it's not stale and professional either.

Tucked away on this side street is one of the better-known coffee roasters in town. If you're feeling bold (or if the caffeine addiction comes a-itching), follow the crowd to see what the buzz is about.\n\nImmediately, the blasting low-fi music and the distinct aroma of coffee give you a good sense of what Elixr is all about. Across from the entrance, a stainless steel barn door marks the no-purchase-required unisex stall, and to the left, you are led into a long space divided into two levels. Closer to the entrance are long cushioned benches surrounding a communal coffee table. The back half of the coffee bar is mezzanine-ed and houses a collection of table space. This coffeehouse channels chic industrial vibes, featuring an exposed HVAC, wooden flooring and furniture accents, tastefully-grungy exposed brick, and high bay windows. \n\nSeasonal single-origin brews and an assortment of offbeat espresso beverages (such as the autumnal Squash Kombucha latte) are all the rage here. Even midday on a weekday, Elixr may have a line weaving down from the mezzanine toward the entrance. Wifi is free and fast, and seating is usually available. The real tragedy, though, is that the table area, which is more conducive to work, has a dearth of outlets. Power stations are plentiful at the benched common area, but without a convenient place to spread your devices. To be fair, Elixr is more of a hangout joint than a productive, cookie-cutter coffeehouse. But the lack of practicality makes Elixr lower on my tier list of ideal coffee spots for the everyday grind.", "date": "2019-04-20 01:33:12", "useful": 7, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 211, "average_stars": 4.08, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 22:23:33"}}

The menu is very limited and doesn't describe what is actually in the coffee. I de used to try a chai tea latte because who can really mess that up? Well turns out this place can. It had a much too strong chai masala taste which made it almost undrinkable. For $4/5 a drink I expected much more.\nI also ordered a pastry with my drink and from a minimal selection I went with a scone. Ahh at last something to look forward to oh but I wouldn't know since the barista dropped what was the last one so I had to go with my second choice. The fruit tart I asked for next was average nothing to rave about but sadly the best part of my visit.\nThere is a lot of seating compared to most places but it's community tables. Students and other people who came their to work have sprawled their laptops and books and jackets while others squeeze in between hoping to get comfortable.\nMy friend ordered an African roast blend but absolutely hated it!

No question PT's roasts are good, pour overs are nice and never rushed.  The espresso is excellent. Latte art, if you care about that sort if thing, is indulged.  My only problems are one major issue and one minor quibble.  \n\nThe major issue is that the place has gotten just filthy.  Sit by the front windows and witness the dirt and grime and watch dozens of mosquitoes bite your arms and buzz up and down the windows, they must have standing water somewhere.  I have had the same issue the last several times there and have the itchy bites to prove it.  Also, spend five seconds looking at the coat of dirt on the floor and the hairballs drifting about, it's really disgusting.  The shop is run by twenty-something year old guys, so no surprise, but they have to learn the hard way that you just have to buy a cleaning service, no excuses, you run a food and beverage business and getting lax on this kind of thing is not an option.  \n\nthe smaller issue I had is every time I have come in, the short red-haired barista is an impossible dick.  I have rarely seen anything like that.  He has inappropriate conversations, loudly argues with coworkers, is condescending (dude...you are a barista), is unpleasant with customers -he'll barely acknowledge you while you wait to make an order, never makes eye contact, won't take your money and will make you sit there watching him do your pour over for four minutes while you stand there with three dollars in your hand waiting for an invite to pay and have a seat while you wait.... The kid is just remarkably pathologic.  \n\nOtherwise I agree with a lot of the other comments.

It was also the first coffee I had drunk after a two-week coffee hiatus, that although calming, was lacking some necessary life-spice.  Elixr provided a reviving tonic of creamy, perfect deliciousness to combat this circumstance.  \n\nThe coffee is equally as good as Odd Fellows Cafe/Spruce Street, and the only reason I am rating it lower is that the lighting is slightly less bright, and the location makes it a little crowded.  You will probably have to share a table (there are only two large wooden ones with benches on either side).  It looks to be a pretty good space to spread out books and laptop accessories as needed, but probably only for short periods of time, because, being in Center City, it gets a lot more foot traffic than it would if it were in, say, University City.  \n\nBut despite the crowding, the atmosphere is companionable, and you will at least share a friendly table-sharing nod, might have a short conversation with your fellow-table-sharer-ee, will undoubtedly be able to eavesdrop on all of a conversation if you find one interesting, and could very easily join in if you are feeling friendly.  If you are feeling unfriendly, the large windows make it an excellent space to people watch, with perhaps one other sarcastic friend to trade judgements with (too many additional friends and you wouldn't fit; the counters are too small at the windows).  \n\nFurthermore, it is is comparatively affordable.  All the lattes are the same size, and more or less the same price: $3.50 with a $0.25 addition for soy milk.  \n\nConveniently funky and friendly, Elixr is a satisfying antidote to the boring, businessy side of Center City Philadelphia.

This place just opened about three weeks ago, and it is a pretty promising little place in a nice location. Walk in and you'll find a small space with two long picnic tables (literally), some bar stools along the wall and two armchairs in the corner. Not a whole lot of space, but if you find a seat the ambience is pretty nice. They started their music track half way through my stay here... it is pretty unimposing stuff but at first started a bit loud... I felt like my friends and I were talking louder to get over the background sound. \n\nThe coffee here might seem a bit pricey (2.50-3.00 for drip coffee), but the quality is quite good and worth it to coffee aficionados... I wouldn't really know since I don't claim to be one. I am just an avid admirer of good coffees. The coffee here is direct trade, which is a form of fair trade, so that's a big plus. If you're interested in more details about this and about Elixr in general, check out my friend's coffeeshop blog here: http://phillycacophony.blogspot.com/2011/02/review-elixr.html.\n\nI haven't tried the latte yet but that'll be my next selection, as lattes are usually my drink of choice. The El Salvador drip was very tasty. My gripes, though, are enough to bring my rating down to a 3... although most of the reviews up here are 4 stars, I think it is about a 3.5. Here are some reasons why: \n- internet is not entirely reliable, sort of shoddy and sometimes slow\n- not a lot of seating\n- outlets are scarce... 2 along the wall and one electrical strip beneath one of the long tables. \n\nOverall - lots of promise, looking forward to the latte!

Several times a day. \nBut when a NEW place opens in town, I, of course, being of sound (ish) mind and caffeine-craving body, must explore... experience...evaluate. Today, on a la-di-da afternoon when everone sauntered aimlessly about town, I set out on a mission to seek the new spot. I had read a few of the reviews, and prepared myself for some picnic tables and a varietal selection with a pour-over method, very similar to Spruce Street Espresso. Now, the term \"picnic tables\" is not really accurate...they are communal tables that happen to be beautifully hand-crafted from special wood by a guy from Amish Country. And it's really a nice way to feel connected to like-minded coffee lovers, in the way that places like Talulas Table, Le Pain Quotidien, or some other shops are catching on. \nService was not only friendly, but patient and willing - nay, ADEMANT, to please. The Baristas were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their product without being overbearing (many new places make this mistake and it makes for an uncomfortable experience, note the token phrase \"Have you been here before?\" Ugh.). I felt completely at ease as one Barista and I discussed my varietal options which were listed with accompanying flavor profiles. I personally prefer a dark roast coffee as thick as sludge and as espresso-like as you can get. The Barista said the darkest of what was available was probably the El Salvador, but that it honestly was not a dark roast. While waiting for my brew (this is not WAWA so don't expect a grab-n'-go situation...this is connoisseur country, mutha...) a woman came in and wanted brewed coffee...IMMEDIAMENTE. Today they didn't have coffee on tap. Usually they will have one varietal brewed in the urn, but today they only had enough beans to accomodate single cups. She was unwilling to wait, and pretty vocal about her frustration. I giggled to myself as the staff received her negativity with polite patience and sincerity. \n         I swirled and sniffed before I sipped, as I usually do with a new coffee, and alas! I didn't like it. It just wasn't for me. I was so sad, not because I didn't enjoy my expensive coffee, but more because - well, I liken it to someone giving you a wrapped Christmas gift, and you are so touched, and they are excited to have you open it and love the gift, and you hate it. You want to love it, but you don't...and they say \"I have the gift receipt...\" and you want to say \"no, no...it's great... thank you so much.\" but dishonesty only creates an elephant in the room of a friendship...and I wanted to be honest here, so I said as apologetically as I could \"I don't like it\". \n         The owner, a man so beautiful to look at I felt like I was tripping over my words the entire time, was determined to please me (if only more men understood this) and offered to brew me a cup of Ethiopian himself. While he was crafting my new drink (no he did not make me pay again), I learned he had spent time living in Indonesia, how proud he was of his new business (and yes, how excited he was about the communal tables. They really are beautiful.), and how passionate he is about coffee. I learned that the coffee they buy costs them more than I would ever expect, and that sustainability and quality are really priorities for him. He is humble and happy to be doing what he is doing, and his employees reflect his energy. It was intoxicating to stand among such proverbial warmth. \n       The Ethiopian was closer to my preferences, although not my favorite. But we talked in depth about flavor profiles and what I might like, things I know I DO like, and about the possibility of regular cupping events that he will host. I can't wait.\n         The food in the case looked amazing. I didn't recognize the pastries from anywhere I'd seen, but the almond crossaints looked like works of art, they were so beautiful. The sandwiches, I have read, are done by Marathon. I am over the moon about this place. Anyone who is as into coffee for coffee's sake as I am will be appreciative of a cafe of this caliber in the area. You don't come here for a 7-Eleven cup of blech. You come here for coffee that you enjoy because it's coffee. Good coffee. But what scores the extra point on the TD here is the staff. I got the feeling that I would be treated as well as I was today even if it weren't their opening week. \n......And, you know, being so beautiful that you make Gale turn into a blithering puddle of jimmer jammer (no - I have no idea what that even MEANS) doesn't hurt, either.
