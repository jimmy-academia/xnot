We went into it knowing we wanted to binge.  We ordered (to take out because we work from home) the meatball parm sandwich with steak fries and the chicken cutlet sandwich with steak fries.  I asked on the phone about how much it would be and also how long it would take.  He informed me that with the steak fries (a little extra) it would be about $20 (not too bad I guess but I hope theyre big decent sandwiches because for 10$ a plate, I hope it's large).  He told me to give him 10 minutes- that's where I nearly fell in love!  I so appreciate them getting it out so quickly!  This place is cash only but they do have an ATM so thats good.  When I went to pick up the food I was delighted at how quick the process was, in and out and the parking was awesome too.  The food turned out to be excellent and well worth any amount of money.  Tons of food (I had a LOT of leftovers- but then again the chicken cutlet sandwich is a heavy dish and very filling).  My boyfriend LOVED his meatball parm and the steak fries were done perfectly.  Just the perfect experience.  Please know that if you choose the meatball parm or chicken cutlet sandwich, dont expect to feel light after; this is definitely like comfort food so dont come here on a diet. \n\nAll in all, great job guys!!

The funny thing is I defended this place for so long, while my boyfriend almost instantly saw through it.  \n\nTheir menu should have a huge SUBJECT TO CHANGE stamp on top.  One time my boyfriend and I were having brunch upstairs.  He tried to order *THREE* different things.. they were \"out\" of all of them.  Lol what?  That's fine if you're out, but maybe the server should give a warning (it's not ridiculous, I've seen it).  Another time at brunch, I ordered a mimosa.  The server said \"we're out of mimosas, can I get you something else?\" So I (clearly begrudgingly) settled for white wine.  My boyfriend also wanted a mimosa.  The server goes \"OK hang on....\" and then brings him a mimosa and me a white wine lol WTF?\n\nAnother time, I stopped in just for tea before I left for work.  In the middle of my order, the barista had to take a call.  The customer who called in was ordering a breakfast sandwich for pickup.  I thought to myself, \"that's a great idea,\" so I added an egg white and tomato on rye toast to my order.  So I was very confused when my total was $9.60.  When I confronted the barista about it, he broke it down for me (the \"sandwich\", egg white, and tomato were all separate costs).  I canceled the order (they hadn't started making it yet) and explained why I thought that made no sense --a sandwich so simple just shouldn't cost $7.00-- to which the OWNER responded, \"Well why don't ya just make it at home next time.\"  YEAH OK NO.

Unfortunately, I stand dumbfounded by the experience I had there this afternoon. We were offered a free small cup of coffee with our 20 minute wait time for a table of two, which, in my opinion, a wait at any breakfast spot is to be expected on New Years Day. After waiting about 40 minutes, we were told our table would be ready in \"under five\" and waited an additional 10 minutes. For the extensive wait, a barista downstairs offered us a complimentary muffin, which was an appreciated gesture. \n\nAfter finally being seated, our bespectacled waiter asked us if we wanted a coffee or a beverage outside of the water on the table. We asked for two coffees with cream. After waiting 5+ minutes for our coffee, the waiter came back to our table profusely sweating and again asked if we wanted coffee. We let him know we wanted two coffees with cream and were ready to order our food. He replied \"oh great easier for me! What can I get you?\" Our coffees arrived soon after without cream. After waiting about ten minutes for the cream, we realized it must have been forgotten so we politely asked our waiter for it and his reply was \"in a minute.\" We then asked a neighboring tables waitress for cream who immediately brought it over from where our waiter was standing when he said \"in a minute.\"\n\nAt this point it had been about 20 minutes since we placed our order with our waiter. The neighboring table, that ordered after us with the other waitress, had been eating their meal for at least 5 minutes. We considered getting up and leaving but didn't feel it was the right thing to do and assumed our food was on its way out. Our waiter then approached the table and asked if we had any questions. We stared back at him mystified, so he added \"about the menu.. or are you ready to order.?\" We reminded him that we already ordered and he proceeded to itch a strange rash on his neck (with a hand that was so scabbed up it looked like it was caught in a garbage disposal) and asked if we placed the order with another staff member. At this point, we told him we had placed our with him a little more than 20 minutes ago. Knowing our order never made it to the kitchen, we decided to get up and leave. The waiter laughed anxiously and we assured him it was okay, but neither of us have ever experienced something like this before. \n\nI can't really speak to the quality of the food here because I unfortunately did not get to really try it.

That was my thought process to swing into this Fishtown cafe and well, you know what they say about expectations...\n\nHigh ratings had me hopeful of espresso shots comparable to Reanimator just down the street-- man oh man was I wrong.

On initial research this place offerred vegan options. However upon arrival I didn't see anything on the menu and when I asked the server she said nothing is vegan.

The complimentary Bloody Mary was bangin (very horse radishy). They also brought over some complementary muffins. My roommate and friend who ordered their food and ate the muffins raved about what they had.\n\nThe baguette for the sandwich was massive and filled me with envy as my roommate chewed away. \n\nAll in all, they're not for everyone and it's a little disappointing to be such a hip cafe spot but not have even 1 vegan option.", "date": "2020-01-28 19:55:48", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 256, "average_stars": 4.22, "yelping_since": "2013-08-16 19:44:22"}}

We were sat right away but then sat there for a half hour until a waitress even acknowledged us to take our food order.

FINALLY asked a \ndifferent waitress where our food was and she proceeded to tell us they just put it in. Mind you our original waitress NEVER came back and no apologies were handed out. NO COMPS, APOLOGIES OR ANYTHING! Other waitress asked us how long we waited and she DID NOT even believe us. The lady then gave us a verbal IOU like it was a sacred blessing she bestowed upon us. As we were leaving a rhinestone belt wearing wanna be hipster had the audacity to tell us we had ONLY BEEN THERE 20 min! Never received such terrible service and didn't even get to enjoy the food there...had to take out bc of how ridiculous the service and attitude was of the staff there. There are much better breakfast spots in this city. I cannot STRESS enough that we truly sat there for 2 hours without food or water and people that came in an hour after us received food immediately, ATE, and left.

Got there at noon and waited 20min for our waitress to come over. We ordered tea and coffee that then took over a half hour to come and only got there because the other waitress asked if we wanted refills on our nonexistent drinks. We had to ask what the specials were because our waitress forgot to tell us as well. After ordering food we waited another hour for it to arrive and when we asked where it was she said she only just put it in 10min ago. Tables who were seated after us received their food and left before we got ours. Took an hour and a half total for our food to finally get there and nothing was comped or discounted. We were so upset by the service we just asked for the food to go instead and only realized when I got home that one of the orders was wrong and didnt even feel like going back to complain. A guy downstairs, who had nothing to do with our order or service, even accused us of lying about how long we waited and said we were only there for 25min, because he is apparently omniscient. Its one thing to make a mistake but at least rectify it by discounting the check and you never accuse the costumer of lying or being wrong. But dont worry, we got a nice \"we'll get you next time\" when we were leaving. Might be waiting a bit for that one though...

I was told the coffee was really good. I decided on the ginger bread chai latte w/oat milk and that was really tasty. \n\nWe walked right in and waited a few minutes as another customer placed their order. This gave me time to look around, and try and decide on what I wanted to eat. The menu looked appetizing and it was hard for me to make a selection. I also noticed the pastries that were inside and they too looked good. \nWhen I placed my order I then noticed the CASH ONLY sign on the register but luckily there's an ATM right inside that's gonna charge you $2.99.  I ordered the 2 eggs & cheese w/bacon on brioche bread and the latte.  I was offered a complimentary OJ, mimosa, screwdriver or Bloody Mary.
