I am probably going to get a lot of heat for this review, but they're all subjective right?\n\nI have lived in the Spring Garden neighborhood for a year and for a year I have been dying to trying Sabrina's. Everyone I spoke to kept telling me how incredible it was, and how the wait (although insane) was always worth it. \n\nOn a particularly hungover Sunday I decided to arm myself with patience and go stand in line for a big indulgent breakfast. The wait for a table for two was about 45 minutes. The place is small and since it was still chilly outside, most of us were jammed in the entrance. I saw big plates of yummy food coming and going, and the amount of people willing to wait for a table was so crazy that I had no doubt this would be a mind-blowing experience. \n\nWhen we finally sat down the service was fabulous. I am sorry I don't remember the name of the sweet server who helped us, but despite the crowd she was attentive and pleasant. I ordered a bagel with lox, my friend ordered a healthy plate of fruit and granola. Since I wanted to get a better taste of the place, we also ordered a short stack of pancakes. No frills, no healthy stuff, just straight pancakes with lots of butter and syrup. \n\nAlthough the meal wasn't bad per se, it wasn't all that mind-blowing either. I grew up in South Jersey so I am used to diners and (and here is where everyone is going to hate me) I thought Sabrina ranked among the more mediocre Jersey diner I've tried. I don't understand the hype, unless it is simply the lack of a diner in that area. I personally make better pancakes at home, and the line for a table is definitely not worth it. \n\nMaybe I simply chose the wrong menu items, but I am not sure I'll have the patience to wait another 45 minutes on an empty stomach to risk another OK meal. \n\nSorry Sabrina!", "date": "2013-05-07 18:36:30", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 117, "average_stars": 3.37, "yelping_since": "2011-09-10 23:03:36"}}

Owners Robert and Raquel DeAbreu named the original restaurant on 9th and Christian Streets after their daughter. Recently, for Memorial Day brunch, the GF, our friend, and I went to the second location, which includes the name of their son.\n\nAnd based on the success of these two joints, a third location in University City, by Drexel campus, was opened last year. The inside of Sabrina's Cafe & Spencer's Too is highly reminiscent of a neighborhood cafe/diner. Offering a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, with the occasional snarky, yet fun waitress, it's one of our favorite places to grab brunch.\n\nAnd being that Sabrina's is BYO, our friend brought some champagne along to pair with a pitcher of OJ. And yes, as expected with most BYO's, the markup on the pitcher of OJ is around 400%.\n\nBut back to the good. Sabrina's is great in that they have an ever changing menu of specials. Arrested Development aficionados known that Michael Bluth and company are back in action. So natch, Sabrina's had a bevy of 'Arrested' brunch specials. Creative, whimsical, and most importantly delicious, what's not to love? \n \nBut on this particular outing, we decided to get all of the 'signature' breakfast items.\n\nHuevos Rancheros ($10.99)\n2 blue corn tortillas, smoky chorizo sausage sauce, lime sour cream, spicy guacamole, 2 fried eggs, fried jalapeno pepper\n\nI opted for the huevos rancheros - a nice medley of different flavors, all highlighted by the bright lime sour cream. The fried eggs and chorizo sausage sauce helped to create a hearty dish, with the blue corn tortillas offering some fried texture. The guacamole was nice, but not particularly spicy, though the fried jalapeno pepper had a tempered heat that was nice to add to each bite. The accompanying home fries were crispy on the outside and creamy inside. \nPerfectly seasoned, I could eat these by the ton.\n\nBarking Chihuahua ($8.99)\nFlour tortilla, scrambled eggs, black beans, red peppers, pepper jack cheese, sour cream, marinara\n\nThe GF and our friend both got the barking chihuaha, which amounts to Sabrina's breakfast burrito. A nice iteration of this oft-seen dish, the flour tortilla had a nice grilled texture to it and contained a humongous allowance of perfectly scrambled eggs, black beans, and red peppers. The piquancy of the pepper jack helped to brighten up the dish, with the sour cream and sweet marinara adding creaminess. The fried corn chip strips helped to add additional texture to the dish. A pat of home fries accompanies the burrito as well.\n\nStuffed Challah French Toast (1/2 order $5.50; full order $9.99)\nFarmer's cream cheese, bananas, vanilla bean syrup\n\nPro tip: No matter what, get a half order of the stuffed challah french toast. If the previous two dishes were signature Sabrina's, this is their crown jewel. Not listed on the menu as a half-order option, our waitress knew that we were clearly veterans of the establishment just from this order alone. The french toast is humongous, with a nice grilled exterior and a creamy, eggy interior. This all houses a cinnamon cream cheese that is intensely sweet, yet you just can't stop with one bite. The vanilla bean syrup and fresh banana slices brings this over the top. Definitely a perfect way to end brunch.\n\nWant another tip? On weekends, Sabrina's is packed, so expect to wait at least an hour for a table. So what's a hungry bruncher to do? Call ahead by about an hour and ask to have your name put down. That way you can stroll over when it's about time for your name to be called and you won't have to wait with the rest of the sheep on Callowhill. \n\nFrankly, Sabrina's is a great place to go for any meal - not just brunch. The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, and the food is tasty. What's not to love with this Philly institution? And an added bonus?

I love to come here for any meal.  No matter what you always get a fantastic meal!  \n\nMostly, I come for breakfast/brunch!\n\nHuevo's Rancheros is one of my favorite dishes and is usually my go to when I am here for a breakfast item.  I also like the barking Chihuahua when I am feeling very hungry!  Their frittatas are also excellent.  My favorite is the egg white turkey bacon frittata.  Its is a good option if you want a bit of a healthier type breakfast, with no loss of flavor! \n\nI like to come here with my sister and young nephew.  The place isn't bad for kids.  My nephew loves the pancakes and French toast. (He also loves their French fries!)\n\nTheir fruit is always super fresh too, which I love.\n\nFor lunch, I like to get either the Mel's Chicken cutlet (so drool worthy), the Tuscan chicken sandwich, or the Mediterranean wrap.  Everything is different and so flavorful.  Portions are pretty big, so whenever I come with my mom, we often share!\n\nTheir salads are also excellent.  Very often I will split a salad and sandwich with someone I am with, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.\n\nThey do themed brunches too, which is such a great novelty!  Special menu's are available for these with cute puns as all of the menu item names.\n\nThey don't serve dinner at all of their locations, but I highly suggest checking the places that do serve dinner out.  Fantastic meal!  Our go-to's are the octopus and calamari as a starter.  Always a good pick!  If we want something a bit lighter, we go for the hummus.\n\nThe dishes I have had as my main course are the Grilled Orange Ginger Pork Chop, The Honey Melon Glazed Salmon, and the Smokey Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna.  You cannot go wrong with either.  Portions are also pretty big, so make sure you are hungry!!\n\n\nI also really like that this restaurant has plenty of vegentarian and vegan options.   I myself am a carnivore, but I do also enjoy the vegetarian options and have many vegan/vegetarian friends.   It is really nice to have plenty of choices and a variety in the menu which Sabrin'a certainly provides.\n\nThe prices here are pretty reasonable.  The only downside here, is the wait, especially on the weekends. Plus they can get crazy crowded and the space is pretty tight and can get pretty loud. However, I guess that is part of what makes Sabrina's so special.  Also, not a bad place for kids!Certainly worth a wait for the food, staff is always friendly and accommodating!  Great for smaller groups, but since space is on the tighter side, I wouldn't go in a group larger than 6.\n\nSabrina's is a great, casual, fun place to eat, I suggest you go and enjoy!", "date": "2015-07-31 13:36:03", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 268, "average_stars": 4.4, "yelping_since": "2012-10-08 14:11:35"}}

So did I!\n\nI've been a long-time dedicated fan of Sabrina's Cafe at Powelton. I was disappointed that my first time stopping this particular one couple months ago ended with disappointment when I was told the wait was 1 hour. \n\nIf you want to skip my extended review, here's the only thing I want you to take away: a little secret - they don't take reservations, but they do take call ahead seating. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS! This allowed me to reduce my wait down to 5 minutes, and everything worked so smoothly without us needing to wait. Otherwise, expect to wait 45+ min!\n\nFOOD: 5/5\n\nAlice Cooper's \"School's Out For Summer\"  Breakfast Special: Quite the proper description for me, given that school's out for summer! I loved the banana bread french toast. To be honest, I spent most of my time picking for my parents, so I didn't really read the description of what I ordered other than its awesome name. The banana bread was quite the surprise. The sweetness of the bread and maple gravy definitely stood out among the savory and salty egg scramble, but it was the perfect balance. The portions were huge!\n\nG. Love's \"Rhyme for the Summertime\" Egg White Omelette: My mom is quite health conscious after discovering that her cholestrol level was a bit too high a couple years ago. I recommended this since it was all egg white. I'm personally all about the egg yolk, but this was well prepared. The omelette was so tender, and the marscapone cheese was a great addition!\n\nSublime's \"Doin' Time (Summertime)\" Mexi Special: Hailing from Southern California, my dad absolutely loves anything that has a \"Mexi\"-style attached to it, especially when it comes with avocado. The food itself was a bit too messy for my liking. Everything seemed to be a mountain piled on top of fried tortilla bread, so that was a bit difficult, and thus disappointing, to eat. The avocado tasted fresh, and rice was well seasoned. \n\nSERVICE: 5/5\n\nAs mentioned above, take full advantage of the call-ahead seating! I promise that you'll come in happier. The waiter we had was super friendly and helpful. She helped clarify all the questions I had, allowed me to have the rice to be served on the side (Dad doesn't like onions which was in the rice), and made sure the egg white omelette my mom had didn't get messed up because it was golden yellow on the outside. My only negative feedback wasn't from this one experience, but the time before. When I was told the wait was going to be 1+ hour, I was treated quite poorly and felt like I was being pushed out the door. I'm glad that wasn't the case this time.\n\nOverall, this place is my favorite brunch place in Philadelphia! If you're too full from the huge serving, take a nice stroll along the Parkway, and consider enjoying all the wonderful attractions around - Barne's Foundation, the Basilica, Rodin Museum, Philadelphia Art Museum, City Hall, Love Park and Schuylkill River!", "date": "2013-07-01 03:11:48", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 205, "average_stars": 3.96, "yelping_since": "2012-04-27 19:44:46"}}

She really knows me, because paired with a runny egg, there is little I enjoy more.  Sabrina's style of scrapple is not my favorite; this one is much more brown with a more dense pack of corn meal than I prefer.  Along with being sliced thinly, to me, it loses some of the good flavor of the pig parts.  It was still good, for sure, but the coating overpowers the innards.\n\nBeyond that, which I fully appreciate is nit-picky, the meal was good.  I like the unchanged lunch counter/diner layout and the staff is young and fast.  Everyone was friendly, but busy, and our \"15-20 minute wait\" evaporated when I asked to sit at the bar.  \n\nIn terms of portions: I could definitely spend the same amount of money - mine was $6.29 for eggs, potatoes, and toast - and get less food.  If I got 2 slices of bread, instead of 4, and half the homies (which are great) I would still feel like I got my money's worth.  If they had eggs on the a la cart menu I would have skipped the starches today.  The scapple add-on was just under $3 for two 3x5 pieces.  A very good deal.\n\nAll-in-all this is a good place to go.\n\nShe Said: Whenever we visit a new city, my guy and I look for a good breakfast place, and I had high expectations for this place due to the reviews. We arrived early-ish on a Saturday (9:30am), and we were seated almost immediately at the bar. I asked for English Breakfast tea, and the water was hot enough that the tea was not bitter, so that was good. I thought about the eggs benedict, but I didn't want a whole lot of food. I opted for one of the egg sandwiches. Scrambled eggs, cheddar, and bacon on whole grain toast with homies. First, the homies were great. No need to ask for them extra crispy--they came that way anyway. They also weren't pre-salted which was nice. The eggs were fine, but dry. The toast was fine, but dry. The bacon was fine, but skimpy.\n\nAll in all, the food was average. The tea was great. The company was awesome. The ambiance was fine. According to Yelp, three stars mean it's A-Ok, which it was.

At first look, you'll think the place is too crowded to be at all comfortable, but once you're in and seated, you'll feel comfortable even as the wait staff move about quickly and confidently without bumping into anyone and the customers come and go with ease.\n\nThe place may be small, but the portions are HUGE! Big plates, big salads, big sandwiches, gigantic fries. If you're a person who enjoys super-sizing, without the extra cost, here's your place. \n\nAnd not only super-sized, but super-fresh! My 2 lunch mates both ordered the Greek Salad -- one with chicken, one without. The salads came with 8 pita wedges as big as the palm of my hand, a generous dollop of humus, and all the usual salad components: 2 or 3 kinds of salad greens, cherry tomatoes, green pepper slices, feta cheese...onions(?) All this was crisp and fresh; the pita was soft, airy, and slightly buttery.\n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Philly Cheese Steak with the Polenta Cheddar Jalapeno Fries. It's always a gamble when ordering a veggie steak, since I'm not a vegetarian and the taste is always lacking compared to a thick and meaty traditional steak sandwich, but I was curious to see how Sabrina's did it. The steak chunks were browned seitan. The flavor and texture were so right, somehow, that it just didn't matter. In short: it wasn't meat, but the satisfaction was the same! \n\nThe polenta fries looked like mini loaves of cornbread, they were that large. They looked as though they'd been deep fried, but tasted like they'd been baked. The flavor and the airy disintegration once in your mouth was heavenly. The cheddar, the jalapeno, and corn (polenta) tastes were blended so artfully that no single flavor dominated, but all were distinguished and equally evident.\n\nThe wait staff's timing was perfect. They appeared out of nowhere at just the right moments; our waiter was attentive enough and sincere enough to answer our questions about his hebrew-letters tattoo, even though the restaurant was obviously in the very busy lunch mode.\n\nFor the three large plates (as big as my head!) and three non-alcoholic drinks, the bill came to $40.70, including tax.

Ain't NOBODY got time to wait so I used yelp's app to add myself to the list about an hour before patronization. Due to poor time planning and poor winter street hygiene, I almost broke my fucking neck slipping and sliding while rushing here to grab my table the day after our first legit snowstorm of the year. All's well that end's well.\n\nI did make it in the nick of time. We were seated expediently once all members of my party arrived with wine and champagne in tow(aka me, no I'm kidding I was meeting other people...really tho..) in a booth in the far corner. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is not only the ridiculous variety of the menu but the ability to make many items vegetarian. So many fucking things jumped right off of the page, stuffed challah french toast with cream cheese, bananas, and honey topped with bananas  and vanilla bean syrup OR the ultimate mexi scramble with scrambled eggs, pepper jack, bell peppers, tomatoes, BLACK BEAN GRITS, cilantro PESTO, corn chips and avocado as two examples. Ultimately I had to decide and my decision was the classic: HUEVOS RANCHEROS, vegetarian variety. \n\nSo this place is BYOB. We brought some champs and ordered a large jug of OJ. We also brought something else but I don't remember what it was considering we had finished powering through the champagne. \n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time. I'm the breed of idiot that continues to make the same mistake over and over again, one of these mistakes I continuously make is forgetting to order hot suace with my meal. I struggled to flag down a staff-member as they feverishly ran by our table attending to some other shit of another table. Finally I caught someone's attention and managed to obtain a cholula for the table. This place doesn't only have bullshit tabasco, cholula and sriracha are other available options if you enjoy a side of burn-your-fucking-mouth-off as much as I.\n\nThe huevos rancheros were really a work of art, a thing of beauty.

All in all this was absolutely spectacular. One of the best brunches I've had in Philly so far. I ate the entire thing. I'm salivating at the thought of it right now. \n\nOne of my eating companions also ordered whole-wheat cinnamon pancakes which I was happy to offer to help consume. They were a touch dry but flavored wonderfully. Syrup improved the dryness. \n\nNeedless to say I was absolutely jam-packed with food in my GI tract at the end of this meal. Even the slightest of movement was torture. It probably saved me some cheddar at whole foods becacuse I could barely look at anything on the shelves. \n\nAll in all this place is a fucking gem and a must visit.", "date": "2018-01-30 21:49:14", "useful": 5, "funny": 6, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 598, "average_stars": 3.94, "yelping_since": "2015-09-02 17:30:11"}}

The food was nasty and so was the service.\n \nThey don't have great or fast service. Most of the time the staff is rude and huffy, probably because there are just too many customers crammed in there.\n\nThe eggs aren't made the way you ask, which really pissed me off.  The cream (for coffee) comes in those little plastic packets and its not real cream (it's the watered-down cheap powder crap that tastes like nothing) and the coffee tastes cheap and burned.  Overall, most of the things you get there feel very cheap and flavorless, kinda like at Midtown except you pay more for it.\n\nAnd one more thing: I'm 6 feet tall, not too abnormal, right? Well, guess what, if you're taller than 5'8, when you sit, your knees are going to be touching the knees of the person in front of you, and don't even try to sit in the booth, because they're made for short people.\n\nI also forgot to mention that they don't have a proper garbage disposal area, so they pile all of their trash on the sidewalk at the end of the day (like 20 big bags of trash), making the whole area smell like trash.\n\nThere are so many cheaper and better quality places to go to in Philly for great brunch.

Nine people walked in at around 9 pm; there was plenty of room, but all kind of interspersed through out the place so the staff decided to combine three tables into a weird L-shaped design which seemed like it would be an awkward dining experience but it worked well for the most part.\n\n2. The aforementioned staff are very friendly, going so far as to joke with individual friends in the group about various things that I wasn't paying attention to because I was so hungry. Also, BYO. Just thought of that.\n\n3. I was kind of confused as to why there were two menus that were handed to us. It was explained to me but now I can't remember. Brunch was not an option when I was there, but it looks absolutely amazing based on the pictures that others have put up so I will definitely be going back to try something else at a brunch-friendly hour.\n\n4. The food: I got some Mediterranean chicken sandwich doohickey. It was good. I was recommended the sweet potato fries. Not a fan. The first few bites were good but after a while, my brain/mouth was confused because they look like fries but taste like dessert, and it was just not a pleasant experience; I actually started getting sick of them and left a large portion uneaten. I thought that I should have gone with the parmesan fries and pilfered some from a friend's plate. Surprisingly they were even less impressive. I tried a friend's sweet potato mashed potatoes (that's kind of redundant) and what little I tried I enjoyed but I'm assuming the same problem with the sweet potato fries would happen if I had gotten that. Everyone's food looked amazing and I have a fair idea of some other things to try the next time I'm there. As of now though, I'm only moderately impressed with what I had. \n\n5. Also, maybe it's just me but why do some people just assume that when a large group of people is present and it's time to pay that the best thing to do is just combine the bill? That's just laziness. The bill comes to something like a $120+, and you thought that only one of us is going to pick up the tab for your convenience? And it's really frustrating thereafter to deal with the mess of calculating how much everyone's meal is and then hand the waitress 8 credit cards and some cash. Just split the damn bill. It's not that hard to do and it saves so much time and frustration. Not to mention, I'm less likely to stiff you on a proper tip if I'm not annoyed. Otherwise, you're going to get whatever was calculated by my friends (because I am not the math whiz in the group).", "date": "2010-06-21 15:16:34", "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 708, "average_stars": 3.5, "yelping_since": "2010-04-22 19:27:42"}}

Short story is- don't get the cheddar/apple omelet.  Long story is- hipsters managing anything is never a good thing.\n\n\nSabrina's, Sabrina's, Sabrina's...what a place!  I'm devoted to the location on the Italian Market; I go there about once every two months or so.  I've even gone for dinner before and had a very pleasant experience.  The two words that come to mind for this place are: consistently wonderful.  So one day I decided to try the Fairmount/Art Museum location.  The atmosphere was very retro chic, the hipsters were oh-so present and the staff was in their usual self involved, semi- friendly state- you know, the norm.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, I decided to go with a semi-normal (or so I thought) dish that was on the healthier side- an omelet with cheddar and apples.  After being served, I took my first bite and couldn't believe my taste buds; there was cinnamon in the apples..no wait- the apples were baked and COVERED in cinnamon.  HUH?  Not only was this not explained on the menu, it seemed to be a pretty standard dish, which was I went with it.\n\nDue to the extremely busy morning, our server never returned to the table, but across the way I saw a hipster who was well dress and seemed to be smiling- must be a manager, I thought.  Naturally, he made his way over to my table and asked how my meal was.  My response was \"well, I ordered this omelet with apples but was surprised to see cinnamon in it\". His response was \"what are you allergic?\".  \"No\", I said, \"But it doesn't state that on the menu and it just seems like an odd choice for an omelet\".  \"Well\", he said, \"that's Sabrina's! We are constantly coming up with interesting combinations\".  He then walked away.  \n\nListen, dude.  (playing the manager card-), I get and even said that I know Sabrina's very well and frequent it (and always order their specials).  All *I* was saying was that you should state that there is cinnamon on the (baked) apples in the menu- that's all.  Not only were you obnoxious and overly dismissive, you could have CARED less about the obvious.  I am a manager myself, and would never even think about handling an upset customer that way.  All you had to say was \"Sorry about that- you make a good point.  How about a free dessert\"?  POOF- the whole thing would have been over and I probably would have declined the dessert.  Instead-  all of the members in my party commented on how unbelievably rude you were, and we all left with a sour (actually sweet) taste in our mouths.\n\nThink I'll stick with the Italian Market location.", "date": "2012-01-18 17:31:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 16, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2011-08-20 18:32:44"}}

This is also supposed to be one of the top brunches in town. \n\nWe needed a tasty brunch/breakfast before we started off our Art Museum Sunday so we decided on this place. It was packed which I believe is the norm. Luckily we only had to wait for 15-20 minutes for a table(totally acceptable). As we were leaving there was a huge crowd that had gathered outside. Much of our Philly trip had those results. Apparently we were the trendsetters arriving before everyone else. \n\nSabrina's takes advantage of all of their space. There are some 2 person tables packed tightly together which makes it difficult for patrons and staff to get through. I'd advise not going with a large group. You might get lucky, but it doesn't seem like a great place to put tables together.\n\nThey have breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner options. There were quite a few things that I immediately wanted as soon as I opened the menu!\n\nI probably should've ordered something sweet but I decided to pick something off their July 4th menu. It was August 7th and they still had that menu! I'm not sure if they call it July 4th menu or if they keep it around through the summer. \n\nI chose John Hancock's Sign Me Up For That Special Breakfast. This dish consisted of blueberry cornbread(stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto), scrambled eggs, arugula, crispy bacon, and cauliflower white cheddar sauce. The cornbread was good but too dry. The white cheddar sauce did help some, but not much. The menu also said it was stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto... um, no it wasn't! I love arugula but I don't think I've ever mixed it with eggs. The scrambled eggs with arugula and cauliflower white cheddar sauce... go ahead and give me two dozen of them on a second plate! Delicious! Bacon is like bacon everywhere. It's bacon. It's either crispy, crunchy, fatty, on a doughnut, or even peanut buttery... wait, I need to stop before this becomes a Butterfinger commercial(Extra kudos if you get the reference).\n\nThe dish also came with their fried potatoes. Can we just take a moment to appreciate a place that knows the difference between a fried potato and a fry? Most places like this try to call fried potatoes what they're not(fries). Fried potatoes are obviously different than fries! Kudos to Sabrina's for that. I also added peppers to my FRIED POTATOES... great choice!\n\nI took off one star because it is a cramped space. If you need a nice quiet meal away from people or you're anti-social, then definitely don't go here. That one star off is also because it's not the best brunch I've tried. It was delicious. I didn't get the WOW factor from this place.\n\nI want to make it back for that Barking Chihuahua dish along with a dozen other things they have!", "date": "2016-08-17 17:06:43", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 684, "average_stars": 4.11, "yelping_since": "2014-09-02 15:30:13"}}

It could be me but all the online reviews of the dish didn't mention it was going to be a soupy dish (looks like it's from the veggies. Couldn't they have drained some of the broth before serving? It also makes the tots soggy. I tried it to push through despite the fact that it was a soup underneath the eggs (where the veggies laid), but just couldn't.

I alerted the waitress and she indicated it was soupy and then immediately took care of asking if I wanted something else which I ordered the Nova lox bagel ( simple dish). She rushed the order which I appreciated. This Nova lox bagel dish was ok. It came out sloppy looking. Not sure if kitchen staff was overwhelmed and just trying to get orders out, but I knew at this point, the experience was dismal due to 2 disappointing dishes.\nI wish I had taken a picture of the tots dish to show how soupy it is to just alert anyone who may be interested in ordering.

I sent them back and got some pancakes or something.  Fine.

Awesome!  The \"pitcher\" was in all actuality a 1/4 carafe!  It was two glasses with about 1/2 cup of juice left.  That was twelve dollars.  Each glass was 3.99.  Um, can you say TOTAL RIP OFF?\n\nMy friend ordered the scrambled tofu, gluten free.  The server came back and informed her that all the tofu had been prepared and that they could not make it without gluten.  Really?  What the hell kind of chefs do you have back there that cannot take a little tofu, add a little seasoning and, I don't know, scramble it?!  So she asked for fruit and home fries because that was all she could get.  She asked for it to be place on one plate, so it looked like a meal, I guess.  They brought it out in two bowls.

The food is fantastic the waitresses and waiters and hostesses are very pleasant.\n\nHowever, recently it appears that the owner will managers have changed the policy on sitting you at your table. My daughter went there to meet a friend for brunch and they will literally three people at the Palantine location sitting down and eating. She asked that she have a table for two The hostess asked if the other person from her party was here and my daughter said she is 5 to 10 minutes away. The hostess said I will have to ask the manager to see if I can seat  you as you may have to wait to your other party gets here.

My daughter said well I will be ordering my food and a drink before my friend gets here because I'm hungry.

I told the girl I'm sitting down and you can get your manager and he or  she can come talk to me if they have a problem. \n\nI can understand during a time when it is busy that you must have your entire party present before being seated. I understand that there are people who will say their party  is on their way and it could be a half hour before they come and if the restaurant is busy that they ask you to wait for your whole party to arrive. \n\nI think the policy do not seat you when the restaurant is mostly empty is ridiculous.  The managers should work with the hostesses and inform them that if the restaurant is half empty or three quarters empty that they should seat the customer right away, whether the whole party is there or not. \n\nThis is supposed to be an upscale caf\u00e9/ restaurant and if it's going to stay that way they should have an upscale attitude on how to treat a customer.

Sabrina's Cafe is a popular (as in, during summer, it's an often sight to see the Sunday brunch crowds line up outside!) series of establishments in Philadelphia, specializing in big, enormous portions for the average hungry Jane/Joe, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere enjoying classics most people are accustomed to, with their own twist, such as burgers, platters, pancakes/French toast, salads, and breakfast/lunch fare, to name a few. I haven't had a chance to enjoy their vegan/vegetarian items, but from testimonials from guests I dine with here, they're the best, and brings out the flavor they've been seeking, and can even substitute some items. There's five (5) locations, including this one close by to Philly's museums and the heart of downtown, the \"main\"/flagship/first location in Italian Market, another one in University City close to Penn U, one outside of Philly in the suburbs of Wynnewood, and a location in Collingswood, NJ, catering to those who would love to have a good meal. For those interested, they allow for BYOB, just make sure it's solely wine/beer/alcoholic beverage only, and be responsible! They're also wonderful handling kids menus, although a few offerings \"seem\" to be a bit over the top for a child.\n\nI've visited on many different occasions to the three Sabrina Cafe's in Philly, especially this location, so let's begin, and I'll base my review on my latest visit to make things relevant! Decided to visit on one of their quiet moments vs the bustling weekend, and I've made a reservation to make sure I can sit down and enjoy some of their best offerings. As what other Yelpers would allude to, portions are huge! If you're coming from a lengthy trip (in my case, near NYC), the first thing that comes to mind is to fill up on some morning delights. Starred off with a bowl of granola and fruit, it's satisfactory, can help get your morning started with some fresh fruit and a balanced breakfast. While waiting in between dishes, I've took a gander at the restaurant and paced around to convey other people's opinions: most were delighted to be there, loved the scenery, and of course, the chalk art is something to look forward to every visit. Ordered something \"simple\" in my books, a challah French toast, plus strawberries, since at the end of the day, you'll be thankful later to top it up with toppings, whether it's a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit (depends on the time of the year), marshmallows, bacon (not for me), and more instead of facing \"plain\" French toast, nothing wrong, but \"berry\" good to put Tuesday cheer! Digging in to those thick, huge slices of French toast, it's bringing me back to those carefree days where I've first arrived here - and the feeling was the same: soft, fluffy French toast inside, slight crunch on the crust, and ample amount of maple syrup. It left me at 110% satisfaction, and if time allowed, I would've ordered more. Delighted with my food and finely brewed latte, I've gave my waitress a generous thank you, and parted ways to continue my day. : ) A general wrap up, but their \"signature\" item in my mind would be the Stuffed Challah French toast, which perfectly captures the balance between bananas, honey, and cream cheese (it's Philly after all...), and seems to \"bigger\" than French toast, and pancakes are another option if you'd love to, I usually request banana or chocolate chips (premium).\n\nIn short, this is the premier brunch (or breakfast in this case) spot in Philly I would go to to unwind. Weekends, the crowd triples (or in summer, quintuples) in size, and it's a common sight to wait ~30min+ without careful planning, and service, as with other places, would be sluggish at best. Distance may be an issue in my books, but it's delighted Philly residents far and wide, and I'll definitely return!

While potentially influenced by the challenge in transporting brunch items, there was just too much inconsistency in the food.

And while I am sure eating things immediately would have helped the quality, there was clearly some inconsistencies with the food. I started with a slice of the Avocado Toast, and I felt the thick multigrain bread was a very wrong choice to be used. The Huevos Rancheros were hurt by some delay sogginess, but the overall flavor was good. The Tots were interesting, but an extremely heavy item.

They had a small table out front along the steps, which was set up to take names and to help with take-out. I did not step inside, but it looked like they had a large indoor dining space, though it had restricted capacity. In an alley along the side of the building, not even directly adjacent to the restaurant, they had set up a nice outdoor area. I assume it is only temporary, but it looked great and much more appealing than what I saw of inside.\nCrowd: We ordered our meal to-go, but most guests were dining-in, both indoor and outdoor. There was a 20 minute wait for Saturday brunch, and I assume that was actually light for the weekend.\nService: The staff was super helpful and even though our order was large and the restaurant was busy, the estimated time was spot on. \nParking: Street parking out front and a large parking lot less than a block away.", "date": "2020-10-28 23:21:22", "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 1631, "average_stars": 3.39, "yelping_since": "2016-01-01 17:41:02"}}

This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet. The hostess was nice too.\n\nI'd come back.", "date": "2019-10-27 13:04:13", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 4333, "average_stars": 3.74, "yelping_since": "2009-01-25 04:35:42"}}

Brunch is usually associated with the weekend and a gab fest a la Sex and the City. And the wonderful thing about brunch is there are only so many ways to cook eggs, pancakes, French toast, and waffles, which means it's pretty difficult for the chef to really mess it up. But that also means there's a small margin of error. The line between average fare and something more interesting / spectacular is therefore very fine. \n\nNow onto Sabrina's. Everyone and their moms talk up Sabrina's like it's Philadelphia's answer to brunch, when in fact Sabrina's notoriety is gained due to the sad void of competing bruncheries, especially in the center city / callowhill area. So, after a year in Philadelphia, I've realized that Sabrina'a gets its reputation for \"best brunch ever\" by default. I find the food at Sabrina's to be pretty pedestrian, and not really deserving of the title of best brunch ever. But of course it's still vastly superior to IHoP or Denny's. \n\nI've been to Sabrina's twice. The first time I had the stuffed French toast. I admit that I should have paid better attention to the menu description and asked for the maple syrup on the side instead of it getting drizzled directly onto a dish which I felt was sweet enough. It was my first time eating stuffed French toast and I just wasn't a fan. My friends ordered a sandwich with the Parmesan fries, a stuffed French toast with strawberries, and eggs benedict (or some sort of poached egg). Well, I've never met a potato I didn't like so I do like the home fries. And I love that the coffee comes in these homestyle mugs so you kinda feel like you're just eating brunch at a friend's. Which is a facade the servers keep up with their friendly service.\n\nThe second time I went, I got the breakfast burrito, and it was just a little too dry for me. But the service is consistently friendly. \n\nOverall, Sabrina's is decent but not worth the long wait on the weekends. I just wish people would stop overhyping this place.", "date": "2010-10-07 18:19:27", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 142, "average_stars": 3.85, "yelping_since": "2008-01-22 01:49:36"}}
