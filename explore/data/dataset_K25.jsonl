Ricci's has been in business since 1920 and any business that can not only survive, but flourish after hitting a century mark, has to be doing something right. \n\nHoagies ate a Philadelphia staple and definitely a food of the working man. A hoagie allows someone to eat something substantial in a quick an efficient manner. You don't have to worry about a fork and knife to help you in eating it. I heard somewhere that a sandwich was a favorite amongst truckers because they could eat it while driving. I do not know about the authenticity of the story, but it makes sense. But I think what allowed hoagies (or subs, grinders, whatever you want to call them) to survive is that they also taste great.\n\nI can say that a hoagie is one of my favorite meals. It is a perfect culmination of bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, vinegar, oil and spices and has been embraced worldwide as a lunch (or donner) favorite. Ricci's do hoagies right and as it continues to get handed down through the generations, I hope that they continue to flourish.\n\nSo, after over a hundred years, the community still loves Ricci's and after eating here, you will understand why. My go-to hoagie has always been an Italian and they do their Italian right. It is a substantial meal at a fair price and it is something that you will return to Ricci's again and again for.\n\nAs Ricci's enters into their second century, they still produce an outstanding product. With them continuing to do so, I can see them making it another century and beyond.", "date": "2022-01-11 14:07:02", "user": {"name": "John", "review_count": 3148, "yelping_since": "2018-08-03 12:39:48", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 87}}, {"review_id": "b-pSMWmJdNVh7qnQf3AR4A", "user_id": "OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg", "business_id": "Bih0eT_lbbCUwKmGYpX0hw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "text": "Fantastic hoagies.

The eggplant appetizer was the best thing of the night, but was very small, comparable to a square of lasagna.  The grilled calamari was good too, well done with a fresh little salad.  Neither of the appetizers were very good for sharing though. All of the dishes were well done.  My veil cantaloni was good, the blush sauce tasted wonderful.  The birthday girl got the gnocchi Gorgonzola, that was just too heavy, it needed to be cut with something, she couldn't finish the dish and ended up eating mostly off of my plate.

Instead I ordered the soup of the day which was an 8 dollar bowl of bland and uninteresting lentil soup.  For 8 dollars they might want to look into a sausage and lentil option because I can't imagine anyone getting excited for the current version which is not dissimilar to a can of progresso. In addition to the lentil soup we also ordered the stuffed eggplant which was similar to one medium sized square of Eggplant lasagna again nothing to write home about.  The eggplant was over salted but it was almost a pleasant surprise in comparison to underseasoned lentil soup.\n\nMain Course\n\nMy girlfriend was so excited they had the sweet potato gnocchi on the menu this is one of her favorite dishes.  All I can say is it must have been an off night for the gnocchi because that was easily the worst gnocchi I've ever had.  It was so bland and the texture was so soft, it was kind of like eating gnocchi made from Elmer's glue absolutely terrible I have no idea what everyone is raving about.  I had the Veil Marsala which again was pretty bland.  The meat was nicely cooked but the sauce and pasta left loads to be desired.  \n\nDessert was a slice of chocolate ganache with whipped cream it was good but not the most creative dish \n\nI'd give this place 2 stars I wouldn't waste my time going back.

It certainly sounded like what we were hoping to find: a small local place with a unique feel that had good tortellini (it was my daughter's 10th birthday and that's one of her faves).\n\nSo I don't know. Maybe it's one of those places that has variable quality, that sometimes has a down night because the cook's girlfriend left him or bad weather made everyone perform poorly. If that's the case, the cook's girlfriend has been really really nice to him and the weather was great yesterday, so Hosteria da Elio really knocked it out of the park for us.\n\nThe front room here is very not impressive, but that's not what you should go for. When the weather is nice (and, to re-state my earlier... uh, statement, the weather was fantastically gorgeous last night), the back patio is the epitome of what you want a restaurant's outdoor dining area to be like. Beautiful plants, very serene, cozy, just fantastic. The wine was great, because of course it's BYOB and we had a very nice chardonnay and a cold Sierra Nevada. The service was great, not pushy or fast moving, but well paced for the evening.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the eggplant parmesan appetizer as well as a gorgonzola salad. Again, in comparison with some other reviews where people talked about not being able to find the eggplant in their eggplant parmesan, our experience could not have been more different. The eggplant was sliced amazingly thin, lightly breaded, then layered thickly into a two-inch thick chunk of meltingly tender delicious goodness. The best eggplant dish I've ever had except for one spicy eggplant dish I had at a now-defunct Chinese in Santa Cruz, CA.\n\nThe tortellini with white sauce was tortellini with white sauce, well executed with bits of prosciutto and really tasty fresh sweet peas, but not anywhere off the range, as it were. Which of course is just what a 10-year-old wants from her tortellini.\n\nMy wife had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was, hands down, the best gnocchi I've ever had. I should interject here, I've lived in Florida, San Francisco, and St. Louis, all of which have quality Italian food, and been to New York and Italy as well, so I've had lots of gnocchi, good gnocchi, and my wife's a huge fan. This stuff blew us both away. Absolutely fantastic. It melted in your mouth, no chewiness or elasticity at all, but full of flavor.\n\nFor my dinner, I had the veal cannelloni with blush sauce. I seldom eat veal (for the obvious reasons, but it's so tasty that I sometimes break down and have it), so when I do, I really want it to deliver. This cannelloni delivered. And how. I'm used to cannelloni basically being like a meatball wrapped in a crepe. That's OK: when done well, it's a very tasty meatball. But the minced or ground meat has usually solidified into a mostly coherent structure. Not in this one. The meat was very finely minced and mixed with herbs and fell apart once you took a bite of it.

We had a larger group reservation and they took us to their private back room dining room on the second floor. Walking through, I felt like royalty. It had strong lounge-feel vibes and the darker lighting and red decor theme gave me really high expectations. The dining room I believe is traditionally used for meetings because of the TV on the wall and board room-esque seating, but we were happy with the view.\n\nWe started the night with cocktails and also ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. This is where the night started to go downhill. The cocktails were not as good as people raved. My Ginger Kiss and my friends Comcastini tasted very watered-down and for lack of better words, cheap. Our stomachs started rumbling and we went right to ordering.\n\nI went with the pasta a la norma and got a large platter of antipasto misto for the table for appetizers. The wait time was noticeably long, about 25 minutes before we actually saw some food. I will say, the portions are huge. The pasta was sized like an entree and I was able to give multiple people at the table a good portion to taste. However, it was very simple, something I'm sure I could throw together in my own kitchen. The antipasto was also very pretty, but nothing special, just a bunch of meats and pickled veggies on a wooden platter.\n\nFor the second course, I got the wild black cod. This course was miserable. I still have no idea what it was, but there was something in the oil that the fish was fried in that gave it a very very undesirable aftertaste. It was similar to the effect of adding too much MSG, but my tongue wasn't tingling. It just felt like I was whiffing wafts of salty, spicy air. I couldn't take more than one bite a minute. The celery root puree was also strangely flavored. Both me and a friend noted it tasted very similar to cup noodle seasoning packets and it just wasn't impressive at all. The presentation was beautiful, but that's it.\n\nThe dessert was also not impressive. The flavor of the semifreddo was okay, but it was so frozen that it was hard to cut through and the berries in the middle were rock hard. Definitely not an ideal finish to the meal.\n\nAnother thing to note was the music. I noticed it right away as we were ordering drinks and all I could hear was, \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" The remainder of our night was accompanied with 70's and 80's pop music, which definitely wasn't fitting with the decor. \n\nFood was definitely not worth the price. Cocktails weren't amazing. Ambiance was awkward. I might come back for sips if I'm around, but that is about it.

EVER!!!!!!!\n\nMy wife and I have been here two times prior, and it had been good if not great.  Tonight, the food was laughably bad.  If you didn't laugh, you would cry because each course was somehow bad.  While eating my food, I thought to myself \"this food is on par with Chili's or TGIFriday's\".\n\nTable 31 reverse engineered restaurant week with the thought process of \"ok each person pays $35, how do we profit from that?\"\n\nFor our first courses, we ordered carpaccio and lasagna.  The lasagna was dry as it must have been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour or two.  It was on par with cafeteria lasagna.  As for the carpaccio, it was the coup de grace of the meal.  I would rate carpaccio as my top 10 favorite dishes.  In fact, my wife looked at all of the restaurant week participants and picked Table 31 as a surprise because she knows how much I love carpaccio!  I love the raw red meat, sliced so thinly that you can cut it with a fork.  \n\nThe waiter puts the carpaccio in front of me, and at first I thought that they forgot to put the carpaccio on my plate.  I realized that the carpaccio was white and blended into the plate.  It was plated with arugula, parmesan and a vinaigrette.  I am guessing it was pork, but honestly it tasted like turkey lunch meat.  The edge of the slices of meat were brown which meant to me that it was cooked somehow, and it tasted as if it was oven roasted.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  If someone gave me a plate of lunch meat and a salad, I may have preferred that over the carpaccio I had.\n\nNext, we ordered the oven roasted chicken, the eggplant parmesan and a side of meatballs.  My wife's chicken was actually pretty good.  My eggplant was piping hot.  I could not touch it for about 5 minutes.  After waiting for a while, I finally took a bite and it burned my mouth a little bit, so much so that it took me another 5 minutes to actually taste eggplant.  The meatballs had way too much garlic.\n\nFor the dessert, we had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and panna cotta.  The chocolate creme brulee stunk.  We didn't even finish it.  Who doesn't finish chocolate!  My wife actually said \"I mean, this doesn't taste good.  I feel like I am wasting calories by eating this.\"  With the panna cotta, it was ok not great.  The funniest thing about the whole meal was that on the panna cotta, they plated an assortment of fruits that were cut in half.  We got half a blueberry, not a full blueberry but a half a blueberry!  Who does that!  If the restaurant is too damn cheap to splurge on blueberries, then don't plate them!!!!!!  Oh and the blackberry was cut in half length wise, very weird.\n\nThis was probably the worst meal that I have eaten in Philadelphia in the 10 years that I have lived here.  And it cost me $150!  I am not that much of a foodie snob, but the meal was so bad that I was forced to create a yelp account to complain.\n\nPlease do not waste your time and money on Table 31.  There are so many great restaurants in Philly these days that are 1000x better than this place.\n\nIf you like:\n-Lunch meat and salads\n-Mouth burning food\n-Garlic\n-Wasted calories\n-Half of a blueberry\n\nThen by all means, don't let my review discourage you.", "date": "2012-10-12 01:17:07", "user": {"name": "Mark", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2012-10-12 00:47:24", "elite": "", "average_stars": 1.0, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "wmzYgWN3JkuhltwlcYvQUA", "user_id": "qb93lt68RXCsrmAc9AYJeQ", "business_id": "2BRbu3cBbH2bCgzN3DVc8w", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 7, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is such a joke. \n\nFirst of all, they are ridiculously overpriced. The quality of food varies from decent to well below average to being served cold black coffee.

Is that the actual restaurant policy? Last I checked, when your business is sitting around completely empty, and five people who were decent enough to make a reservation show up, you seat them with a smile, not a stop sign, regardless of what color shoes or pants they're wearing. Luckily the manager has half a brain and motioned that it was totally cool, but the pretentious hostess still felt the need to educate us on how to dress at a fine dining establishment. Clearly, she needed a way to feel important. Glad we could help.\n\nThe food was unfortunately pretty inconsistent. We had some decent appetizers and that was about as far as we got. The entrees were all over the place, some being completely offensive, others being decent, and the rest just showing some laziness in preparation.\n\nWe continually had to ask the waitress to come back to help us since she was focused on pandering for her tip at a table of old rich people. \n\nLater we were handed serving spoons for eating our desserts, which in retrospect, I wish I hadn't ordered because it was forgettable at best.\n\n\nDefinitely will not come back, and will also mention to others that it's not worth going to.", "date": "2012-10-01 00:30:30", "user": {"name": "Rizwan", "review_count": 199, "yelping_since": "2011-06-18 11:57:49", "elite": "2011,2012,2013,2014,2015", "average_stars": 2.93, "fans": 13}}, {"review_id": "KxAmnJFUGicKnlZ4j1de2w", "user_id": "5G2IF0VIN3Brl-m45QDXsA", "business_id": "2BRbu3cBbH2bCgzN3DVc8w", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "No more Insalata Funghi?

The waiter was ironically slow and despite our best efforts to eat and get the heck out of there, dinner still took an hour and a half.

The menu is extensive with many interesting Italian specialties. Only a seasoned chef can handle so many wonderful dishes on a daily basis! In most eateries a couple of these dishes would be offered only as the dinner special. So, we started with Polipo Fantasia which is grilled octopus with capers, pur\u00e9ed ceci beans and sun dried tomatoes, finished with olive oil and balsamic glaze. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the pur\u00e9ed chick beans was fabulous. Not a humus but a delicious dipping sauce. A second appetizer plate was Calamari Fritti which is traditional fried calamari but these were served in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. A really great mixtures of flavor between the sweet & spicy but adding to the explosion of flavor were the fried calamari. The calamari were crisp, tender and not chewy or greasy! The final appetizer plate was Antipasto which is Chef Tony's selection of an assortment of Italian specialty meats, cheese, and vegetables that included thinly sliced soppressata, salami, prosciutto, provolone, pecorino and mozzarella cheeses, pickled eggplant, roasted peppers, fresh and sundried tomatoes...yep another culinary delight! Some in our party had eaten here before and knew their go to pasta dish was Fettuccine Pugliese that's squid ink fettuccine with shrimp and crab meat, served in a cheese bowl with white wine sauce. I tried Gnocchi Mascarpone con Aragosta which is mascarpone gnocchi saut\u00e9ed with lobster and typically finished with a touch of tomato and cream, but I skipped the tomato and cream and the Chef accommodated my request for an arrabiata sauce. Each gnocchi was stuffed with a dab of mascarpone and cooked to perfection! For my taste the lobster in arrabiata sauce was heaven!

We ordered another special of the night that was even worse than our starter; the veal was gray, slathered with a white gelatinous sauce--a texture that suggested the sauce might have been canned.

I had been wanting to try this place since I heard about his pizza on One Bite Pizza Reviews. He started making pizza at home for friends and was shipping them out in the mail during Covid. He opened a brick and mortar store in November 2020 but I hadn't gotten Dowtown until today. After snagging a coveted spot on 3rd street, we made our way to the shop. The location is across from Sonny's on Market. The decor and signage is great and features what you came for ......Pizza! Not just any pizza, excellent pizza!\nAngelo Pizza (Yeah, that is the owner's name) is creating artisan pies that are incredible and as advertised.\nMeeting Angelo himself, at the register, was a treat. You can tell how passionate he is about what he does in the quality of the product and how personable he is to his customers. We went with two selections...The Angelo Pizza and The Not Pepperoni Pizza. My wife is more of a purist so the Angelo was her pick. It was fantastic! Great blend of cheese, the right amount of sauce and thin, crispy crust. It is a spectacular straight up cheese pizza that will have you eating slice after slice until it is all gone! For my choice, The Not Pepperoni, there was no doubt you would never go back to pepperoni again. It was covered with soppressata and roasted red peppers. Both combine on an already perfect pie to create the right amount of spice with the cheese blend. It really is an epiphany if you have never had sopressata before on your pizza! The dough and it's perfect crust are really the flavor base that have you eating slice after slice.  One other touch with each pizza is a whole, hot cherry pepper. These add a great flavor note to the pizza as well!\nSorry if I did not take any pizza pictures! We were too busy eating it. \nDo yourself a favor, go and get this pizza.

From escarole soup to steak and lobster. They also have a very enticing dessert tray! I tried the veal piccante. It was very tender and tasted quite lovely. We also tried the langostinas, they were on the specials menu. Also very well prepared, presented, and delicious. All the main dishes are a la carte. Sides include sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, sauteed escarole, and there was also a brussel sprout side added. There are two bars, one upstairs and one on the main dining area as you walk in. The bars are beautiful and well stocked.  They have a decent wine and cocktail menu.  I decided to try the Vesper, it was very good! \nWhat's changed? The price of food here is very high! Too high for the area, the type of cuisine (Italian), and for a casual restaurant not known for great cuisine made by well known chefs. There are many top restaurants in the city with comparable pricing, or lower. It would be quite a challenge to dine here again simply based on the very high priced items.  Please take this into consideration! \nBread.  Not good at all! Our bread came out in a small basket and was frozen in the center. Appeared to have been warmed up very quickly. It was not fresh or tasty.  In fact, this almost ruined my appetite.  I didn't mention this to the server because I had already decided this was not typical or satisfactory; and I didn't really need to eat bread that badly anyway. \nComplementary parking.  They have a couple lots to park at.  They were both full.  However there is a valet that will park your car. He will let you know he works for tips. Be good to him. I would recommend taking a taxi, Uber/Lyft to the restaurant..  It would save you time and the aggravation of driving around trying to find a parking space, or tipping the friendly valet. \nSaloon has beautiful old world decor.  Lots of beautiful carved wood and nice artwork throughout.  To be quite frank, it's a little too busy.  The restaurant is very clean.  The service was very good! Everyone here is well dressed and appeared to enjoy doing their job.  They were very welcoming from entering and leaving. \nOverall, Saloon was a disappointment, despite being a traditional South Philly landmark. I was not happy with the prices here at all. Especially since it was a la carte. I probably won't come back, but I feel you should at least give it a try, take your chances. Be prepared to spend at least $70 or more per person.

This was on the special and I highly recommend ordering it! \n\nMy mom ordered the Spaghetti alla scoglio. Very generous portion with seafood and the white wine sauce was light that it made eating this so easy. There was a tiny kick in this dish. 9/10. I ordered one of the specials, which was grilled swordfish w/calamari and shrimp, potato and zucchini. Extremely tender and fresh. Cooked perfectly and I have zero complaints. A lighter and healthier meal, and extremely filling 9/10\n\nThe star of the show was my dads entree, which was another special. He ordered the lamb osso bucco and wow *chefs kiss! The pasta was handmade and absolute perfection. Meat was tender and fell off the bone. The red sauce was not extremely strong, but also not weak. Had the perfect balance with a lot of flavor. This was 11/10 amazing! \n\nFor dessert, we all shared the tiramisu. This was the only dish that was just okay. Flavor was all there but the cream was frozen. We thought it was ice cream at first.

We had the tasting menu, and there certainly were some highlights. We ordered the Stuzzichini with the prosciutto and coppa.

These little pieces of fried bread had an unpleasant texture.\n\nThe Sweet Onion Crepe was the best thing I ate all evening. It had the purest distillation of amazing caramelized onion flavor that I have ever experience. I would order this again in a heartbeat. I also tried the Swordfish Braciole, which was delicious.\n\nThe Gnocchi was another highlight. The potato-less dumplings had the most beautiful texture, and the brown butter sauce lent the gnocchi a richness that was amazing. I was less pleased with the Spaghetti Alla Chitarra. Overall, I found that the sauce lacked flavor, and I would not reorder this pasta.\n\nMy husband and I split the Veal Milanese. While it was an excellent cut of veal and had some truly beautiful heirloom tomatoes, I felt this dish lacked flavor as well. \n\nBoth desserts that we tried were outstanding.

Our servers made wonderful recommendations, topped off our wine often, and brought us extra goodies throughout the evening. Note: Service is not fast, it is intentionally relaxed and spaced out so you can enjoy yourself.

It's definitely not a large space, but they've made the most of it.  I didn't feel crowded at our table as there is plenty of space between tables so everyone has some privacy. But tables were close enough so we could see people's food as it was being brought out to their tables, which we enjoyed. Lighting was low, but not too low, the bathroom was exceptionally clean, the dishes and glasses all beautiful and charming. \n\nFood: They offer a structured menu from which you choose one option among many for each course. Every single thing I ordered was amazing! From the savory caramelized onion crepe with truffle, to the locally foraged mushroom ragu pasta, to the veal Milanese, to the pistachio cake with strawberry ice cream, every dish was exquisite.

After checking out the RW menu online, and comparing it to a few others that I thought were worth checking out, friends and I decided that Alice Pizza was the spot for us. Two out of three of us had been for pizza and gelato before, but this was a first for the sit down, full menu dining experience. We called about a week in advance to make our reservation and were easily able to get the time we wanted.\n\nWe were seated immediately upon arrival and our vaccination cards were checked per the city mandate. We were offered regular and RW menus. As a participant in dry January, I only peeked at the drink menu to avoid temptation. I was pleased to see that the drink prices are pretty reasonable and there's a wide selection of cocktails, beer, and wine. I opted for a diet coke with lemon, another friend participating had a blood orange italian soda, and our non-dry January friend had an espresso martini.\n\nThe four course RW menu had 4 different choices for first course and the second course, so we all agreed upon our three preferences from each category and ordered accordingly. We each did our own thing for course 3, and then shared desserts for the fourth and final course.\n\nTo start, we had the Mozzarella Tasting, Salumi e Formagi Misti, and Burrata Con Tartufo. The servings were small, but just enough so that we could each have a bite of everything. For our second course, we had the Cacio e Pepe Gnocchi Fritti, Suppli al Telefono, and Sformato. Again, these dishes were on the smaller side, but perfect to share. The gnocchi was incredible, the ragu with the suppli was perfect, and the sformato was next level - definitely my favorite.\n\nFor my third course, I had the Carbonara pizza. This was the main event dish, the portion was so big I could hardly finish half. So crisp, well topped, minimal crust and just delicious. My mouth is watering while writing this review and thinking about that pizza. \n\nTo wrap up the evening, we had the Sfogliatelle, Tortina Della Nonna, and Crema Catalana. Honestly, I think we were served a key lime pie instead of the Tortina Della Nonna because there was a lime garnish and no nut toppings but I am so glad because that little pie was my favorite dessert.\n\nStart to finish, a delightful night. Our server Dom was personable, attentive, and made the evening thoroughly enjoyable. I can't wait to return to Alice for another sit down meal to try all of the other menu options.

Originally developed in Rome, Alice Pizza has expanded worldwide and is now a heavy-hitter in the pizza al taglio game. A friend remarked that this spot was a regular spot in her culinary routine during her semester abroad in Rome, so it's about time that I tried the Center City outpost.\n\nThe decor is confusingly over-the-top and in slight disrepair. Funky wire lighting fixtures hang from the high ceilings, and the walls prominently display murals and paintings depicting scenes from Rome. The large space is dominated by a U-shaped center counter. A rainbow of gelato options highlights the front side, with a long row of assorted square pies along the left and a full-service bar on the right. Mismatched chairs are paired with Mod Podge-esque tables. Contemporary rock blends with the buzz from the kitchen.\n\nMy partner and I decided to split a few slices during our visit this past weekend. Ordering in-person was a breeze, and the slices were reheated within 5 minutes.\n\nThe crust itself was pleasantly light and crisp. Each slice had a generous helping of clearly premium toppings. I loved that sauce and toppings spread very nearly to the edges of the crust. Our favorites flavors were the Diavolo (spicy salami), Philly Special (pesto, arugula, and sundried tomatoes), and Salsiccia e Funghi (sausage and mushrooms). The only flavor that was a letdown for us was the Melenzane Picante (eggplant), which was lukewarm, slightly slimy, and overly oily, and one-dimensional.\n\nOur eyes were definitely larger than our stomachs -- we ended up getting 6 rectangular slices (translating into 12 square-sized ones). I would recommend 2-3 rectangular slices per person for a solid meal. Nonetheless, the $30 (after tax and tip) for our meal was still a bit jarring for pizza. All being said, Alice offers some of Philly's best reheated slices, which can inherently be inconsistent.", "date": "2021-09-12 21:37:52", "user": {"name": "Austin", "review_count": 211, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 22:23:33", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.08, "fans": 25}}, {"review_id": "LTAifJ3kBuFXlqR7D4STxg", "user_id": "G-DzOxoh7tniSa5K7apy-g", "business_id": "VSDdUwXktnvL_O0meKv7MQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Not quite the same pizza al taglio in Rome.

But Alice has nailed it. Alice describes itself as having evolved from Roma pizzerias and I would agree. In Rome I was always amazed at the different topping varieties with lots of vegetables as opposed to the meat laden US renditions, and this is exactly how Alice has designed it's offerings. I actually wanted a full meal so ordered a personal pizza (Diablo's with added spinach) and the Fior Latte Mozzarella Caprese with added Prosciutto. Portions are very generous for the price and the pizza was glorious just like what I'd expect in Italy. I have not even had pizza like this in NYC or Boston (which I have always found weird because of the storied Italian influence in these cities). My review is only 3-stars for the following reasons - the Caprese \"heirloom tomatoes\" were not even close to meeting my expectations and they put too much sea salt on but not enough EVOO or oregano. Remember mozzarella is already a salty cheese so overdoing the added sea salt was just too much. Lastly, I ordered the added Prosciutto to the caprese and paid an up charge of $5.50 for it, but it wasn't added to the dish. VERY disappointing. Because I obtained this meal as take-away I didn't notice until I had arrived back at the hotel. For the charge, this is totally unsatisfactory. In hind-sight the added saltiness of the meat would have been completely overwhelming in light of my comment about the excessive sea salt. Finally, when I called in to order my food, the server didn't understand the menu and I had to educate her that, yes in fact they do have a caprese on the menu. How can someone working in a restaurant not know the menu? Really?\nIn summary, the pizza was awesome, the caprese was not worth it in the end. This would be an awesome spot for a walk-in and walk-away lunch - get your pizza, fold it in half and indulge as you walk down the streets of Philadelphia and for a minute believe you are in the streets of Roma.", "date": "2021-08-13 09:22:55", "user": {"name": "Eric", "review_count": 80, "yelping_since": "2016-12-21 07:57:37", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.81, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "EhU8pUGM3FNPKFO2xxETSQ", "user_id": "Oumcr7bl4Jg8WVlkWb9y-g", "business_id": "VSDdUwXktnvL_O0meKv7MQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The pizza was amazing!

Greens, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, but I added some calamari which upped the game, and the dressing they kept to the side. However, the gigantic sphere of a meatball with a huge amount of ricotta and red sauce was almost a meal in itself. Perfectly cooked with an almost crispy outer rim, juicy inside and so much flavor. Mixed with the ricotta was perfect. I was not the biggest fan of the red sauce, but everyone has their preferences. \n\nThe fried calamari came back to work a little on the soggy side, and they were too salty for me. Next time I'll try at the restaurant itself and I bet they'll be better. Most of that came home for someone else in the family to enjoy.\n\nLastly, dessert was so decadent. The zeppoles were perfectly fried dough balls in powdered sugar with an outstanding cannoli cream over them. Then, to somehow make them even better, a raspberry dipping sauce. OMG. \n\nMy coworker really liked her chicken Caesar salad that she added bacon to. Couldn't finish it but did chow down on the nice grilled chicken. Had to save room for the zeppoles! \n\nLaScala's Fire also looked awesome inside in gleaming white and has plenty of seating. The staff were using all COVID-19 precautions. We inquired about a luncheon and they said they are taking things day by day as the rules seem to change by the second in Philadelphia. However, they can accommodate.\n\nThe online ordering menu allows for a tip to be added, and you pay with credit. $67 for everything including tax and tip - 2 salads, soup, calamari, and zeppoles!

At one time, it was a go-to restaurant for me. The atmosphere, food, and service was great. Now, I'm giving 1 star for service, and 1 star for the apps. What's good... the service. Our waiter was Kenardi, and LaScala's is lucky to have him. He's the only reason the experience didn't end up being a disaster. He's very attentive and friendly. The food... The bread and oil dip is excellent. The appetizers we had was pretty good (White Pear Pizza, especially ) and Im glad because we sent back 2 entrees. Both were chicken pasta dishes. The chicken was literally boiled in water and thrown on top of noodles, it was absolutely flavorless, the sauce was just as bad... it was like eating cardboard topped with chalk. Both dishes were really terrible. I couldn't even dress it up. Use the seasoning rack, dammit! The atmosphere is confusing. They have candles lit on all the tables, but what mood is that setting when your customers under lights bright enough for a broadway show. Also, they don't pay attention to seating. The restaurant was pretty empty, so sitting adult parties next a table with 3 screaming kids wasn't very thoughtful. I think it's unfortunate the way LaScala's has changed. It's not hard to get it right, you just have to pay attention, and put the effort in. Prior to this visit, it has been a long time. I'm not gonna say I'll never go back, because I'm really hoping this was just a bad night, and I can still count on one of my old favorite restaurants.

The women who were working told us we could put in appetizer orders right away (normal, right? Appetizers is how you start the meal, why not put those in first?). But the waiter (Mark?) was adamant that entres and appetizers had to be in at the same time.

We didn't have a reservation, but thought we would just walk there and see if we could eat. The hostess gave us in our opinion the best seat in the house, a little table right next to the open window wall. She told us we needed to be done in 45 minutes because that's when the next reservation for that table began. We tend to eat fast, so that was no problem for us! This place is very small and cozy, with dim lighting. It's a nice date spot! Our waitress was great to begin with, but forgot about us after our food was brought out. We decided to order 2 pizzas and share them. My husband ordered the spicy sausage and had the caramelized onions omitted on his half. I ordered the spicy soppressata and he asked for the honey to be omitted on his half. I appreciate them allowing you to make small alterations, and not pulling the \"chef created this to perfection\" card. Each pizza was $17, which seems about right for the quality and charm of the place! Our pizza was brought out in under 10 minutes! A food runner brought the pizza, not our waitress and we were out of water and it was clear after 6-7 minutes she wasn't coming back anytime soon, so we had to ask another waitress for a water refill. She must have told our waitress because she cane back with water and apologized. After she apologized, we were fine, didn't hold a grudge. Our pizza was so delicious! The pepperoni was so crispy and paired perfectly with the honey! My husband's sausage pizza was also very good! I felt like it was missing acidic and textural elements though. It needed a little lemon or vinegar and something on top for a little crunch. But overall, very excellent! We finished in about 35 minutes and we're just waiting for our waitress to come back so we could ask for a box and the check. She finally came back after another 7 minutes. We were getting nervous because we didn't want to screw over the hostess who let us take the table. When she brought the bill we had our card out and ready for her to take. By the time she brought it back, we had gone over the 45 minutes. There aren't very many tables, this place is very small and they seemed to have a handful of waitress/waiters in addition to food runners, so we're not sure what caused our waitress to be aloof after we ordered.

Most are priced between $3-$4. I got three different ones to go. While they were all delicious, my favorite was the Colombian, a rich chocolate mousse with a little creme center with a layer of almond cake underneath, and then the whole thing was coated with a thin dark chocolate shell. My second favorite was a round pastry coated with hazelnuts with a Russian sounding name. The inside was a dense hazelnut cake. It was not very sweet at all. The Paris Brest was not a bad choice either with a thick layer of praline cream sandwiched between two light round pastry layers. \n\nThe total for those three pastries was $10.55. They also packaged them up nicely in a large take out container so we got them home in mint condition. The eat in area is really nice looking though, so this is definitely a place where you can relax and enjoy some coffee or tea and a nice pastry.

In 2017, are we really denying pregnant women access to public restrooms? And at a Starbucks no less?\n\nMy wife is 30 weeks pregnant and was seeking relief after a fair amount of eating, drinking, and walking along South Street.\n\nShe walked into the Starbucks at around 8:00pm and asked for a venti cup of ice water and the restroom key. The barista (a white male) told her restrooms were for paying customers only. She showed her belly and explained that being pregnant she really needed to use the restroom and he told her there was nothing he could do because it was store policy.\n\nMy wife walked out visibly shaken and told me what happened. I walked in with her and asked for clarification about the store policy. I've never known any other Starbucks to do this. I was told by the same barista that there was nothing they could do and they reiterated the store policy, saying it was a \"Philly Starbucks policy\".\n\nI told them that was ridiculous and asked if corporate was aware. Another employee (a white female) stepped up and told me that the reason they have this policy in place is because it is a \"safety issue\". My wife and I looked at her perplexed, so she continued explaining, saying that they let people use the bathroom and they end up shooting heroin and there's been an uptick in crime.\n\nThis made me livid... I asked if she really thinks my pregnant wife is coming in their bathroom to shoot heroin and she just kept repeating it's a safety issue.\n\nFed up, I said that I would be calling corporate to complain. She laughed and said I could go ahead and call corporate because they are the ones who made the policy and give them direction. I asked her for her name and she said she was not required to give it to me. I asked the other two employees and they also refused to give me their name saying they are not required to do so.\n\nFrustrated, I said, that I would take a venti Cafe mocha and the restroom key. I figured policy aside, my wife needed to use the bathroom so I'll just buy something. The female employee said that she is choosing to refuse me service and that I need to leave the store or she would call the police.\n\nShocked by her brash reactions and the fact that the other two staff seemed to think this entire exchange was funny, I said this whole thing was crazy and headed out the door. As I was walking out, the female employee cursed at me saying, \"have a great f'ing day\". I walked back in and asked what she said and she kept threatening to call the police if I didn't leave. I took out my phone and snapped a picture of them (see attached).\n\nI called corporate to complain about the situation and they indicated they would follow up with me. \n\nAll in all, I am incredibly disappointed in this particular location and the workers here. They were rude, condescending, and took every opportunity to insult and demean us. And given that the three employees and the few customers in the store at the time were all white and we are black, l can't help but conclude that race played a factor here.\n\nWe spend entirely too much money on a daily basis at Starbucks to warrant this kind of treatment. And given their location on South Street (which gets busy at times), I can understand a customers-only policy, but they should consider expanding that to pregnant women and also people who are regular Starbucks customers. They should also evaluate individual circumstances and make informed, solutions-oriented decisions. \n\nVery disappointed.

Grubhub has been trying now for almost 2 hours to get a hold of them for a refund, but they're refusing to answer the phone. I've ordered from them nearing a dozen times, and this experience has completely ruined all the rest. Late, rotten food, then ghosting on customers... I'll never order from them again.\n\nUpdate: After two days, Grubhub finally got a hold of them but they're refusing to do anything. So I called myself and the manager was so unbelievably rude and started yelling at me, not letting me speak. I was told that my brown smoothie ended up that way because the driver took too long to get there. Sorry, but fruit doesn't brown quite that quickly. I've waited an hour for their food before and all that happened was the smoothie separated. This was brown... But instead of trying to help, I was yelled at. They had a chance to redeem themselves and passed on it.", "date": "2019-02-28 16:07:07", "user": {"name": "Erika", "review_count": 23, "yelping_since": "2010-03-26 09:33:09", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.33, "fans": 2}}, {"review_id": "TPYyvy5XFbQB_gTlSzMvYg", "user_id": "LM7vR9JdE03zGH-Er3zZ7g", "business_id": "bchZXVE4feVx4Q5rhIRCGg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I absolutely love this place!

The owner told us that because they were busy inside, their website ordering was pushed back. \n\nHe then explained that our food was incorrect and she told him he was lying. Why would a grown person call an establishment that they tend to frequent to lie about their service?

The Uber driver was there to pick up her orders and this worker did not care!

I've really never had an issue before, but this Cosi was the exception.\n\nI work right around the corner so I went there today for the first time for a quick bite. I entered the store and was greeted by a sign that said Salads to the right, Sandwiches to the left. I was confused because at every other Cosi I've been to you just order at the register and they bring the food to the table. I was also ordering a Taste two (half salad+half sandwich) so I wasn't sure which line to get in. I decided on the salad line because it seemed like the logical progression of the line to the register. \n\nI get to the front of the line and the guy asks me what I want. I told him I wanted the taste two with a Signature Salad and a Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwich. Without looking at me he asks \"White or wheat\"? I had no idea he was talking to me and I could hardly hear because it was loud. When I didn't answer he yelled at me and was extremely rude. When I told him what I wanted he went over to the sandwich people and told them my sandwich order. He then told me to slide down to the other side and wait for my sandwich.\n\nI noticed that everyone else in line got an order slip to bring up to the register. I got nothing, but I assumed the sandwich people would give me one when they were finished making other people's orders. I was standing there waiting while three more people ordered and received their sandwiches and eventually I thought there was no way it was taking them that long to make my order. After standing there for about 7 minutes I asked the lady if someone was making mine and she said the guy in the back was. Well I noticed he was making a full sized sandwich and I ordered a half size. I notified her of this, and she asked me if I ever got an order slip. I said no. She wrote one up for me and told me I could go pay at the register and they would bring me my sandwich. \n\nI figured they would just give me the whole sandwich that they had already made to make up for the fact that I had been waiting for so long (which they never really acknowledged even though I was waiting directly in front of the counter AND the manager walked past several times). They gave me a half sandwich anyway. What did they do? Cut the sandwich in half and throw out the rest? Make a whole new sandwich? They never even asked if my order was for there or to go. I wanted to eat in house but they wrapped everything up and didn't give me a tray.\n\nWhen I finally sat down, I opened my salad and it was pretty lacking. Whenever I've eaten at cosi the salad is usually very sizable with the lettuce piled above the rim of the bowl. Since they had given me a lid (because they never asked if I was eating there or to go) there was hardly any lettuce, and what was there was absolutely DRENCHED in dressing. I'm talking, when I was finished eating, there was at least a centimeter of dressing remaining at the bottom of the bowl. They also gave me white bread when I had ordered wheat.\n\nI gave it two stars because, besides the bread being wrong, my Sandwich was ok. I had never had that particular sandwich from Cosi before so I have nothing to compare it to, but for what its worth I liked it. I'll be fair.\n\nThis is the first Cosi I have been to for a few months, so I have no idea if Cosi just changed their ordering layout or if this particular location is one of the only ones that does it this way. It was completely unorganized and prone to error. I will not be returning to this Cosi location which is a shame, because it is the closest one to my work and I really do enjoy Cosi's food.

Seriously, the food here is so filling and amazing that the price is entirely justified. My friend got the beef + seafood option, and they were quite pleased with both the quantity and the quality of the meats. Finally, the octopus - it was so perfectly cooked, but just a bit too salty.

Once paid you will get a number to place on your table. With this number system I'm not sure if it was for the staff to bring you your food or for you to pickup once your food is ready. I saw both scenarios happening when I was there. \n\nThe menu:\n-The menu is substantive and has many options for different dietary restrictions. \n-There are a few parts of the menu which are confusing since they seem similar with other menu items, however the person behind the counter was able to clarify easily for us. \n-We noticed this after, but there is a printed menu available at the counter, not only the one above the counter as we had thought.\n-There is signage at the counter indicating that due to rising costs, all prices will be increased by 5% from what is stated. However checking in on Yelp yields a 5% off purchase coupon.\n\nFood:\n-The portions are huge and easily shared\n-The pita is made to order and very delicious \n-Everyone in the group enjoyed their order.\n-The bakery's menu looked delicious but sadly most items were out of stock. \n\nWith all the positives listed above, you may be wondering why the three star review.  The bathroom was absolutely filthy and disgusting. I am hoping it's due to a fluke but it was bad enough to dock a star. Upon future visits If the situation improves I will update my review. \n\nAdditionally the whole numbering system is frankly confusing. Some of us had our food brought to us. Others had to keep looking at the area where food that was ready to see if our order was there.  The restaurant was not busy so we were unsure what the deal was. This resulted in loss of a star since the last person in our group to get their food, where the rest of the group was already midway through theirs. This resulted in the loss of another star. \n\nOverall I would give Manakeesh another chance and also would love to try their bakery. I hope they take the feedback and address it. \n\nThings to know:\n-It will be easier to look and order off printed menu versus one displayed above counter\n-Indoor and outdoor seating available\n-Pay attention to food that is ready to be served, your order may be stuck there if you are waiting for it to be brought to you \n-Guest WiFi available \n-Come prepared with hand sanitizer to wash your hands versus using the bathroom. And do your best to avoid having to use the restaurant restroom. You will thank me later. \n-Cutlery, napkins, and water are self served.  However the water cups are TINY (like 4 sips) so be prepared to refill often or (what I recommend) bring your own refillable water bottle/cup. \n-Street parking only\n-There is a small section stocked with different items such as honey, Turkish delight, nuts, candy, etc. \n-Manakeesh has their own app for you to place delivery orders and get discounts from", "date": "2021-06-26 12:37:04", "user": {"name": "Manta", "review_count": 71, "yelping_since": "2010-05-04 22:47:11", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.78, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "EzCPE43WMBBBO9ZITcJBXw", "user_id": "pJ35nordG8JE59FBRoyTfQ", "business_id": "irXywqvfXj9maLLOBQMYvg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Comfortable space, delicious food, great tea and snacks.

I've seen days where people will simply come to work, other days where it's bubbling with conversation, other days a mix. Great for catching up with friends, dates, or just getting some work done on your own (with their free wifi)! \n\nService: Highlight of coming to this cafe - the employees are very kind and friendly! I was super indecisive between soups, and was offered a free sample of one.\n \nFood: Their soups will change, but I love their chicken + peanut soup. It was a bit on the oily side, but carried a lot of flavor. When I had a head cold, this really hit the spot! Coffee - they offer almond and soy milk at no additional cost (very rare for a coffee shop), and their special drinks are delicious! The latte I had was a bit diluted though, so I'll stick with their seasonal drinks in the future.\n\nRecommended Must-Try: Sugar plum drink - not too sweet, but delicious blend of vanilla into your coffee! I also have yet to get a soup I haven't liked - quite affordable ($6.50 for 16oz) and flavorful. A tad on the oily side sometimes, but I'm still obsessed. \n \nOverall: 4.5/5 - I love coming to this cafe.

Nothing in Michigan came close to the authentic Italian food that they served. When relatives were in town from Michigan we took them here and they agreed, this place was amazing. This place was the best until they changed the menu. They used to serve fresh bread from their oven that was literally worth the trip itself, now they serve bread that you can pick up at shoprite. The menu has been downsized to such a miniscule variety of the same themed food that its redundant to even try new things here. It seems like the menu has been downsized to reduce costs but from the reviews here it seems like it has also reduced appeal. They had a \"build your own\" pasta menu that had more variety than their entire menu does now. The portions are smaller now, there are fewer choices now, the price has gone up, but the service remains decent. The staff is friendly but they went from serving \"grandma's house\" to chef boyarde. Go here if you have never had decent Italian food and you will have a somewhat pleasant experience. Don't go here if you went here 2 years ago and loved it, it will ruin your opinion of this place. I'm giving it 2 stars for the memories and the service (after all I have been here literally about 30 times). My wife grew up in philly, she can make me the food that they now serve here.

I ordered this item as I have a dairy allergy and was excited to see a pizza that I didn't have to ask to be modified in order to be dairy free. Both on their menu and on Uber eats it explicitly states that this pizza does not contain cheese.\n\nSo I get my pizza in a timely manner from Uber Eats, and when I open the box, what do I see? A pizza with ONLY cheese, peppers, and onions. There was not even sauce on the pizza and it did not contain any of the other toppings that were stated on the menu... I also received the actual A Tutti receipt and it stated the correct order, so I am very unsure how such a big mixup happened.\n\nI call the restaurant and they state that they will remake the pizza and have their delivery person deliver it to me as soon as possible. She stated that the driver will call me when he arrives at my apartment. So I wait for about 40 min and then TRY calling the restaurant back to ask what the ETA is. However, now their phone is not working. I had to call about 10 times for about 15 min before I can get through to the restaurant. When I finally get through, they state that they have been waiting for me to call back, because they were unable to get my address from Uber Eats. So I give it to them, and they state that it should be delivered soon.\n\nAnother 30 min go by and I have still not received my pizza or heard from the restaurant so I call back again, but of course it takes another 10 min of calling to get through. When I finally do they state that the driver is out making other deliveries, and if he was not back in 5 min that they would call the driver and then call me when the driver was on the way to my apartment. So after ANOTHER 30 min I try calling the restaurant, and \"surprisingly\" cannot  get through so I decide to get in my car and drive to the restaurant. As soon as I get there, I get a call from the delivery guy that he is at my apartment. I had not received a call from the restaurant stating he was on his way as promised.\n\nI go into the restaurant hoping to speak with the manager. I told the woman that had been answering the phone that I was expecting a refund seeing as it took all-in-all almost 3 hours to get the correct order delivered from the time I ordered it on Uber Eats until the time I got the pizza. She told me that when the manager was not busy, he would call Uber Eats to get my refund, so we will see if that happens. Also, I was obviously frustrated and upset with this whole situation, and this woman at the counter was giving ME attitude. \n\nSo now I am sitting here eating the pizza, and it is soggy, tasteless, and obviously very cold.

I had previously given A Tutti 3/5 based on a dinner service, and I recently attempted to give them another shot which revealed to me that I was mistaken in my 3-star judgment: let's bump that down to 1-star and dive into the lambasting, shall we?\n\nThe entire point of the hospitality service is just that: to provide guests with a good experience and to make them feel welcome. This was the total opposite of my most recent - and definitely last experience - at A Tutti. I want so badly to have a good pasta restaurant near my house, so I decided to give them another shot, and boy did I regret it! My friend and I ordered a salad on focaccia, and pasta and meatballs. Pretty standard fare for an Italian place, right?\n\nMy food - the pasta and meatballs - came out of the kitchen pretty quickly. Notably absent was a salad, which seemed odd since normally Caesar salads are pretty quick to prepare, right? We waited about 10 minutes in the absence of the aforementioned salad - and our waiter - so I decided to take things into my own hands and beckoned over who appeared to be the owner (I believe his name is Paul). Upon learning that we were missing a salad (read: on focaccia), he retreated to the kitchen to presumably fix this problem. \n\nA few minutes later, the salad, devoid of focaccia - Paul in tow - sauntered over to our table. Our waiter joined Paul in delivering this incorrect dish to us with a smug expression on his face, and remarked, \"It's all Paul's fault!\"\n\nIn response to our evident displeasure, Paul asked, \"Was this supposed to be on focaccia?\" To our great dismay - and I can't make this up - after we affirmed his query he responded with, \"Oh well! I'll take it off the bill.\" (Said in reference to the additional charge of the focaccia NOT the whole salad.) What? He did not even offer to fix the dish that was wrongfully prepared. Just an \"Oh well.\"\n\nThis was such a backwards experience, all in the pursuit of truly mediocre pasta. The cacio e pepe I received this time was as awful as ever, the salty punch of pecorino was nowhere to be found and instead was replaced by an acrid, plasticky pre-ground black pepper flavor. \n\nI will absolutely not be giving them a third chance, and I most definitely hope this review saves some other poor souls from sharing a similar experience. Go in grace, friends.\n\n-- \n\nI have been dying to go to A Tutti for a while now because I'm very eager to find an Italian restaurant it's great pasta near me. Unfortunately, I was let down by the pasta at A Tutti, but everything else was pretty good and I like the energy of the place, so I do want to go back and try again.\n\nService: Our server Sarah was great. She was super friendly and gave us good advice throughout the meal.\n\nAmbiance: I felt like I was in a little trattoria in Italy. Very authentic vibe with big band and swing music playing which further transported me out of Roxborough and into another time. We were immediately greeted warmly like family when we walked in, and I couldn't stop smiling after that. \n\nFood: Definitely some stuff that can be worked on, here. I will start with my sad pasta, cacio e pepe, which was bland, gummy (overcooked & stuck together), and truly unpleasant to eat. It had none of the sharpness I would expect from a dish which is supposed to primarily consist of Pecorino Romano, and I really couldn't even eat it. We also got the carbonara, which tasted good, but the egg was hugely scrambled (GIANT pieces of scrambled egg) and was a far cry from the luxurious, rich sauce you expect from this dish. I am not sure if we just got a bad night on the pasta front or if they need to tweak their recipes, but this was definitely a letdown.\n\nWe also got pizza, flatbread, tomato soup, and meatballs. All of this was awesome and tasted very authentic. The pizza was crispy - I love the dough - and had bright, tomatoey sauce with sweet, chewy cheese. The flatbread was made from the same dough and delivered crispy, herbal rosemary perfectly. The tomato soup was exquisite and was particularly tasty with the breads dipped into it! Finally, I was happy with the meatballs, which came out steaming and covered in tomato sauce.\n\nOverall, there were some misses this night, but I liked the good food and the atmosphere so much that I definitely want to return.

Our server, I believe his name was Dan, was attentive and a super cool guy. We were disappointed at first because the restaurant was out of a couple items that we wanted to order, such as the calamari and some of the ingredients that come in the Pasta alle Cipolle. However, when Dan brought out the focaccia all of our doubts about the restaurant faded. It was baked to perfection and we loved all of the rosemary and spices on it. Also, Dan and the cook told us that they can whip up a special pasta dish with the ingredients they did have in the kitchen. We really appreciated the accommodation and the pasta was great!

We both commented about its deliciousness. We started with a ceasar salad that was slightly underdressed, but I would much rather have underdressed than overdressed, dripping in dressing. The greens were fresh and crunchy however and the salad complimented the pizza perfectly. This place also offers a good happy hour.

I also had the chance to try my friend's mussels (he ordered the white mussels). After talking about it, we agreed the mussels were decent but nothing to really rave about .\n- The lobster mac & cheese was delicious. The first couple of bites were great but as I worked through my meal, I began to notice the combo was saltier than I would have liked. \n- Sorbet - I wasn't particularly impressed by the sorbet. In fact, it was a bit too sweet/processed so I chose not to finish the whole thing (first bites are great - then too much sugar for my taste). For context - I have a BIG sweet tooth but get turned off if something is way too sweet #balance. \n\nService - 3/5 - Our waiter was kind and attentive to our large group. \n\nNoise level - 5/10 - I consider the noise level here average for dinner at a non-small restaurant. \n\nDecor/Ambiance 2/5 - \n - With it's white leather seats and bright purple lights, the decor gave me the impression of a lounge/club rather than a restaurant only place. In addition, restaurant branding is unclear.

We get to the restaurant (empty, but 1 other table) and are seated, where we remain for nearly 10 minutes without word from our server. She arrives, only to inform us that only a select few of the beers on draft are happy hour--unlike the website, which says all draft beers. We place our food orders and she is not seen nor heard from for another 20 mins. The bartender brings us our drinks. My boyfriend's beer tastes like soap. The other table leaves. It is nearly 7.

We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant but were told they were completely booked up but we could try the bar. That happens, but I checked OpenTable and was able to make an immediate reservation...and literally all time slots were available online. Hm. Then when I showed the hostess this, she sat us in a back room, again saying there were too many reservations for us to be able to sit in the area where we could take advantage of happy hour (apparently only the bar and area behind/ to the right of the bar). When we said we'd just leave, she did seat us in the happy hour area after all. \n\nNeither side of the restaurant ever filled up.

Servings were small so not made for sharing with a large group (ex two small empanadas). Brussels sprouts were good but it was a little odd that it only seemed like leaves so not very hearty.

She lives in west philly and came all the way to the northeast to meet us for dinner. I have tried fogo, Chima and Nabrasa and I would highly recommend this place. Prices are very reasonable. I believe the all you can eat is $31.99 on the weekend per person. Or as others have said you can pay by pound which none of the other Brazilian steakhouses offer. Restaurant does seem to be newly remodeled and has a nice contemporary look but still stuffy or pretentious. Servers are very friendly but English is definitely not their forte. They tried though and it worked out. \n\nWe opted for the per pound because I didn't want to roll myself out so they do not come to the tables with the meats when you choose that option. You instead are all self service including the salad bar and you go to the meat carving station and tell them which cuts you want. Salad bar was much smaller than other restaurants but had a nice variety of options and they tasted good! Meats were well seasoned, may be a little salty for some palates so if you want less salt def do ask for an inside piece and not the first cut. We tried a little of everything, the top sirloin was my favorite cut. \n\nAnd thank you fellow yelpers for the tip on bringing your own rum. I did and the restaurant did make a pitcher of capirinha with it  only thing it was a little too sweet would ask for less sweet next time. I only brought the rum, they supplied everything else to make the drink. \n\n4 people who left full, With coffee, tea and sodas (not included with your meal) and one dessert (flan, delicious!) was about $80. Not bad at all! Will definitely be back. \n\nHelpful tip for the restaurant, please label the sides at the salad bar.

The meats being cooked over REAL wood fire (and the quality of ingredients being essentially the same as the fancy places made this a great bargain at the original price (around $15.) \n\nSubsequently, I had been splitting my rodizio visits among this place and its newer competitors. The place remodeled a while back, and looks much more upscale (though still not \"fancy.\")\n\nDecor aside, the majority of us go to these places for a rodizio meat orgy. Last night (2/21/19) a half dozen of us visited and walked away less than thrilled.  The salad bar was well-stocked, with good stuff .. fresh veggies, salads and the usual Brazilian specialties.  However, just because the name is \"Picanha\" doesn't mean that's all we expect to eat.  We were proffered a \"garlic steak\" of undetermined cut first .. all well-done.  Subsequently, with the exception of one pass with well done alcatra (top sirloin) and a number of linguica (sausage) sausage and dry chicken thighs, 90% of the meat was Picanha.  Granted, some were tender and delicious, others just so-so, there was no skirt steak, no beef or pork rib, no lamb,no fraldinha or maminha... you get the idea.  The \"baby\" picanha were just small (and thus well-done) pieces of ...you guessed it .. picanha.\n\nService was friendly, and for the most part, meats kept coming.. for awhile... after an hour, we sort of experienced a long lull until we were presented with ... more picanha.\n\nWith the prices topping $30, the bargain doesn't seem so much a bargain compared to some of the \"mid range\" rodizios popping up in the suburbs.  Sad to see, because the potential is still there.  Maybe weekends they pull out more variety?  \n\nAnyway, if you are an old fan and haven't returned in awhile, lower your expectations.  If you are fine with a feast of rump meat with a nice fat cap, you can get your money's worth.

I, of course, thought the salad bar was a waste of my time the first time I dined here and only ate a tiny bit - but now I know you have to eat salad bar to not feel meat-sick the next day.  The meat itself is tremendous.  And they just keep bringing it.  I don't like to create food waste, so I had to keep turning my \"stop/go\" card over and over so I didn't get crazy amounts of meat on one plate.   But then when you know what tastes the best you can make sure they direct that guy over to you more often.  \n\nPersonally, I don't need chicken when I come to Chima.  I want red meat and maybe a tiny but of seafood.  I also love the grilled cinnamon pineapple.  They have different sauces on the salad bar but I didn't think any of the cuts of meat needed it.  \n\nLastly, this year they sent my boyfriend home with delish birthday cake.

I said to her that I requested a table where my wife's back was facing the rest of the people so she could comfortably raise her niqab and eat. She said, I didn't hear that, now mind you she was standing directly behind the hostess. She told me she had limited seating and couldn't accommodate us. I said is this how you treat people with religious needs. \nShe told me she treats everyone equally. I said how can you say you treat everyone equally when you can't accommodate the needs of your religious  patrons. At this point we left and as I was leaving I turned and said to the manager that due to your lack of equality and sensitivity to the needs of others, that  we won't be back.  \n\nI just want to note , I feel that our  needs aren't perceived as  a priority  we could have  been accommodated. There was definitely enough room and places that  the manager  could have put us.  She just didn't want to do it, as a personal comfort to herself and her staff. The manager came out with the word \"equally\", which to me means my religious needs are as important as anyone else's needs, which they obviously weren't. I don't even know how she could have the  word \"equally\" come out of her mouth. I was quite upset with the way this was handled, where as even if after all that, and she had changed her mind and was suddenly able to accommodate us I wouldn't have been able to stay there due to the awkward setting that the manager placed us in. To me and my wife, we just perceive this as, it was meant to be.  That we didn't spend our money to support this establishment. But we felt the need to have our voice heard. \nThis place is not ready to accept our Muslim population.  \nBut seriously here, Is this how the Longhorn franchise plans on treating its Muslim population?", "date": "2021-04-03 17:47:13", "user": {"name": "Twisted", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2019-05-18 12:50:02", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.63, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "XoF-01sS1iOOGN9LgH22rA", "user_id": "ML-gBz6eBm-_Fyj64R3bUw", "business_id": "RNgb844JJbo6vO1iUod8vA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Covid makes dining out difficult.

He offered to provide a new order to which I declined because again I live a 15-minute drive away and expressed to him that I would prefer a refund to which he replied  \"No we don't do that  we would just replace it .\" Neither the boneless wings nor the buffalo wings I ordered had blue cheese dip as described online when ordering. This was very disappointing. I should have just waited in the long Chick-fil-A line, at least the food would have been fresh, freshly prepared, and worth the money spent.

I have had many poor experiences as a customer, but have never before taken to Yelp about them...  it takes quite a bit to get me to publicly blast anyone.  But here we are.\n\nMy family and I have ordered from Steak & Shake countless times, and it's typically been a good experience.  That said, the experience we had this evening was so bad it's resulting in my first ever review on Yelp...\n\nWe ordered through grub hub at 4:24pm, and were given an ETA of 5:20-5:30.  At 5:48, my wife called to check on our order.  On the first call she was immediately put on hold and the call disconnected.  On the second call, she asked for an update on delivery time, and they told her they could not give one, as the food was still cooking, and they were waiting for a delivery driver to come back.  We're talking about a couple of cheesesteaks and burgers here, not roasting a turkey, btw.  My wife then asked if we could pick it up instead, but instead of a simple \"yes\" or \"no\", they just kept telling her (aggressively) that the food was still cooking, and they couldn't do anything else for her.  Then they hung up on my wife with no resolution.  Then I called and asked to speak to a manager.  I was put on hold and a woman picked up the phone, but didn't identify themselves.  If she was a manager, she is a poor one.  I explained the situation, and the previous two phone calls, and still all she would tell me was that the food was still cooking.  I reminded her that we ordered over 90 minutes prior, and she told me that Grub Hub was down on their end, so they didn't get the order until 4:50.  I explained that that's still over an hour to cook a burger and a couple cheesesteaks.  She asked me what I wanted her to do about it, and I said we'd still like to pick it up if possible, but I'd like her to take something off the bill due to the ridiculous wait.  She STILL wouldn't say whether we could pick up or not (somehow the food still cooking had something to do with this) and that any dispute over the bill would have to go through grub hub.  \nWhile the bill may indeed have been a grub hub issue, the woman was consistently rude, interrupting me, and repeating herself over and over that the food was still cooking.  She made no effort whatsoever to make the situation right, and as someone with 20+ years experience managing kitchens and restaurants, I told her all I was looking for was a straight answer on pickup, and for something resembling customer service from her end.  At this point I told her that without a resolution, I would relay my experience on Yelp, in hopes that we could avoid this and actually get our food.  Instead of trying to find a resolution, she basically told me to piss off for a yelp review that hadn't been written yet (and didn't have to be).\nShockingly, at this point I was \"disconnected\", and a few minutes later we received a call from grub hub that our order was cancelled, and that we would receive a full refund.  That's nice and all, but we're still hungry, and ordered food over 2 hrs ago.  We've ordered a ton from these guys, and usually with a hefty $$ amount on our tickets.

Our experience at your center city Philadelphia location does not live up to your marketing nor the expectations we had.  Let me start with the drinks we had while waiting for our table.  In the words of my wife, they were watered down and considering that we spent $32.00 for 3 drinks before we were even seated it was not a good start to the evening.  Once we were seated, we ordered from the Seasonal menu for the day.  My wife ordered the mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat.  The mushrooms were raw and the \"supposed\" crabmeat was only lukewarm, needless to say we were disappointed again.  Next was the soup for the day, the \"gumbo\", unlike any gumbo I have ever experienced.  It was more like your basic beef stew but with very few vegetables and not really appetizing at all.  So, here comes the Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops, they were nice sized and cooked as expected but the overall dish was lacking.   The scallops sat on a bed of diced vegetable that appeared to have been saut\u00e9ed in a teriyaki sauce, nothing special about this dish.  My wife only ate the scallops, strike number 3 with her.  My dish was the \"Seasonal\" Rib-Eye.  The temperature of the steak was what I had request but it did not appear that it had been near a broiler of grill, again it was just lukewarm.  It looked like the steak was just cut from roast that had been precooked.  According to the menu, the side are supposed to have been personal sized but what we got was one each of the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, again not up to par to the high level you claim.  So between the drinks and the meal, not counting the tip because the waitress was fine, we spent close to $190.00.  I won't even mention the deserts that came with the meal.

I will say this, the valet was great, the host staff were pleasant and our server was very friendly. However, my husband and I had been waiting to go there for our first time, on our anniversary. I made reservations in advance and even put in our reservation that we were coming to celebrate our anniversary. We are brought to our table and they initially had us a booth right in front at the bar..people's butts would have been in our faces all night long. We couldn't believe they would seat anyone there, let alone someone who made reservations and had indicated it was a special evening. We asked them to change our table and they did, so that did work out ok..it was just very off putting that they would even seat us there in the first place.\nWe ordered our food and my husband did like his meal. I however spent $45 on a filet that was inedible. I know in the steak world, they think your steak should be medium rare or medium at the most, but I like my steak well done..to each their own, right? And if you're a good chef, a chef at one of the areas top steak houses no less, you should be able to cook a steak any way the customer wants. I can do it great at home. Well apparently not at Ruth's Chris. They sent me a charred, burned, over cooked piece of meat. Well done does not mean burnt! I have never seen a filet be so tough in my life and I have ordered filet well done at other restaurants and still have it cut like butter. I ate 4 bites then had to spit the last one out because I couldn't even break it down it was so charred. Our server did come to ask how everything was, but it was right after our food was brought out and I hadn't even cut into my steak yet..didn't see him again until after the plates were cleared but the runner.\nWe had been looking forward to that night for months, and now I can honestly say I would never go to Ruth's Chris again.

Let me start off by saying I've been a customer of this establishment for over a decade, starting in 2002.  Just out of college, I remember my first experiences at this restaurant were simply remarkable.  Paying for a $50 steak was heavy on the budget, but I felt it was well worth it, the steak came out sizzling, the sides were plentiful, the ambience was alluring.  I would try other steak restaurants such as Morton's, Capital Grille, Union Trust, they were all good steaks, but I always came back to Ruth's Chris because they always made their steak, in my opinion, JUST right.  \n\nEach year my wife treats me for my birthday at a steak restaurant because I love a great steak dinner.  I rotate between Ruth's Chris and another steak restaurant of my choosing on off years.  This year my wife asks me where I would like to go for dinner, I don't want to leave anything to chance, so I tell her to make reservations to Ruth's Chris.  Sadly, this will probably be the last reservation I ever make to this restaurant.  I order a steak, medium rare, and I'm positive that it's overcooked.  They send out another one, and same story, overcooked.  I cut through the center, showed it to the guy next to me, we're in complete agreement that it's a medium well to well done steak.  I feel horrible, and feel like a complete dick about this.  The third steak is completely undercooked, rightfully so, so I just ask for the check cause i didn't want to deal with another interaction with the management.

She really is a pro at taking care of the bar and the house ordered drinks. Can't wait to see her again.\n\nLast night Ian was running the bar and it was not good. He was not attentive, the drinks were practically juice and being sent back from the other patrons who were at the bar. We even saw folks walk out and they had arrived right before we were going to leave. People were asking where their drinks were because they had ordered them like 20 minutes ago and the restaurant wasn't crowded either. When he made our drinks he never came back to how it was and if we wanted to order food. I had to flag him down and asks to put a food order in. I asked him for the pretzels that were on the menu and he had no idea what I was talking about when I asked for extra cheese. Our appetizers finally come out. They're good but not once did he check on us. I had to flag him down once again to order my favorite dessert there - Blue Ribbon Brownie. Once we were done I had to flag him down for the check  which he took 20 minutes to print out. At this point I was so pissed I walked around the restaurant to find the manager and asked him to run my card.

There wasn't a hostess at the hostess stand and after waiting a few minutes, we decided to seat ourselves. Thankfully, our server came a few minutes later with menus.\n\nWe ordered a few drinks and I enjoyed the manhattan, although it took a long time for it to come out. I'm not sure if our server forgot about our drinks or if the bartender was just that slow... but either way after waiting 10 minutes, I heard our server mention our drinks to the bartender and he finally made them. Thankfully, they were good!\n\nI ordered the spinach salad and split the garden vegetable flatbread with my friend. Surprisingly, the salad was huge! I loved the large portion and really enjoyed that it came with pomegranate seeds. The garden flatbread was packed with veggies and perfect for sharing. Both were delicious and seemed to be made with fresh ingredients. \n\nOverall, the service was just okay. I didn't enjoy the long wait for drinks and it was hard to find our server at times, although the restaurant itself isn't large and wasn't busy on a Friday night.

First, we arrived at the restaurant only to find it is really a bar with a couple of dining seats.  There was a hostess stand but nobody was at it.  The bartender stared at us but did not say anything.  We waited at least 3 minutes before the hostess/waitress came and asked if she could help us.  We explained that we wanted to have a drink before we sat for our reservation.\n\nWe had a drink at one of the long tables before we took our seats.  (Note: Props to the restaurant for having lots of power outlets throughout the place so guest can charge their electronics.) They were good, but for such a small place it took way too long for us to be served.  In addition, the table was not flat, so we had to search for a place to put our rather full glasses.\n\nOnce we were seated we explained to the server that we had a Groupon.  She said we could pick any 2 appetizers, any 2 entrees, and any 2 desserts.  We selected the shrimp cocktail, the flatbread pizza, the brick chicken, the steak frittes, and 2 molten cakes.  We also ordered a bottle of wine.   The shrimp (4 of them) were cooked nicely, but the cocktail sauce it came with was bland and runny and did not stick to the shrimp.  The sauce was served in a glass that was way too large for the portion of shrimp served.  The flatbread was soggy and tasteless.  The chicken was good, but it was served with mostly tasteless asparagus and underdone fingerling potatoes.  The steak was cooked well but under-seasoned (salt, pepper, and A-1 had to be added), and the frittes tasted stale.  The best part of the dinner was the desserts: the molten cakes came with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, and they were very good.\n\nThe waitress was very personable, but she was very slow.  It was also clear she did not know anything about serving wine.  The bartender must have opened it for her, because it came tableside with the cork stuffed in the neck.  She did not offer a taste, and instead poured each of us a glass.  It was a red wine, and rather than leave the cork out so that the wine could breath she stuffed it back into the bottle.\n\nWhen the waitress brought the checks (for some reason the bottle of wine was separate from the rest of the check) she explained that she subtracted the promotional value of the Groupon from the check and charged us the difference.  We explained that the Groupon said we were covered for the 3 courses. We asked to speak to her manager.  The waitress disappeared for at least 5 minutes.  When she returned she said we would be charged for our drinks, the bottle of wine, and the tax on our dinner.  We asked if she would put all of the charges on one bill, and she said yes.\n\nWill we return? Probably not.

Alas, the transition is a big fail. 2 1/2 years ago right after the transition we went to check it out. So bad and tragically changed we vowed to never again. Floppy crust, sharp unrefined sauce and decidedly cheaper cheese. This much later my loving wife encouraged a second chance. Yesterday we went again. Upfront, the positive, the tomato pie was somewhat recovered, a crispy thin crust though lacking the aromatic depth of better olive oil seemingly gone with the previous owners, sauce still sharp and correctly oregano forward but lacking the sweetness of modest garlic and basil, cheese still the cheap kind and missing that quality tang. Crispy and well textured but perhaps a little on the burnt side. Longer cooking for crispness in accommodation for a recipe changed? All the same, were this my first visit and were this still in my neighborhood I might have gone back. The biggest difference was the waitress, decidedly the worst I've had in years. Inattentive and inefficient, she would repeatedly walk by without checking or bussing dishes.

We were there quite long catching up over LITE draft beers and a bunch of appetizers. We decided to switch over to bar when tables outside were clearing out. The bartender was completely rude we felt as if we were inconveniencing here from our existence which is bizarre because that is your job- hospitality . After two beers each she approached us and asked if we were \"okay\" we replied yes? She went on to tell us we were there a long time and had a lot to drink. I asked if we appear visibly intoxicated?! \"Well no \" I said are we being cut off? She then got visibly angry with us and said \" hun I'm still serving you your beer \" it was a very weird encounter. I've never had one like it in my lifetime. It did not feel genuine or like it came from a good place because I understand bars are responsible to a certain extent but if we're just chatting and having beers and are not appearing drunk, what's the problem? I honestly feel as if it were 3 men doing the same thing it wouldn't even be an issue or a conversation. Why because were women and drinking more than what you think we should have? \n\nMeanwhile she is pouring shots for workers who must of finished there shifts down the other end of the bar still wearing their Tony's shirts. Inside there was an entire table of staff being loud and drinking. (Not a good look for an establishment) staff drinking and representing your business. \n\nThe manager was I guess setting up brunch for the next day. He looked like he may of been on something.

It's about 30% more in cost than most other pizzerias but we figured if the pizza is amazing, it'll be worth it (not to mention, the noted coupon code). I picked up a pepperoni tomato pie with cheese (pie's $12, toppings cost $2 and cheese costs $2). Food was promptly delivered hot, looked really good. Dough is very thin and brittle toward the outer edges (almost cracker like), cheese is thick, heavy handed on the sauce which is on top of the cheese, and pepperoni is flavorful with a little heat. Pie was very good, better than your average fair. Very reminiscent of Santucci's but as a round pie. I think Santucci's, which is pricey as well, is a little bit cheaper. Santucci's delivers a product that I could bring myself to pay the extra cost for once in a while but I think Tony's tests the limit of even that expense.

Did enjoy the frites that came with them. Alas, the gnocchi were just...okay, which breaks my heart.  They weren't as delicate and profound as I had hoped. Sigh. Where in this city can I feed my crippling gnocchi addiction?!\n\nI had their version of paella, which was a good serving and had plenty of fresh seafood, but again was a little too salty.

Again, I'd have to say the first courses are great, but the main courses were salty and otherwise underwhelming.  We started with the empanadas (corn and cheese - yum), arepas (people were happy), a beet salad with frisee (perfectly tart dressing, yummy beets and goat cheese), and the clam soup (EAT THIS), which was light and had a really good combo of flavors.  I wish I'd ordered the soup for main course. \n\nTwo of us ordered the malbec braised short rib pappardelle, and were happy but not raving.  I gorged on the arroz a la gallega - chocked with lots of fresh shellfish and fish, but way salty, as before.  Colin was happy with the creamy polenta with romesco sauce (which we learned was a Catalan sauce of pine nuts, garlic and olive oil. Sold!). \n\nI stand by the first review that it is a 2.5 for food.  The ingredients are fresh and the atmosphere is great, but the main dishes just aren't cutting it.\n\nFIRST VISIT\nGot a reservation for five at 8pm calling earlier in the day.  Not too hard to get for a Saturday night, but the place was definitely full.  A crisp fall evening, perfect for a group dinner in a boisterous dining room (if you're into that kind of thing; it sure did get loud!).  The atmosphere was really cozy, wait staff was friendly without being overbearing.  Since it was a snug fit, we got to chatting with our neighbors who recommended against the Fish of the Day (Scottish Salmon), and highly recommended tuna taquitos.\n\nFor five, we share tuna taquitos, gnocchi, cornmeal crusted calamari, and empanadas.  Tuna taquitos: four mini taquitos of rare tuna in crispy, not-greasy shells topped with a mango lime slaw.  Awesome - the highlight of the dinner for me.  Gnocchi: we agreed it was overcooked and underwhelming, but who said it was an Argentinean specialty?  The chimichurri served with the empanadas was fresh and fragrant.  Yums.\n\nSomehow we ended up getting the same 2 dishes for main plates - 2 of us got the \"lamb three ways\" (roasted leg, grilled rib, and sausage) and 3 of us got the spare rib braised in malbec.  Jeff didn't care for the braised rib at all, and I didn't hear raves from the the other 2, either.  I enjoyed my grilled rib and the lentils cassoulet-style; the serving of the leg was huge, perfectly done and tender, but it could have used more trimming -  a bit fatty; the lamb sausage didn't have any love to give - it was overdone and the seasonings were nuked out except for a hint of sage. Oh well.\n\nIt came out to under $45 a piece.  I'd give 2.5 stars if I could because the food wasn't great, and that includes narrowly avoiding ordering bad salmon.

Great BYOB for Argentine cuisine-- bring a few bottles of a good Malbec with you. Unassuming on the outside and charming inside with lots of kitschy items on the walls and all the waitstaff in dressed in plaid shirts. Friendly and attentive service, and lively atmosphere.  \n\nLoved the free crunchy breadsticks with sweet bell pepper aioli. The aioli was very tasty; we kept it through the entree courses to use as a dip for our thick-cut fries. I'd highly recommend starting with the calamari (the breading wasn't too heavy, and it was drizzled with a  nice barbecue sauce) and the queso fundido (the chorizo sausage inside made it really great).  \n\nAll the protein entrees come with two side dishes included (one starch and one vegetable dish). I had the fish of the day, mako (shark), with sweet potato and creamed spinach. Every component of the dish was superb and perfectly cooked. I'd also recommend the shortribs papardelle- the meat melts in your mouth. \n\nI thought the bone-in ribeye was solid, but I wasn't wowed. And even though I enjoyed the seafood rice dish (essentially a paella), it was rather soupy and I would have preferred a higher rice to soup ratio. \n\nSave room for dessert. We had dulce de leche panqueques (crepes), which were great, and I noticed other tables with small cakes that looked pretty delicious as well.\n\nOverall, a terrific dinner- I'd definitely come back again.", "date": "2010-10-31 22:16:47", "user": {"name": "Connie", "review_count": 97, "yelping_since": "2010-10-29 11:43:47", "elite": "2011,2012", "average_stars": 3.78, "fans": 5}}], "review_count_actual": 25}

Yamato is the latest restaurant I saw on DoorDash that offered it and gave them a try. I ordered chicken katsu, pork fried gyoza, vegetable tempura, and tempura ice cream. The katsu was delicious, you get two butterflied panko-bread crumb entrusted fried breasts that is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Along with the katsu BBQ dipping sauce and the lemon wedge I squeezed upon it, it's the best fried chicken you can get. The gyoza is a crispy and flavorful dumpling that works well as an appetizer. For the vegetable tempura, the only ones I recognized were the sweet potato and broccoli but the other two I'm unsure about (perhaps some kind of squash and Japanese eggplant). The sweet potato was good, the other offerings were disappointing offering little in the way of flavor or texture. Potatoes or onions would've been good substitutes. Tempura vanilla ice cream was delicious, the batter was crispy and spongey, giving it a good mouth feel with the hot crunch of the tempura and cold, frozen vanilla cream. I also got to try the tempura cheesecake which was also delicious. Quality graham cracker crust New York-style cheesecake wrapped in a crispy, spongey fried batter. The prices are a bit steep and the menu is extensive (I understand the physical restaurant offers even more items than on DoorDash). I highly recommend giving them a try especially if you like sushi because they seem to offer a massive variety (though I didn't see my favorite, inari/fried tofu, on DoorDash).", "date": "2021-09-15 00:59:01", "user": {"name": "Jerry", "review_count": 132, "yelping_since": "2010-08-18 21:19:58", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.46, "fans": 11}}, {"review_id": "8cg-BX1DXFO9A8BlbE9MEA", "user_id": "ePTX9sxb7BFssmjPihZClA", "business_id": "D48I-imYNjFo9bmsiZc-YQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This place is amazing. \nextremely polite staff \nthe food is the best around \nlook no further !!", "date": "2021-09-09 23:01:45", "user": {"name": "Mikey", "review_count": 2, "yelping_since": "2020-12-10 12:48:58", "elite": "", "average_stars": 5.0, "fans": 0}}, {"review_id": "X1-bB_E9eeS5AW7qgZ1MmQ", "user_id": "7hsDhmuV0YGG6jtwDhSr6g", "business_id": "D48I-imYNjFo9bmsiZc-YQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "We went last night for Hibachi since our usual place still isn't doing Hibachi since Covid and we were seated right away.

After supporting this local business for many years, I am astonished at the response to my FIRST TIME EVER call with a problem.

I did so and was disappointed to see that it was a different chicken sandwich, when I got it home. No matter, she made the best of it. Couple days ago, she again asked. I ordered it along with another sandwich. My daughter didn't wake up until after 10pm so it wasn't opened right away. About 10:20 she happily opened it and .. no chicken, but beef! She can't eat beef! I was more than disappointed as any little thing I can do to brighten her day is what I aspire to do. This time I decided I'm going to call and let them know because that's two times and the sandwiches keep going up in price so it's a bit of a luxury to order dinner from there. I did make a call but they were closed. So the next morning I called again and Pat who I spoke to was lovely but the sad part was that Barry, the owner, told her to tell me there was nothing he could do for me as the day was over. Said I should have called! We called immediately once discovered. They were closed! He said the tickets were all gone. Told them I had the ticket AND my receipt! And the sandwich!!!! NO GO! So... I will no longer go there nor do I recommend this establishment anymore. To lose a long-term customer ever one sandwich is the worst practice I have ever witnessed. Very very disappointing.

I usually dislike going to steakhouses, because they are unusually high-priced and I can sear a mean steak myself at home. The regular menu at Union Trust is quite expensive; the steaks goes up to $125 a pop, caviars to $140 an ounce. For lunch, however, it's a little different.\n\nThere is some privilege from being a blogger, especially when you enter a rather new restaurant with a phone cam and start snapping away, you'll get some curiosity and attention from the staff. I'm not saying you'll get free food or drinks, but at least the people seemed friendlier. Sure, the maitre'd banged my knees against the marble after helping pushing my barstool in for me, but he tried. The lunch menu consists on some appetizers, salad, sandwiches and entrees that average around $15. I wanted to keep it cheap, so I didn't order the $13 lobster chowder for an appetizer and went for the much recommended steak frites. Not soon after, I received a bread basket with 4 different kinds of warmed breads: A sweet pumpernickel raisin roll, a whole wheat dinner roll, a sesame sunflower seed roll and a twin Philly pretzel stick that you can split apart which also comes with its own little bottle of whole grain Dijon mustard.\n\nI have had my share of bad steak frites, but one should expect a nice one from a steakhouse no matter the price and this one didn't disappoint. The size was decent enough, it was perfectly seared with salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne pepper and maybe oven-baked for doneness. The fries came in a playful string size, crunchy and quite bouche amus\u00e9e. The sauce on the side tasted like an Argentinian chimichurri. The dish was quite simple and flavorful. It came with a side of creamed spinach that was smooth and buttery without being overwhelmingly rich or oily. It was a good meal that left me wanting more.\n\nIt's hard for business these days and not a lot of people can afford the items on the dinner menu for sure, but it's nice to see new restaurants popping up. Just around the same block, there's Iron Chef's Morimoto, another Philadelphia restaurateur Stephen Starr's Jones, an Italian restaurant LaScala and a new Latin/Asian fusion restaurant called Chifa which will probably be my next target. The competition is fierce on this little out of the way block. While the promotion of the place is low-key, maybe people will give the lunch a try or warm up to the Gay professional mingles hosted there once a week. The former marbled bank got renovated into a majestic train station lobby-like space with red plush couches and white chairs. It looks quite amazing.

I was never quite able to fit it in between the excursions to Chifa and the occasional Morimoto indulgence (all three restaurants are located on the same side of the same block, along with a Southeast Asian place that I am yet to check out). Last week, however, I noticed that the twice-yearly Bane of Line Cooks *ahem* Restaurant Week was coming up and that Union Trust was participating once again, so I decided to finally put my curiosity to sleep.\n\nThe pre-meal service was sub-par. I actually arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes after my reservation time, only to learn that the Trust was running about an hour late. I had worked almost ten hours and wasn't exactly in the mood to eat my meal sandwiched between bro-dudes and senior management office rockers, so no, I did not take the matire d up on her suggestion to get a bar seat when I had already reserved a normal one. Ego inflation isn't my bag, but I'm kind of insulted that she'd even suggest that, actually. \n\nAfter about twenty minutes of making up stories in my head about how douchey the bar patrons that I totally didn't sit next to probably were, I finally got a seat in the middle of the restaurant. Quite frankly, Union Trust has the most beautiful space I have seen in Philadelphia, if not anywhere. It's seriously worth coming to once for that alone. The overall shape is almost like a cross between an old cathedral and a posh train station, with a couple stories' worth of open air, a second floor balcony bar, huge blacklit windows, and a bathroom area that looks like it's straight out of a vintage James Bond flick. It managed to bypass every single one of my bullshit detectors and \"I hate everything!\" markers. I don't think about the Illuminati much, but when I do, I imagine them eating somewhere like this. Seriously stunning.\n\nWith that said, if Yelp was an architecture website, this place would get six stars. As a restaurant, however, I have to cut that number down by half, because I spent about half as much time thinking about my food as I did thinking about where I was eating it. I ordered (1) the bacon-ranch-bleu salad, (2) the filet mignon, (3) the cheesecake, and (4) the crab cake, in 4-1-2-3 order. The crab cake was excellent - a single lump that was balanced perfectly between protein, aioli, and vegetable (tomato and cucumber). At $15, I probably wouldn't spring for it right away again, but then again rent for that space does not come cheap. The salad was basically bleu cheese and bacon chilling on a boat of salad in a sea of buttermilk dressing. The bacon was dense, salty, and flavorful, but the rest was forgettable, with the boat being too dry and the sea too deep. The filet was functional at best - a bit overcooked (\"medium rare\" != tough on the outside + barely any pink) and a bit overspiced. The accompanying sides were similarly ho-hum. The raspberry cheesecake was great, but great cheesecakes are as common as PPA tickets. Nothing was done poorly in this meal, but at the same time, nothing except the usurious crab cake was truly compelling.\n\nOverall, Union Trust is a bit like the band who got big and upped their production values while forgetting to keep writing great songs, except all memories of whatever that band used to be were erased from humanity's collective memory. Maybe the chefs will recover the files one of these days - I can't do it for them.", "date": "2012-10-05 17:39:10", "user": {"name": "Nnamdi", "review_count": 27, "yelping_since": "2008-06-23 01:18:49", "elite": "", "average_stars": 3.41, "fans": 2}}, {"review_id": "yil38F8fh9CFZBs-ftqbOA", "user_id": "aM3T4jeHY_fswn6xQ41rtw", "business_id": "2pMdDOWl14rU4jdAH4oZXw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "A little disappointed.\n\nWent here with my wife on a living social deal (2 for $99) so we had the fixed menu.

(We overheard the greeter tell other guests who did not have reservations that it would be an hour wait for a table for two!) We had a Livingsocial voucher- a 4-course prix-fixed dinner for 2. The inside of the restaurant was beautiful. There were elegant stained windows and an ornamented ceiling. We were seated on the second floor, in a very private narrow strip beside the balcony, overlooking the whole restaurant. It was the best seat in the house. \n\nI ordered the lobster bisque, calamari, entree of filet mignon, side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes, and Philadelphia cheesecake for dessert. He ordered a Field Green salad, Kobe Carpaccio, dry aged bone KC steak, side of truffle fries, and the cheesecake for dessert as well. The complimentary bread arrived first, and although we enjoyed the bread, we agreed that it was a really random assortment of bread- 2 cheesy garlic biscuits (a la Red Lobster) , 4 slices of pumpkin bread, and 2 soft pretzel sticks. We ordered their Happy Appy cocktail (according to the menu, made with gin, Aperol, fresh grapefruit, and lime) and I decided that Happy Appy was the best cocktail I had ever had. The taste of alcohol was barely noticeable and the intensity of the sweet tangy grapefruit was a delicious surprise. We then proceeded to wait over half an hour before our food arrived...\n\nLong story short, it was the last day to redeem the Livingsocial voucher, so the kitchen was really backed up with all the Livingsocial meals (the Livingsocial 4- course meal offered a different selection than the regular menu) and the order of our courses was completely messed up after a very long delay. Our server was extremely apologetic and we received 2 complimentary cocktails. We chose the Lemon Sparkling Spritzer, which was a more refined version of Mike's Hard Lemonade. Quite refreshing, but not as impressive as the Happy Appy.\n\nThe lobster bisque was alright, in my opinion, although my boyfriend enjoyed it. I felt that it was too heavy and the lobster didn't taste as fresh as it could have. The field green salad had salt and olive dress drizzled on top, and it was way too salty. The truffle fries were nothing spectacular- delicious, but nothing out of the ordinary. The mashed potatoes, however, were delicious. The calamari was good but were were getting too full by the time it came around and the carpaccio was...interesting. Very tender and had a fish-like aftertaste. Not a bad fish-like aftertaste, but it was just a very interesting dish. Our entrees were cooked to near perfection and I chose the Union Trust steak sauce, which had a nice plum taste to it, for my filet mignon. By the time dessert arrived, we were both too full to fully appreciate it. Our server gladly boxed up our leftover cheesecakes and humorously suggested we have it for breakfast the next day.\n\nAt the end of our meal, our server informed us that we need not pay for our meal or drinks because management  was really embarrassed about the whole mix up situation. Our vouchers would be valid for another meal and he implored us to return a second time for \"proper service\". \n\nWe were pleased with the way they handled the situation and left a proper tip. Union Trust gets a 5 because of the way they handled their little mix up and the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was delicious but we were most impressed by the whole experience.", "date": "2012-09-17 02:07:43", "user": {"name": "Rosa", "review_count": 373, "yelping_since": "2012-08-27 01:18:42", "elite": "2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 4.19, "fans": 13}}, {"review_id": "3tOoVUvYGcig28GUTDmbng", "user_id": "FBWkscr1BVNANlgODRLAyg", "business_id": "2pMdDOWl14rU4jdAH4oZXw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I took my boyfriend to Union Trust for his birthday dinner as he is a HUGE fan of steaks, done Pittsburgh Black and Blue.

You cannot beat that! Naturally, our drinks and tips weren't covered, but we were more than happy to generously provide the balance as our experience was spectacular!\n\nWe were seated in the middle of the restaurant, at a table for two. Now, I am about 5 feet tall and my boyfriend ain't much taller, so we felt that that table was way to large for us, we could barely touch eachothers fingertips! So we asked to be seated somewhere else. They kindly obliged and sat us in one of the velvet covered booths near the bar - MUCH better! So intimate!\n\nOur server, Alex, was so kind and attentive. And the other waitstaff who came to our table were very nice, too.\n\nAs for the food - AMAZING! We both started with lobster bisque - so rich and creamy, with a good bit of lobster chunks swimming around. Next we shared our calamari and tuna tartare. With the calamari came a spicy, jalapeno/chili sauce that really added a nice element to the every so slightly crusted and fried squid. I hate when calamari is over battered then fried, why people?! The tuna was topped with an avocado mousse and served with potato crisps. In the tuna were pieces of red onion, parsley and maybe something else but I couldnt put my finger on it. For the mains, I ordered the 12 oz KC strip with truffle butter - perfection. Truffle + beef = happy girl. My man ordered the filet with espresso crust, also delicious and different. By dessert we were stuffed, but we managed a few bites.

How's that for irony?  But anyway, where do I start?  The outside of Union Trust is modest and non-suspecting, but the inside is pure swankiness with a side of swankiness.  There were a lot more tables in there than I thought there would be, but everything was still spaced out.  The ceiling was so high up I forgot whether I was in a church or a restaurant.  Was I still in Philadelphia or did I portal myself to NYC by accident?\n\nThe staff led us to a booth and then gave us their drinks menu.  They have an impressive wine list, but I felt bad cheating on Philly Beer Week, so I went with an Allagash.  I then grilled the waiter (pun intended) about the use of butter on any of their steaks or dishes and he said that they don't use it.  I was really impressed by this because butter is often used by steakhouses to add flavor and maintain moistness.  So, Union Trust can basically make you a steak that has both of those qualities without adding dairy into the mix.  Feeling confident with the waiter and knowing that I wouldn't spiral into a dairy-induced allergic reaction, I ordered a medium-well filet with the porcini balsamic reduction.  We also ordered the baked potato and a side of the roasted mushrooms to share.\n\nOur food did take a while to come out (and the waiter was not the fastest with the drink service), but when dinner finally arrived it was worth the wait.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the reduction that went with it was stellar.  I tried a bite of their rib-eye, as well, and it was excellent.  The baked potato that came out was the biggest spud I've ever seen in my entire life.  I'm convinced it could have fed a family of four.  The mushrooms were lightly seasoned and they went well with the meal.  All in all, it was really a wonderful dinner.

It was difficult.  \n\nThis Alice came over a few times, trying to be nice.   She told us we can wait in the high top area, but cannot be seated.  20 minutes later, she said she can \"partially\" seat us in the basement.  I said no.  The kids are not vaccinated and we made a reservation and the first floor had ample empty tables.  But No, cannot be seated.  Later hubby and parents returned and were told we only can get seated downstairs, because I was not nice to her. \n\n\nGrow up, please.  You sent a 60 year old birthday lady home to change because of your snobby dress code.  The definition of \"business casual\" is quite arbitrary.

My wife went to the table while I waited for the drinks at the bar. When I arrived at the table with our drinks the bread was already placed on the table and was already cold. Our server was wonderful, very pleasant, professional,  and attentive. We started with oysters and calamari, both were excellent. The oysters tasted fresh and the accompanying sauces were delicious. We ordered steaks and sides. My strip med rare and my wifes filet medium. My strip was med well and the filet was rare. My wife decided she would keep hers and let it rest a few minutes. Our server offered to have a new one cooked for me but knowing my wife's food, and the sides, would be cold by the time a new steak arrived I declined. Unfortunately it was not as good at that temperature but it was good still. My suggestion would be to offer to have the drinks brought to our table so we could have been seated together. If a steak temp is incorrect have new sides brought with the newly cooked steaks. The manager did approach us, we assumed because the server mentioned the steak temp to him (the server confirmed our assumption), but he never mentioned this fact but I was almost halfway through my steak and wasn't about to mention it.

When we went back to the host stand we saw someone walking out with a hoodie and asked Alice \"how were they allowed in with a hoodie and we just had to leave and buy new clothes?\" Her response was \"I assure you they were not wearing a hoodie, we apply the dress code to everyone\". Not only was that a dismissive comment but it was also WRONG because when we sat down we saw at least 5 more hoodies (im including photos of some). We pointed it out to another person working there who apologized to us and apologized for their inconsistency. Alice never apologized or said anything. Rude. \n\nIt is not our issue that hoodies are not allowed in the restaurant. My issue is that my partner was asked to change when others weren't and I can guarantee it was because of how he looks. He has tattoos and a hoodie on him probably looks different than a hoodie on others. We felt judged and profiled and I wanted to take my time to write this because it happened, and it wasn't right.

It has taken me over a month to write this review.  I did not want to review while I was emotional or angry.  I don't go into the city often for dinner but it was my daughters birthday and she wanted a special night.  I made reservations for 6 people on 8/15/21.  We arrived and had to wait for the car in front of us to discharge its passengers.  Three scantily-clad women climbed out of the car and immediately had to straighten  their outfits as the process of getting out of the car rearranged some vital body parts in congruence with public decency.  We followed these women into the restaurant and immediately questioned if this was the most appropriate restaurant for family dining.  Four of us went to the bar to wait for my daughter and her friend.   I received a call from my daughter who was outside the restaurant, in tears that she wasn't being allowed in because she didn't meet the dress code.  This was unimaginable to me as we just walked in after 3 provocative, indecently dressed women.  Not to mention that my daughter is an extremely conservative dresser.  Her friend had a collared shirt and pants. She had loose pants, sandals and a shirt.  I spoke with the manager who said her belly is showing and that's not allowed.  The bottom of her shirt met there top of her pants.  It was straight neck, sleeveless, not low cut...very tasteful.  I was completely confused as to how 3 women with plunging necklines, one so low you can see her belly were allowed in but a young teenager with no neckline was stopped at the door.  We were told bare midriffs we're not allowed. Yet, there was a man in the bar with gym shorts, tshirt and baseball hat---which is also not allowed per the website.  Clearly these guidelines are enforced subjectively by the management. How and why my teenage daughter was targeted as not being allowed into the restaurant is a reflection on the management and culture of the company.  We made these reservations in celebration of a special night,  Obviously, the manager preferred having provocatively dressed, scantily clad clientele patron the restaurant as opposed to more modestly dressed young women celebrating with their family.

For Chubby's, since this is a cheesesteak/sandwhich shop, the main goal here and attraction are their cheesesteaks. I ordered the cheesesteak. I'm all about simplicity with my cheesesteaks; onions (extra if they look really delicious), hot cherry peppers and American cheese with a ketchup cup on the side which I either drizzle inside the cheesesteak or dip the cheesesteak in the ketchup cup. How I eat the cheesesteak with ketchup depends on how messy the sandwich is. \n\nOne thing to note, there is a competing cheesesteak shop across the street called Dalessandro's and while they are indeed pretty good, have the long lines and rightfully so the recognition on social media, if you ask me I think Chubby's wins in the flavor category. Dalessandro's is going to wow you with the sheer large size of their cheesesteaks however I think Chubby's has a unique savory flavor element. Chubby's uses ribeye steak (most Philly cheesesteak shops do) and their steak is very tender and flavorful. I guess it also depends on the kind of cheese you order with your cheesesteak. I love the flavor combination of seasoned steak, onions and American cheese. I'm from the DMV and I recognize hometown Philadelphians opt for whiz cheese and in some cases provolone cheese however American cheese in my opinion is a more sophisticated move for those who are looking for a greater, deeper flavor experience and not just your normal steak experience.

My 2 star review was for the customer service. This was my first time at Chubby's and I was not familiar with the setup and procedures.  Even though I have been vaccinated the vaccine is not working on me because of some drugs that I am on so I have to be very careful and still will not eat inside a restaurant. Before stepping into Chubby's we noticed that there was a large tented area outside with plenty of picnic tables so we though that we could get our food and sit down outside like most considerate restaurants. After we got our food we stepped over to the area and we noticed signs up that said waitress service only. Ok, there is NOBODY here and no waitress present and had I known this I would have ordered here but it was too late. I thought that because there was nobody here and like most decent places that care about their customers they wouldn't mind us sitting here because we did just spend $30. We sat down and after 2 minutes a waitress came out and asked us to leave. Sorry, this is just bad management and I would NEVER return. We are still dealing with covid and some people still want to eat outside and everyone does NOT know the rules when first visiting. You need to be more flexible. I see that there is another review that has the same complaint.

This upscale fine-dining restaurant is great for special occasions when you are prepared to splurge because it is definitely not cheap. I love the low light setting with low table couch seating because it enhances the intimate atmosphere. Dress code is also more semi formal than casual. Steak wise, they have a good variety of options from standard to American Wagyu to Japanese Wagyu. They know how to prepare the steak to medium rare perfection. They also have a good selection of seafood platters as well. They served the quality of the ingredients and it is definitely worth the experience.\n\n*DINNER*\n\nHamachi Crudo - 4 slices of fresh hamachi with citrus ponzu and avocado jalape\u00f1o topping. The hamachi was very fresh and decadent. The citrus ponzu, not as sour as I thought, perfectly pairs well with the light hamachi flavor.\n\nSeared Diver Scallops - the scallops was cooked to PERFECTION. The texture was so soft and tender, not chewy at all, like you're eating raw scallops but it was fully cooked. The citrus sauce was the highlight. It was sour, which I love. The broiled mushroom was also very juicy but crispy, \n\nGlatt Kosher Ribeye - perfectly medium rare. A bit too salty for my liking. Think it would go very well with some sauce but we didn't get any. Good but not my favorite.\n\nAmerican Wagyu Filet Mignon - when you think about how tender and buttery Wagyu can be, this did its jobs. Easy to cut, easy to chew with just enough saltiness. Perfectly cooked to medium rare.\n\nTruffled mashed potatoes - great mashed potatoes, pretty heavy with the truffle flavor\n\nCreamed Spinach - not as heavy as I thought, very good pairing with the saltiness of the steak. \n\nBanana pudding creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - let's just say, this is the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had. \n\n*VERDICT*\nWould definitely come back again for another special occasion", "date": "2022-01-12 16:22:16", "user": {"name": "Lucy", "review_count": 94, "yelping_since": "2017-05-31 01:01:54", "elite": "2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.95, "fans": 15}}, {"review_id": "zl_WlTi9YmXhTYIABTFYtQ", "user_id": "HEZSS-fFZOSXmvjd8Me2Tw", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Barclay prime is the best restaurant that you can visit within the city.

Barklay Prime is the fourteenth Steven Starr Restaurant in my series so far... I arrived with my friend Robin. We were seated at a quaint table for two where we met our server, Glenn. I ordered a flute of, champagne, ployez-jacquemart, 'extra quality brut', ludes, france, as  I often like to start a meal with Champagne.  Robin was feeling a bit adventurous, and ordered a cocktail she never had before, The Metropolis, belvedere ginger zest, limoncello, thyme, white cranberry. For me, this was the beginning of an exciting evening. I enjoy sharing a meal with someone who is willing try new things ! We ordered our appetizers. Robin ordered Seared Diver Scallops, carrot, citrus, with broiled maitake mushroom, While I ordered, Oysters on the Half Shell*, half dozen, red wine mignonette. I also ordered a soup... Lobster Cappuccino.  While viewing the menu, Robin expressed an interest in, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, aged parmesan, arugula, lemon, porcini, scallop mousseline, but never having tried it, she ordered the Scallops, \"just to be safe\"... She didn't want to order it and find out she didn't like it. I have had Carpaccio and I like it. Since we started out trying new things I wanted to continue that theme, and suggested we order The Carpaccio and split it...Much to my excitement Robin agreed... Glenn brought us a Puff Pastry like bread that was made with Guyer Cheese and called a Popover... It came with a small bowl of soft butter that was sprinkled with sea salt... It was SOOO good ! The Oysters came out first. In my excitement, I regret that I didn't take a picture of them. They were served with a red wine mignonette and horse radish and were very good !  Robin never had Oysters before and was willing to give one a try. The excitement escalated ! Although she didn't like them very much, we both agreed, it was so much fun ! Next came The Carpaccio, Robins Scallops and my soup, Lobster Cappuccino. I had another flute of Champagne and Robin had another Metropolis as she found it to be \"Very refreshing!\" The two large Scallops were served with  a sauce of, carrot, and citrus,  and with broiled maitake mushroom. They were presented beautifully. The Lobster Cappuccino was assembled tableside. Four small Scallops Porcini Mushrooms and mousseline were presented in the center of the bowl. Glenn had a small pitcher of a \"Lobster Bisque\" like soup that he poured around  the bowl circling the contents highlighting them well. It was as beautiful as It was delicious ! I tried a bit of Robins Scallops and she tried a spoon full of my soup. Once again... DELICIOUS  !  Then we shared The Carpaccio ! Robin was pleasantly surprised at how much we both enjoyed it... ANOTHER FIRST for my adventurous  friend ! For our main course. Robin decided on, Ribeye prime 40 day dry-aged, with Kennett Square Mushrooms,  House Steak Sauce  and  Whipped Potatoes. I ordered, American Wagyu, Ribeye Cap, snake river farms, Idaho. with Creamed Spinach and Small Potatoes. Both Steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature ! And both were AMAZING !!! Glenn so aptly recommended a Ripasso by Valpolicella, Italy...It was a medium bodied red wine with a complex flavor profile that was excellent with my steak. After sampling my wine, Robin decided to stick with her Metropolis which by this point was quickly becoming her \"favorite drink.\" Naturally We tried each others' steak and while they were both EXCELLENT we both agreed that The Wagyu was the better tasting of the two... Now was time for desert !  We shared a slice of Lemon Cheese Cake that was sprinkled with small chunks of Dark Chocolate and crowned with a crispy vanilla wafer. We each enjoyed a cup of Cappuccino with our desert. I had a Sambuca with mine... I even managed to talk Robin into trying  Sambuca with her Coffee... One taste was enough for her and she enjoyed the rest of her cappuccino by itself... lol ! Again I regret that I did not take pictures... We had a BLAST ! It was SO MUCH FUN ! Everything was PERFECT ! In fact Robin said it may have been the \"best meal she ever had !\" It was made so with the expert help of Glenn, who was the perfect gentleman and most proficient server ! I had a wonderful time with wonderful people and wonderful food, and will not soon forget the evening or the meal...  https://barclayprime.com/.", "date": "2021-10-29 21:47:53", "user": {"name": "Thomas", "review_count": 38, "yelping_since": "2017-12-02 02:19:55", "elite": "2021", "average_stars": 4.89, "fans": 1}}, {"review_id": "KV4ELdP4E7x5q_lfHcJ3NQ", "user_id": "Bs9hv0zgdY8khKwTCmrNoQ", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Opulence is a word that comes to mind.

It's a pricey place, much more expensive than the restaurants I normally frequent, so I held off for a very special occasion. Well, that time came this year and I'm happy to say that it was a wonderful dinner. \n\nAmbiance: Relaxing and tastefully decorated. Like a modern, somewhat minimalist, library. The lighting was dim and perfect, the chairs were comfy armchairs. It was a comfortable setup for the hefty meal we were about to have. \n\nFood: Honestly, I eat steaks infrequently, so I kept my order basic. I got a bone-in New York strip cooked medium-rare. It was cooked perfectly and super delicious. My wife got a ribeye cooked medium, same results for her. We loved our steaks. We got three sides: creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and tater tots. All were delicious, but the tater tots, being so random on the menu, were such a standout... like deep fried cylinders of mashed potatoes. We also got the skillet cookie dessert, which was fantastic. Highly recommended if you want something sweet, the cookie is sectioned into chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and sugar, all were excellent. \n\nDrinks: The drinks were great, but they're extremely pricey. As delicious as they were, $17 for a cocktail is wild. I knew what I was getting into, so I don't think it's be fair to take off a star for this, but the price is ridiculous. And that's not even touching their $30 signature cocktails...\n\nService: Great. Our server was kind and accommodating. He answered all of our questions nicely and his suggestions were great. My only note is that he could have come by our table a little more, but I know restaurants are having staffing issues these days and the place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so it's all good. \n\nOverall: We loved our dinner at Barclay Prime and would absolutely go again. It's a pricey meal, 2 steaks, 3 sides, 2 drinks, a dessert and tip came out to a bit under $300 for two people, but it was worth it for delicious food on a special night.", "date": "2021-09-20 01:24:54", "user": {"name": "Greg", "review_count": 97, "yelping_since": "2011-10-18 01:24:43", "elite": "2015,2016,2021", "average_stars": 4.13, "fans": 3}}, {"review_id": "2lVsvlYheTBxS6cAuho35g", "user_id": "wQoe1WDVAYiYe0NoyLNDtw", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Amazing meal - the best I've ever had.

I'm a Stephen Starr fangirl, and I was determined to take him to the best of the Philadelphia restaurants in his empire, and I really couldn't have chosen better than this. \n\nAt the time that I made the reservation, only bar seating was available. I was initially disappointed because I didn't want to sit at the bar to eat dinner, but where we were actually seated was in a pretty lounge area in the front room, with plush seating and lovely lighting provided by candles and shaded wall lamps. Our server was extremely friendly and informative, going above and beyond in service quality (more on that in a bit)! We started with glasses of water, the Clover Days cocktail for my brother, and a delectable basket of popovers, which were flaky, light, rich and delicious all at once, and came with a whipped salted butter, though the popovers were so good on their own they didn't even need the butter.\n\nI'm a vegetarian, so I decided to go with the Caesar salad (I make an occasional pescatarian allowance), and an order of tater tots. My brother loves a good steak, but he never treats himself out to a steakhouse. So like the bossy older sister that I am, I told him, get whatever you want! And so he got the American Wagyu NY strip steak, and an order of truffle whipped potatoes. He's not as effusive as me, but he finished every bite of his meal with enthusiasm, and declared it one of the best steaks he'd ever had. He insisted that I try his whipped potatoes, and while they were very flavorful, the super-smooth creamy texture isn't for me. The tater tots, on the other hand, were incredible. The waiter thought I was nuts when I told him I've never actually had tater tots before. Pretty sure if I ever have them again, nowhere else will they have such a shatteringly crisp and deliciously salty exterior, with a perfectly cloud-like mashed potato interior. I confess I had to take most of the tasty little bites home because the Caesar salad was huge, and the dressing and grated cheese so good that I shamelessly mopped up the dish with the last of my popover. \n\nNow, getting back to the above and beyond service by our waiter - the steak and salad were brought out by a another member of the serving staff, (sooner than I expected), but no whipped potatoes or tots in sight. When our main server returned to check on us moments later, he exclaimed over the absence of our side orders, (turns out they were sent to another table) and remedied the oversight within minutes, all the while apologizing for the mixup. It was barely a delay at all, so my brother and I hardly minded, but he insisted on removing both items from our bill, effectively making them on the house. Maybe it's because I'm not used to restaurants with such stellar service, or maybe because I'm more used to having to point out missing food to the server myself, and getting an annoyed reaction, with the missing items eventually being brought out later. \n\nYes, Barclay Prime is quite expensive, but it's worth every penny, from the amazing service, to the beautiful decor, to the insanely delicious food. For a special occasion or if you want to super-treat someone (or yourself), this is definitely one of the top options in Philadelphia.", "date": "2021-09-06 21:07:15", "user": {"name": "Alexandra", "review_count": 286, "yelping_since": "2008-02-27 22:39:48", "elite": "2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.99, "fans": 103}}, {"review_id": "sIH_XohARh2ljvVgDSL5zw", "user_id": "86Sy0lj1Cxdv3MjT0NSfmQ", "business_id": "wbDRmtxaKRpBOjutvV6TEA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Simply put, Barclay Prime is the gold standard for steak houses in Philadelphia.

We ordered 3 dishes and about 6:30pm all three dishes were ready and delivered to our table. About 7:30pm, multiple waiter/waitress started rushing us. It began with something small and gentle as offering to take away any finished dishes, btw none of the dishes were finished yet. And we were literately still eating. Then it escalated to offering the sweet porridge as desert. Then, dropping the check on the table without being asked. Then the owner even started collecting the dishes. Despite we told them every time we were not finished. And through the entire time, there were more than one tables unoccupied, and there were nobody waiting outside the restaurant. \n\nFinally we decided not worth ruining a good reunion and paid the check with 15-20% tip. When the waitress collected the signed check, she literally laid all the signed receipts side by side on the table in front us and checked each tip line to make sure we paid or at least paid enough tip. You could tell because she pointed her pen to each tip line for a couple second and probably run the math in her head. This is very insulting to be honest ... as a customer to be \"rushed out\" and then checked for our math (or gratitude)? \n\nOne of my friends said .. oh they do that because some chinese do not tip. One, I believe most of chinese people do tip. Second, maybe the ones fresh off the boat dont understand how waiter/waitress get paid in US, then please explain to them and I believe they would be understanding. Third, if this is a real problem, maybe you should consider move the restaurant out of chinatown and renovate the place to target Americans. Fourth, and most important, if you require the customer to play American customs by paying tip, then please also follow the practice that -- gratitude needs to be earned --it's not regulated by any law that customer need to tip especially when you kick them out before they actually finish their meal!   \n\nSo, I will not return to that restaurant ... and do not recommend any chinese people do.

There really aren't many options if you're looking for the authentic cart-pushing dim sum experience and Ocean Harbor is your best bet. And it's even better if you have a Chinese speaking friend with you because the weekend process to get a table here during the house of 11am-12pm is pure and utter chaos when it's busy. They use to have a number system but now it's just a wait in line process on their stairs (people cram in there, masks are required, but just be wary if that's not your cup of tea - see what I did there) and you must be patient else it's all that more overwhelming. They will also escort you often to a table that hasn't been completely cleared and is dirty--but that's just part of their system--someone will come around shortly to clean it, but they like you standing awkwardly there so it's now \"reserved\". I don't necessarily understand their methods or the madness but the food is yummy and it's worth it. Dim sum is always pretty good and the pan fried beef noodles are my fave. If you're craving something interesting off and part of the secret menu -- order Ying Yang rice. It's fried rice with half topped with a white shrimp sauce and the other half topped with a ketchupy pork sauce. It's awesome and a must try if you're feeling adventurous.

There I ordered a bunch of dumplings and buns that I liked.\n\nWithin mins I was full from delicious dim sum. I do recommend parking a few streets over and walking over.

Dim sum for brunch? You better believe it.\n\nWokano is one of my favorite places to get weekend morning dim sum. It's simple, comforting, affordable, and relaxing.

You can not go wrong with these as part of your order!\n\nIt's filling, it's delicious, and it's easy on the wallet. \n\nI also love that when you sit down, you can eat relatively quickly: people are walking carts around the dining area with the food ready to go for you to select and enjoy. \n\nMy only issue is that, unless you live nearby and can walk there, I recommend you take a cab or rideshare. The shopping center parking lot is mayhem. It's packed with a food market and other stores in a small condensed area, so navigating your car in that parking lot is an endurance challenge.

The ambiance was that of a traditional dim sum restaurant with the metal carts and round tables. It's not the most ornate designs I've seen, but definitely still has the ambiance of a dim sum restaurant.\n\nNote: the waiters and waitresses here speak Mandarin, for the most part. We tried several dim sum, including shu Mai, Cheung fun, and soon juk goon. What was a bit disappointing was the service of the carts, as they were not moving around as frequently as we would have liked, rather they stood around the same area. Additionally, some of the dim sum wasn't really hot and fresh, rather feeling lukewarm and as if it had sat there for a bit.

However, a few times I've been here there have been huge issues with their sanitation standards and the service is atrocious. Most servers are okay, but one lady in particular, a tall middle age lady with black hair and a stank face always says the most nasty things and gives a horrible attitude totally unprovoked. I live near Chinatown so I don't come here very often but of the few times that I have, this has really stood out to me. Enough to the point that it prompted me to write this review. I've never in my Yelp history given such low ratings but just because they are busy doesn't mean they can treat people like crap. \n\nI came here and it was 10% full. It was my dads birthday, a big occasion and after a tumultuous few years regarding his health we decided to have our close family come out to a small dinner to celebrate. We asked for a small private room in the back so the kids could have their space. She said we \"wouldn't spend enough money to get the room\" I've been in the private rooms many times and have never heard of a minimum. The manager told her to bring us to the room and she refused. Not trying to argue with this lady we all left to the restaurant down the street and my dad is heated by the way we were just treated. Mind you, we never have a budget with food when celebrating special occasions. Regardless, we didn't have to explain ourselves to this lady let alone meet these made up requirements. \n\nThis is the same lady that told a family member that she \"shouldn't have worn flip flops\" when she slipped and fell on their wet bathroom floor and also the same lady that brought us our check and asked if we were ready to leave as soon as our food arrived last time and the time before that. We have a family of about 45 people. None of us want to return here despite the convenient location. We've all been offended by her in our experiences.

It is always packed head to toe, it's loud, and the outside is riddled with cigarette butts. The inside is just a large floor with a giant karaoke tv in the middle. To the right is a bunch of fish that you can choose for your meal, which is never appealing. The poor guys are dying right next to you as you eat. It's extremely unpleasant.\nIf you are going to eat from here, I'd suggest ordering to go!\n\nAlso, I noted the lobster was very good--and it is--but I would be wary. The last time I had it, my lobster's stomach came out and there were blue plastic chunks in it. It was horrible and completely turned me off from seafood for a while.

Unit Su Vege had remained take-out for quite some time after restaurants were allowed to reopen. I was going out for a friend's birthday, and she was very interested in the restaurant. As soon as we found out that dine-in was open, we headed in that weakened to celebrate. \n\nWe came in on a weekend, and the restaurant was busy without being ridiculously crowded. We had called beforehand to check in seat availability, and the owner was very welcoming and eager to have us come in. As soon as we came in, we were seated promptly. The menu is a combo of a Dim Sum menu where you check off quantities of small orders as well as a standard entree/dessert menu on the other side. \n\nOur server gave my friends and I plenty of time to look over what we wanted and check off our orders. We ended up ordering many smaller dishes from the Dim Sum menu. I went for the Cold Sesame Noodles, Vegetarian Roast \"Pork\" Buns, and Taro Croquettes. The rest of the table got other various Dim Sum items. \n\nThe food came out as a few items at a time due to the nature of how Dim Sum is prepared. As someone who eats A LOT of meat, this 100% vegetarian restaurant with mock meats was DELICIOUS. All of the food was extremely flavorful and high quality. I could tell while eating that the ingredients were fresh and that they were brought out as soon as they were cooked. All of my meat-eating carnivorous friends also enjoyed all of our food items thoroughly. We only had one Vegetarian Kung Pao Chicken Bun that we disliked. \n\nOverall, Unit Su Vege is a SUPER cool and unique place. They provide all the texture/flavor qualities of standard Asian dishes using mock meat, but ALSO use plenty of plant-based items like taro, tofu, seitan, and fresh vegetables. That gives the restaurant major appeal to meat eaters and plant-based eaters alike.

The first time I went a few months ago I got the tofu double mushroom, which was pretty, pretty good, but I guess I had expected something spicier, so I decided to hold off on a review until I had one of the spicy dishes (which is, after all, what they're most notable for). My partner DID have a spicy dish that first time, the chili szechuan tofu, and he really enjoyed it. \nWell, this time I decided to try their mapo tofu. Mapo tofu used to be one of my favorite Chinese entrees when I was living in New York, but I hadn't bothered to try it in the nearly 3 years I've been in Philadelphia, until yesterday. I am so glad I waited, because this mapo tofu was a REVELATION. It was definitely spicy, though not tear-inducingly so (fortunately). It tasted exactly the way I imagined a really great recipe I'd found (but never made) years ago would have - the oil in which the buttery soft cubes of tofu nestled fairly sang with the flavors of spicy broad bean, garlic, sesame oil and of course, the essential szechuan pepper. Seriously, this is the best mapo tofu I've ever had. \nMy partner went with his standby favorite, vegetable lo mein, and he described it as (one of) the best he'd ever had too. It included pieces of sauteed tofu, which one doesn't usually get in this particular dish.\nGreat prices for ample portions, and very quick and accommodating service (takeout during a pandemic, and both times I forgot to ask them not to pack utensils on the phone, but they quickly removed them from the bags each time I requested it when I went for pickup).

Homegirl's got 3 stars on Yelp -- you sure this is your fave?? Not gonna lie, I was doubtin him a lil there. But then I went with some friends, ate a few dishes, and was consequently enlightened. I love Yelp and Yelp has given me a lot of great insights (and free food haha) but y'all got this place wrong. Chu Shang Spicy is a freaking gem, and I've been back FOUR times since then. I don't even live close to Chinatown, and somehow Chu Shang has been my #1 visited spot this entire year!! That says something ok!! She a lil greasy, but she is delicious!!\n\nThis was my first time trying out the MaLa dry pot, and it was a fun time! Basically, the dry pot is a phat platter whose components (veg, noodles, meat, etc), size, and spice level you determine with a check-box menu. I can't recall the specific dry pots we've ordered, but I remember really enjoying the glass noodles, lotus root, cabbage, and fried tofu. No joke on the cabbage; it soaks up all the chili oil and complements any heavier components. It's a fun, communal way to enjoy a dish, and you really can't come here without giving the dry pot a go.\n\nAs for the plentiful other dishes available, I have liked everything I've tried, from the eggplant to the salt baked squid (all the salt baked meats are A-1 appetizers) and even the boring-sounding Szechuan Beef ended up being a culinary banger. You will probably leave the restaurant with a bit of a food coma and a few blocked arteries, but that's what the post-meal Chinatown stroll + bubble tea is for.

My friend and I went here for the first time this past Valentine's Day. When we arrived the hostess/manager didn't greet us. I assumed it was because she was busy.

My friend and I asked for a table for two and she asked us if we would \"help\" her and sit at the bar and tried to assure us that the bar was very comfortable. We insisted on a table and she begrudgingly gave us one. Honestly, at this point I was ready to leave because she had been so rude but it was 20 degrees outside and Valentine's Day so I knew we could end up just wondering around in the cold and waiting for an hour or more for a table. Our waiter was lackluster to say the least. He literally took our order and that was it. He never checked on us. The only time he came over was when I grabbed the drink menu but I'm sure that's because he gets paid more on the drinks. Then he quickly ran off when I said I was just looking. I normally really enjoy tipping waiters but I actually did not tip him because he did the bare minimum. The food was very basic. I got the American chopsuey and it essentially tasted like your local Chinise restaurant food. I love Chinise food but this was just not good.

In more recent years, \"Yunnan mixian\", \"Guilin mifen\", and Guangxi \"snail noodles\" have become very trendy in big cities all around China. We're finally getting some spillover in the US, and we are lucky to have Hidden Gem as our local purveyor for Philly's Chinatown.\n\nThese rice noodle dishes are part of a \"rice noodle belt\" that spans between Myanmar/Yunnan/Guangxi/Laos/Vietnam. That word \"fen\" is close kin to the famous Vietnamese \"pho\". The Guangxi varieties are really special though, served with fermented/pickled items making for a really intensely flavored soup. For the \"snail noodles\" and \"best friend noodles\", there is a unique funkiness than comes from fermented bamboo shoots--a little bit of a barnyard flavor (but intense and addictive umami) takes this soup noodle dish to another dimension. \n\nI'm so happy that we have these Guangxi-style rice noodles available in Philadelphia!\n\nAdded note: I highly recommend their house-made chile oil (which is also available for purchase).

It is found in the same building as 1st Asian Supermarket, making it convenient to eat and shop for our Southeast Asian grocery needs. Both are closer to our Bucks County home, saving time compared to either Chinatown (traffic & parking) or Washington Avenue (traffic). \n\nI was the sole customer when I walked in around 3 P.M. The cordial manager got up from reading the newspaper and seated me at the table next to her and handed me their multi page menu. Another friendly woman came out of the kitchen with a pitcher of cold water, to answer questions and take my order. That was simple - Pho Tai and Roast Pork Banh Mi (This is a pho house, after all.) \n\nTen minutes later she was back with the \"Small\" bowl of steaming beef noodle soup requested, and a side plate of exceptionally fresh standard accoutrement (sprouts, sliced jalapeno, Thai basil sprigs and lime wedge). I took a pair of new wood chopsticks and flat bottomed spoon from the table holder and doctored the pho to my taste, paying attention to pull apart the nest of noodles lying beneath the surface of the dark broth (Northern Vietnamese style). \n\nThe flavor profile displayed some depth and had been simmering in a large pot for a long time. It wasn't quite as rich as Pho 75 or Pho Ha, but it was very good and didn't require help from the Sriracha bottle rocket on the table. It was plenty spicy with the addition of the jalapeno. \n\nI was content to slurp away and patiently lift noodles out of the caldron and fold them onto the spoon before shoveling them into my mouth. \n\nThe Banh Mi arrived minutes later. It was a full sized sandwich on decent French baguette, cut in half. Like the pho, it was larger than anticipated, especially for $6!  It was loaded with dark roast pork, daikon radish, carrot, aioli and cilantro. I added a long squirt of Hoisin to bring up the savoriness of that combo, and took a bite. From crusty roll through crisp daikon and ultimately tender pork, it was delicious and captivating. It was a complete oral and tactile experience. One of the best sammys I've enjoyed since Ocean Grove, California, the capital of Vietnamese America. \n\nAlong with China Gourmet, the excellent dim sum emporium also in that building, the presence of Pho Le Lai make St. Vincent Street a strong destination for your Asian taste buds and culinary needs.", "date": "2020-10-25 15:45:48", "user": {"name": "Gerald", "review_count": 3131, "yelping_since": "2012-12-16 23:26:39", "elite": "2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021", "average_stars": 3.68, "fans": 703}}, {"review_id": "jgS4OoggHDnXc6WNAkwCAg", "user_id": "Qp4MYYSB5_R2r2JsE0HvKA", "business_id": "up5Czl7yXI1LpZ_6Ys2Ahw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Came here because Pho 75 was unfortunately not offering dine in EVEN THOUGH one of their reviews said they were open for dine in - whatever though, because now i found this amazing super sweet spot!! \n\nthe food: you know the pho boutta be good when the broth isn't super clear - deep flavors and the noodles aren't super soggy like most places!
