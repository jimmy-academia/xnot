I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \n\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \n\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \n\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \n\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \n\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?!

The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\n\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn't fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\n\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\n\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\n\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno's down the street and get a full cheese serving if you're after a cheese plate.\n\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they're just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\n\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli's were also overcooked and I'd swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\n\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they're famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\n\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.", "date": "2015-01-07 16:50:51", "useful": 12, "funny": 4, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 439, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2012-07-04 13:19:17"}}

I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\n\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I'm hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\n\nWe tell her we're waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I'm baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\n\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\n\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it's apparently so beneath her. \n\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \n\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.", "date": "2016-01-10 21:13:14", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 72, "average_stars": 3.42, "yelping_since": "2015-05-10 03:28:48"}}

The two? three? hostesses looked really confused, but then told us they were going to seat us upstairs in a few minutes. My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\n\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\n\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

Eveything done as if one where in Italy.\nThe second time, we brough friends who were just delighted as were we.\nThe third time we came with more friends and loved it all.\nThe fourth time, not so much, but hey anyone can have an off night.\nThe fifth time, when I saw the addition of the ubiquitous dessert tray, I knew that instead of remaining true to Italy, they were trying to assimilate to American tastes.\nLast night 3/14/15, we arrived at 6:15.

He said \"six.\"  There were five on the plate and he said that sometimes he sees six on a plate and sometimes five. I thought those things should have been settled in the kitchen and made known to the servers.\nThe chef had adulterated the oysters with flavors and something sweet so that it taste like anything but oysters. Because I said I expected oysters, the owner sent up another five.  Yes, they were plain with adulterated cocktail sauce but were not the taste of great Blue Points.

I went with a Bacio gelato and an Amaretto gelato, being held nicely in a toasted brioche bun. To be honest this was ok, the brioche seemed a little too dry, and the gelato not so creamy. This is not a slam on Gran Caffe, with everything that have to offer, but it seemed a little off to me. I will say this though, their dessert menu looks amazing, with endless options. \n \nUnique dishes that will have your taste buds going into full tilt mode along with their weekly tasting menu. Their tasting menu is designed to bring you through different regions of Italy, experiencing the dishes from that region. If that doesn't raise an eyebrow you should checkout their happy hour menu, and specials. I feel Gran Caffe L'Aquilla is an establishment that needs to be a part of your rotation.

Hopefully you're seated in Corina or Anastaysia area, but if not, don't fret their staff will make sure you'll have the very best dining experience.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \n\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \n\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \n\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \n\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.  Great service and food.  Can't be better than that.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that's all.\n\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions. That's why it seemed inexpensive. But we stay.\n\nThe waiter: \"Any questions?\"\nWife: \"Yes -- between the (listed entree), the (listed entree), and the (listed entree)...\"  [looks at waiter]\nWaiter:  \"What's the question?\"\n\n(Strike one.)\n\nWife:  \"Which is your favorite?\"\nWaiter then seems to struggle with recommendations.

I just learned that word yesterday...\"\nMe: \"OK, there you go...\"\nWaiter: \"Well, it doesn't have the pesto in it...\"\nMe, interrupting: \"Pesto???!...\"\nWaiter: \"Amatriciana typically has a pesto base to it, but this one doesn't.\"\nMe: \"An ITALIAN guy made Amatriciana for me, and it doesn't have pesto in it. -- Maybe in *some* region they make it like that...\"  (allowing him to save face)\n\n(Strike three.)\n\nI decide upon tagliatelle alla panna, a safe choice.\n\nWaiter brings bread.\nMe: \"Can I have some butter for the bread?\"\nWaiter: \"It's typically served with olive--\"\nMe: \"I know.

She said it was interesting, but I would have thrown it out rather than eat it, and I'm in love with all things pasta. \n\nSo, to sum it up, I didn't experience a 4-1/2 star restaurant.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I've just discovered) ordering delivery!\n\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You'll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn't totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L'Aquila apart.\n\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that's in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini's Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I'd been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there's a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\n\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don't think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it's definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y'all who don't like overly sweet desserts.\n\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don't have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it's probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn't cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won't get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\n\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\n\nTo sum it up, you really can't go wrong with Caffe Gran L'Aquila, no matter what you're looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don't do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn't learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \n\nUpon arrival our table wasn't ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren't able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren't near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I'm glad we stayed...\n\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it's supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I'm a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \n\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I'm no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \n\nNow as you may know, I'm not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There's something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \n\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \n\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn't have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \n\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.", "date": "2016-06-16 16:59:42", "useful": 7, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 1402, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-04-19 19:23:27"}}

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\n\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\n\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\n\nFood: \nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\n\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\n\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\n\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\n\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\n\nFourth course: \nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\n\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\n\nTips/Takeaways:\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly", "date": "2021-09-20 23:43:11", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 218, "average_stars": 3.83, "yelping_since": "2018-07-14 20:47:36"}}

The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.", "date": "2021-12-15 02:19:20", "useful": 7, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 286, "average_stars": 3.99, "yelping_since": "2008-02-27 22:39:48"}}

If you're looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\n\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I've experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won't regret it!\n\nSERVICE: 5/5\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn't guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I've had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \n\nFor dessert, I couldn't decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I'm very grateful.\n\nFOOD: 4/5\nThe only reason why I'd give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don't get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I'd give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here's a run-down of my impression:\n\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I've had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\n\nFIRST COURSE:\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\n\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I'm lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \n\nSECOND COURSE:\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\n\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\n\nTHIRD COURSE:\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\n\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven't tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I've tried tasted like this one.\n\nDESSERT\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn't mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\n\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can't say I'm completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\n\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn't noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison's sake, in 2016 and '17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\n\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\n\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\n\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\n\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

We were a party of 3 and she said there'd be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn't enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn't even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \n\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\n\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn't taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\n\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.  The only time we saw the server was the obligatory check in on us after the meal was delivered and to bring the check.\n\nWe get it... The restaurant closes, you want to clean the tables and get everything cleaned up, but come on.\n\nAll in all, the experience was less than ideal and sadly, didn't experience the \"amazing\" experience that others did.", "date": "2021-11-15 04:15:58", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 360, "average_stars": 3.81, "yelping_since": "2011-07-09 22:36:27"}}

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There's a good chance if you're just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn't carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we've ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It's also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \n\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn't finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \n\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn't recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I've ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I've had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don't hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I've ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \n\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife's dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn't even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef's truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn't actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn't stand. The ravioli's filling wasn't meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \n\nI've never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp's overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\n\nUPDATE:\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don't know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\n\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I'd just respond here. First of all I've only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \n\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant's I've written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I've written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I've eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \n\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible. My taste in Italian food is clearly not the problem here.", "date": "2016-08-18 17:34:01", "useful": 17, "funny": 9, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 2227, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2006-10-24 22:40:11"}}

You know, that argument you have with your best friend every few years that makes you wonder why you're friends in the first place.  Then a week or so goes by and you realize it's only natural, and it's OK not to see eye to eye on everything!  I forgive you Yelp and I'm not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.  And by greet I mean, come over and ask if we were ready to order when we didn't even have menus yet.  He didn't introduce himself, mention any specials or crack a smile. (under a mask that was half off his face)\n\nWe ordered a prosciutto plate which was fairly dry with some wilted greens.  I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don't remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there's more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \n\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it's the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won't go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.  I have no sympathy for people who dial it in at work, put no effort and expect optimal results.  All this coupled with mediocre food qualifies for a 2 star rating. I understand I'm an outlier here, but it was what it was.", "date": "2021-08-14 03:30:31", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 370, "average_stars": 3.42, "yelping_since": "2011-10-10 04:33:05"}}
