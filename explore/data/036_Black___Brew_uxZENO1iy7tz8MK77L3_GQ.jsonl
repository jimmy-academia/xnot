But the bourgeois bohemians leave nothing in their wake, so the Italian mom-and-pops that don't close will simply adapt with the times and start going upscale (and probably make a killing for the people who came to the nabe seeking something authentic, all the while squelching it through the higher rental rates that they command).\n\nEnough of that though.

Anyways, this review is about the food and not the delivery service. \n\nI ordered \"The Breakfast Burrito\" which was supposed to come with eggs, beans, cheese, sour cream, guac and salsa. I opted for the vegan option which replaced the cheese and sour cream with vegan options (I am lactose intolerant, not vegan). I also opted for the gluten free wrap. However, I noted on the order that I am allergic to cilantro, so they omitted the guac and salsa (which in hind sight is kind of sucky because both of things are delicious if you don't ruin it with cilantro...I digress).

I really wish they would have reduced the price for omitting the guac and salsa though. However, and I'm sorry to have to say this, the gluten free wrap was trash.

I would begin by saying something like \"Meh,\" but I really, really @###ing hate it when people say \"Meh.\"\n\nI'd like to give this place three stars or at least two and a half but as I'm bound by whole numbers it's getting two for now.  Upon moving to the area I had high hopes for the place since it seems to be fairly non-cliquey and serves a wide variety of things, including breakfast all day (and who doesn't like breakfast all day?).\n\nUnfortunately I'm just not that impressed with the food.  I had the \"turkey reuben\" on my first visit.  If you want to reinvent the reuben go ahead, but at least do it well.  It was served on triangles of pita bread (??), contained almost no sauerkraut and dressing and had a lot of cheese.  So basically this wasn't a reuben at all, it was a half-assed quesadilla on pita without salsa.\n\nA couple of other times I've had their breakfast fare and found it to be pretty mediocre.  I don't think they use high-quality ingredients.  The worst of all was today when I got a brownie from the pastry case and it was the worst brownie I've ever had in my life, extremely dry with a cardboard taste.  I asked the guy working behind the counter to throw it away.  He was nice enough to offer me something else, but I just decided to cut my losses, take my latte and head down to Artisan Boulanger/Pastissier for a real pastry.\n\nI must say that at least I've found all the staff very friendly there, including the aforementioned guy, who I'm pretty sure has some nasty b.o., but at least he's accommodating.  I'm not saying I won't return.  It's a close, easy breakfast.  I haven't had their coffee but have no complaints about the espresso drinks.\n\nSide note:  they need to adopt a no-shirt, no service policy.  I was in there a few days ago and the presence of a shirtless bozo-the-clown-haired hipster really brought down the ambience for me as a customer.\n\nAs another reviewier mentioned, we seem to have a Hobson's Choice between this place and B2 (which I also don't care for).

Amidst the sea of pretense that you typically encounter in Philadelphia coffee shops, it's refreshing to come across a cafe that is relaxed, has a really nice and open atmosphere, and doesn't have a staff who looks like they just came back from the most recent show at Kung Fu Necktie. \n\nIt really is the entire package. Black & Brew has really good coffee, and their prices aren't ridiculous (unlike a certain B2, cough cough). While I typically stick with plain black, they offer creative fancy latte drinks and a variety of smoothies which you can amp up with all sorts of healthy things if you so choose. They also have really good food, which ranges from simple to decadent. The prices are fair, and while the portions aren't super huge, it's enough to fill you up and make you feel like you're getting your money's worth. Honestly, my favorite thing to get there is a simple bagel with hummus and a tomato slice because whatever they do to their hummus is awesome. The hint of cinnamon - and it really is just a hint - is something I would've never thought to put in hummus but it's sooooooso good. Also - they have a list of weekly rotating specials so things are always exciting in terms of food. \n\nBlack & Brew is also really community oriented. They offer classes on all sorts of topics, and I believe the one coming up next is with a nutrition counselor or something about helping people break a sugar addiction. Along with that, local artist and Philadelphia celeb Isaiah Zagar's famous murals line the outside walls (but really, where isn't he these days?), while neighborhood artists get the chance to line the inside with their up-and-coming great works. \n\nI'm taking off a star for two reasons, though. The first is the hours. They aren't open past 7pm during the week, and 4pm on the weekends. I'm the type of person who can't study in my apartment because I associate my apartment with laziness and doing nothing, not school work, so it's kind of a bummer when one of my favorite cafes isn't open late enough for me to get a caffeine fix prior to a study session. I'm not suggesting staying open to midnight, but 9 or 10pm would be greatly appreciated (this is a nod to 90% of cafes, to be honest). Secondly, I was in their yesterday studying for a test in the early afternoon and they kept blaring music that would make more sense being played in a club, not a cafe (Rhianna? Katy Perry? T-Pain? Come on now). I know I said that I like how this place is lacking in pretense, but perhaps that's a double-edged sword because I would've killed for something more mellow and folky.

We said several times we were vegan and asked for tofu and no cheese with the burrito - the burrito came out with cheese and she was super frustrated with us when we sent it back, still clearly not understanding what vegan meant. The whole thing was a huge hassle and the food was not good - def would just check out another brunch/coffee spot if you're looking for plant based options!", "date": "2019-07-28 23:31:57", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 7, "average_stars": 3.71, "yelping_since": "2014-05-07 20:22:07"}}

Passyunk on the edge of Passyunk Square.  This shop opens at 7 am, so you can get your coffee fix in the area while running your errands or heading to/from the gym or work.  There are a lot of vegetarian and some vegan selections at this spot (I would say about 50% of the menu), as well as a hearty selection of sandwiches and salad for meat eaters.  \n\nI came here on my way to play football on a beautiful Saturday morning.  The inside of the restaurant was bustling and the outside sidewalk tables were filled to capacity.  I ordered a coffee and egg, cheese, and veggie sausage bagel sandwich to go.  The coffee was quick and delicious.  I would describe the coffee as a rich medium roast. They also have an espresso machine and can make you any variety of specialty coffee drinks.  The bagel was decent (after four years of living in NYC, I have some bagel snobbery issues)--they have several options--I went with everything.  The veggie sausage was so good (and convincing) that I checked several times to make sure I wasn't eating pork.  The egg was scrambled (I wish there was an option to get it over-easy--though I probably could have if I asked) and the cheese tasted like cheddar.  Overall the sandwich was huge, relatively cheap for a non-fast food restaurant (it was ~$6 total for the coffee and sandwich), and good.  My wait time from ordering to walking out the door was probably around 7 minutes--not bad at all for a busy Saturday morning.\n\nI will definitely be back again to sample what looked to be a delicious lunch menu.  They offer \"daily\" specials on their web site, as well, so you can check out the changing menu before you go.", "date": "2014-04-14 17:32:51", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 306, "average_stars": 3.82, "yelping_since": "2012-01-26 14:10:06"}}

My favorite Rival Bros next door was crowded, so I come here for the first time to try my luck. It was around lunch time, so the place was crowded with people eating, interspersed with a few others who were in their laptop. The first thing I noticed when I stepped in is how crowded everything was. The front is crammed full of small tables and there were barely any room to walk at all. Each table is tiny and definitely challenging to fit more than a plate and a cup of coffee. It's also very loud, which was to be expected when there are so many people, but even in the afternoon when the lunch-time crowd had left, there was still the loud music being blasted here. While I had a decent amount of work done and the wifi was reliable, it wasn't a super pleasant experience by any means, between maneuvering my coffee and laptop on such a tiny table to try to hear myself think over the loud conversations, I think I would give this place a pass the next time I want to work at a cafe.\nOn another note, their breakfast and lunch menu looked quite comprehensive, so maybe come here if you just want food. I can't comment on how good the food is as I only had the drinks here.", "date": "2019-11-16 20:18:38", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 107, "average_stars": 4.32, "yelping_since": "2017-01-19 04:35:24"}}

The wife, babe and I came here about a month or 2 ago for brunch and we both had the huevos rancheros. The place was super busy, but even still, I was impressed with the service. Our waitress checked on us a bunch and was super nice even though we were outside. \n\nI was excited about our food choices at first because gluten free cornbread is not easy to come by! But alas, this was not cornbread nor was this a \"special.\" More like unspecial corn flavored styrofoam. The rest of the food was alright, but is it really that hard to fry up some eggs? The only positive thing was that there was a lot of food so at least we left feeling full. \n\nThe second time was today. The place was empty, so no one was in a rush. We walked in to the person at the counter loudly sighing, slamming down the phone and then immediately looking at us. She then started complaining about telemarketers to us as if we told them to call.....cool bro. Anyway, we awkwardly laughed at the complaints and ordered. I got the paleo hash with a green smoothie and the wife got a grilled cheese and a la colombe iced latte on tap. \n\nLiterally everything we got was a fail. The only things that were hot on my plate were the eggs and bacon. The potatoes were soggy and tasted like they were cooked hours before and then quickly thrown into a pan to warm. The mushrooms were either from a can or also cooked hours before or both. The red pepper was the worst offender of all and was again either out of a can or was just on its way out. There was supposed to be salsa, but I only saw 2 tiny pieces of tomato and maybe a 1/4 of a teaspoon of watery red sauce. Also, there were no apple slices on the plate at all....though I doubt it would have helped. My smoothie definitely had no green powder in it and it most definitely did have ice. I'm going to assume it was a half of a banana, a lot of ice and a couple of blueberries. It was also not blended all the way so since I didn't have a spoon handy, I drank a few sips and quickly gave up trying to suck a chunk of banana through the straw. \n\nMy wife's grilled cheese tasted fine but as you can see in the picture, it was tiny! I'm going to assume they used only bread ends since there is no way that was supposed to be the regular size. Her coffee was also literally one sip of coffee and 98% ice. Basically $5 for air. Thanks. \n\nTo top it off, the person at the counter was really unprofessional. She was dragging her feet around the restaurant muttering to herself for a while, tripped a couple of times (which is fine...I'm clumsy as well) and then accidentally dropped something on the floor and yelled out \"UUUGGHH PUT A BULLET IN MY HEAD!\" I understand having a shit day, but dude really?

It's a corner location. The spot is well decorated and seating is set up well. The menus on chalkboards are confusing as there are multiple boards that aren't in the same place. The directions for ordering are hard to see because of a lot of text including inspirational quotes (which gives a great vibe). You can't clearly see the \"order here\" text above the counter. The reason why I am giving this review a 2 out of 5 is because when I walked in and said \"hi\" to the host/cashier I was ignored. My fiancee and I were left standing around waiting until we figured out the ordering procedure ourselves. We ordered and were told to bring the number to any table, but weren't told that coffee wouldn't be brought to the table. The host left for a break shortly after our food came. The food was above average. The kitchen staff was very nice and when she dropped off the food she let us know that the coffee had to be picked up, but the attitude of the barista was standoffish and incredulous when I explained that we didn't realize that we were supposed to pick up the coffees from the bar. The barista didn't say a word and just stared at me while pouring the coffee. The great design and mood setting of the decor of this spot was undercut by the negativity, poor service and confusing ordering mechanics. I have also downgraded the review to a 1 star after reading the owners responses to reviews. It is clear that management is defensive and probably a root cause for the negativity of staff.", "date": "2019-08-04 18:22:05", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 5, "average_stars": 4.2, "yelping_since": "2013-09-24 21:30:13"}}
