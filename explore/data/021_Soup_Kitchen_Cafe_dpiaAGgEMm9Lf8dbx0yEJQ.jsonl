The crabcake sandwich, tomato basil soup, and pulled pork are consistent winners. The downer is that after several visits over a period of months, it's become apparent that the service ranges from barely acceptable to really poor. It's not uncommon to see just two servers trying to handle a full dining section, the coffee bar, the drinks bar, and the register, which means that table visits are rare,  water glasses sit empty, and patrons wait to be seated even with empty tables. And a few weeks ago, we tried to avoid those problems by ordering their food for take-out catering for a small party, but after ten-odd phone calls, many of which went unanswered during business hours or answered and then not followed up on, we just gave up and ordered a Primo's tray.

No, SK differs greatly from the .pdf menu crowd. Their .com leads only to their menu, hours, and location. Shocking, isn't it? If only the Starrs and Garces could follow this lead, instead of doing their best impression of this: http://lobsterdonut.com/restaurant-excited-to-unveil-hassle-filled-web-site/\n\nInside the physical domain, nothing outperforms the meatloaf sandwich with bacon ($8.50), served on a fantastic baguette. There's not a super special recipe behind the meatloaf, it's just moist and done perfect. The supporting cast of aged white cheddar & tomato-thyme mayo deliver the warm and creamy flavor.\n\nPickled green tomatoes hide under covers of fontina, munster, and swiss ($6) and the grilled cheese is bookended by two great pieces of sourdough bread. The tomato's preserve treatment provides a smoother, less briney taste than traditional pickles while still serving a familiar acidic kick. Get it with soup and you'll be happy.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich ($8.50) is fine, but not special. The nuance I think they're going for by employing apple/red cabbage and jalapeno aioli is mostly wiped out by the suffocating heat of jalapeno seeds. Also, each sandwich carries a small tote of chickpea salad on its side. A gentle squeeze of lemon gives it a fresh, light taste without any puckering acridness. \n\nAn odd issue, though, is the smell. Even if you don't take a to-go bag you're still bringing home the kitchen's handiwork on your clothes due to the poor ventilation. It's a mild annoyance to wear your lunch on your shirt when you haven't even spilt anything, but not enough to bypass Soup Kitchen completely.", "date": "2012-12-11 20:15:29", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 109, "average_stars": 3.61, "yelping_since": "2009-10-09 18:22:18"}}

The place is within walking distance, which is nice, and when I arrived the place was empty. There were literally 2 people working, some flies, and a ton of empty seats. Nothing wrong with that, however, and I fully understand it being dead for the time and day of the week. \n\nMy first and only complaint is that I still don't understand how they want you to operate when you are there. There is a sign that says to have a seat wherever you'd like, so I did. I waited for someone to come take my order, but no one seemed interested. I assumed that maybe you were to order at the counter, despite there being no \"order here\" signs. When I did order at the counter they looked at me like I was doing it wrong...I'm still not sure if they come to you to order or not. \n\nThe food was great, decently priced, and a reasonable portion. The pulled pork was delish and surprisingly spicy. I love spicy foods, but I could see someone with sensitivity to spice being caught off guard by this one. The sandwich came with a side of chick pea salad which was surprisingly good. My only complaint with the sandwich is that I didn't really see or taste and BBQ sauce on it. This seems to be a trend now days, and I'm not particularly fond of it. When I eat a pulled pork sandwich I expect that sucker swimming in delicious BBQ sauce. Even so, it was scrumptious and hit the spot. The other confusing part was whether or not I was supposed to bring my dishes to them after I'm done eating. I just don't get the procedure they are going for...perhaps I'm just over thinking it.

Very seldom does a simple lunch leave me beaming for the rest of the day. Like a first kiss, it was playing over and over again in my head. Dramatic, but true. Soup Kitchen Cafe is my new favorite lunch spot, with ample parking to boot.\n\nSoups and new dishes are listed on chalkboards, neatly stenciled with colored chalk. The menu is available at the front counter.\n\nFood: A carefully thought out menu, and the price is right! You can get half a sandwich and cup of soup for $8.50; I got the spicy watermelon gazpacho, and it uh-mazing! Chilled and refreshing. Served with drizzled olive oil and garnished with dill. There was just enough heat (spice) to leave a subtle, smoldering burn in the back of your throat. The slight, sweet watermelon notes balanced well with it's tomato base, and was absolutely delectable; I couldn't stop eating it.\n\nI got the homemade meatloaf sandwich (Smoked bacon, aged white cheddar, and tomato-thyme mayo on a baguette), a true gazpacho sidekick; I've added a photo of this beaut for visual aid. Holy shnikeys! The bread was fresh and soft, yet still substantial. The meatloaf was moist and filled the bread to the edges; all the flavors worked in a perfect symphony to yield perhaps, the perfect sandwich. I really admire their attention to detail and delicately balanced flavors.\n\nBreakfast sandwiches look great. Sides look delicious and range from $2-4. I have my eye on the mac n' cheese (aged chedder and gruyere).\n\nTheir Cucumber Lemonade is THE BOMB!! So delicious and refreshing! No soda fountains here; awesome! They offer yummy coffee/iced coffee and also a vanilla chai milkshake that I will surely try at a later date.\n\nDecor: modern, hipster, trendy, charming are all ways to describe this place. Teal and brown walls, modern pieces, local hipster art, Motobecane (1-cylinder) motorcycle which oddly, doesn't look out of place...it's a really nice area to chill out. Couches and comfy chairs are also readily available for your buns.\n\nSuper Plus: The sincerely polite manager/server (owner maybe?) personally came to our table to apologize for some bothersome flies; he explained that hurricane Irene had taken out their AC a few days previous and they had to have the doors open for a couple days. Their service is unmatched in my book.\n\nWill I go back? You bet your sweet a** I will! Already anxiously waiting my next visit.\n\n*You can call ahead and order.\n\n**I also overheard them saying that they will be doing dinner soon.

It is totally comfort filling food. \n\nWe obviously went with a soup, since they are supposed to be one of the best in Philly at soup. Both of us had Tomato Basil. \nIt is unlike any soup I have had before. It was delicious. Clearly it is home made as it had little chunks in it. You had sweetness from the tomato and basil flavor. I swear a cheese flavor in it as well. \nWe both did soup and a sandwich and I thought the bowl would be small, it was not. At first I thought they must have something wrong, but they did not. \nI also had a cucumber lemonade that was outstanding. You could taste both and it fit with the wholesome meal. \nNow on to the sandwich portion of the meal. My son went the obvious grilled cheese. When he pulled the halved sandwich apart the cheese just strung out in a large quantity. This was to my sons absolute glee, he gained a large smile at seeing the stringy cheese. They are generous with the cheese, I swear it was a half inch of the goodness between the bread. I had a taste of the grilled cheese, I ate half to be exact. It was delicious. The bread was fabulous and likely home made. \nMy sandwich I had a half meatball sandwich. It was delicious and my only wish was that I ordered a whole sandwich and not a half. It was earthy and homey, a true comfort type of food. \nI really loved the place and want to go back. The place is spacious and bright. The walls could use some cleaning, but that is about it. \nTo finish it off, my son really wanted dessert and we got the bill before they asked. So we ordered a cookie on the way out as we paid at the cashier. I'm not sure she charged us for it. When I pointed it out, the hostess waved us on and said it is not a big deal.

Today my husband and I finally made it out, and it was DE.LISH!\n\nWe went around noon, and it was difficult for me to decide if I wanted to go the breakfast or the lunch route...so I took a different path: dessert! I got the brownie batter waffle, which is exactly what it sounds like, served with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and fudge. It was mind blowing. Seriously. The waffle was so soft and not at all like I imagined the texture to be. I thought it'd be a lot \"heavier\" but it really wasn't. This dish could get you into trouble...\n\nMy husband went the lunch route. He got the soup and \"half\" a sandwich. The soup was sausage and bean, which was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of heat to it. He ordered the meatloaf sandwich, and as soon as he saw it he said, \"THAT'S A HALF A SANDWICH!?\" It was definitely enough to fill you up. The sandwich came with cheese and bacon, but the real highlight was, of course, the meatloaf. It was soooo juicy and definitely not like your mother's meatloaf.\n\nWe also had to get a side of macaroni and cheese, because I read on here that it was a winner. Whoever wrote that review was right. The gruyere cheese was the perfect choice - and I like that they're not shy with the pepper.\n\nAnother highlight: the cucumber lemonade. It takes a lot of sweat to churn out one of these bad boys, but I thank the staff for doing so, because it was SUPER refreshing. Don't worry, the lemon doesn't get lost with the cucumber, it only gets enhanced. I'm going to have to get that drink again.\n\nThings I want to try: their house breakfast sandwich. I can't remember exactly what's in it, but I know for certain that it includes asparagus and some type of meat that resembled prosciutto. It looked great, and I think it's served on an everything bagel (my favorite). Also: the chai milkshake. Need I say more about why I want to try that?\n\nAnyway, this place is a gem.

I also had the chicken salad sandwich, which had a nice twist to it as it had something with a crouton type consistency in it , and the crab cakes. The stand out dish was certainly the pulled pork which I hear is nominated for best in philly. Topped with sliced apples the pulled pork packs a light kick courtesy of the jalapeno sauce. Apples? Jalapeno dressing? Pork? I know what you're thinking.....Trust me it works. Every bite was moist, juicy and delicious. Also i'm not sure what it means but the pork tasted very \"fresh\" , like \"porky\" but not in a gamey sense...... if that makes sense.

As a server and bartender, I never leave less than 20% and typically leave 30%. However when a server doesn't give me any indication that she wants my business let alone my tip, I feel there's no need to show my appreciation of her service. There was also no manager on the floor to voice my complaints to and I'm not the kind of person to ream a server over making a mistake and then showing zero regard for her customers. I'll just leave and never come back,", "date": "2013-11-11 21:41:16", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 5, "average_stars": 4.5, "yelping_since": "2013-11-11 21:36:03"}}

The decor is clean and simple with plants hanging in big, wide windows. Some of the tables are made out of slabs of wood, with a bar area that can accommodate about 6 people. There are nice people (and dog) watching opportunities if you're facing the two little parks across from the cafe. \n\nThe Reanimator coffee they serve is too strong for me - I prefer La Colombe - but my husband loves it. I give them props for using a local coffee company, though. The Build-Your-Own breakfast sandwich was very hot and very delicious. Mine arrived with two fluffy eggs, melty cheese, and just ripe avocado on a brioche bun. You can also get two types of tomato, caramelized onions, or several types of meat on your sandwich, and there's the option to get it on an everything bagel.\n\nOkay, so we were there at 10am, but felt the need to try a soup since the place is called \"Soup Kitchen\". We had the tomato basil, which was far superior to most tomato basil soups I've had, which are usually watery. This one was creamy, nicely spiced, and tasted like it might have been flavored with sherry or some other wine. I didn't really taste basil, but the soup was so good, it didn't bother me.\n\nThe menu is on the simple side, but the options are varied and tasty. I would love to stop in for lunch the next time I'm in Philly.", "date": "2018-09-14 15:59:25", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 149, "average_stars": 4.54, "yelping_since": "2014-06-29 19:47:27"}}

The soup was mediocre at best! The server woman with blonde hair and glasses didn't gave enough of a good impression to ever come back here.

While I understand it's one hour away from closing and you want to go home please have the decency and courtesy to ask the customer if it's for in or to go. This action of hers just made her seem lazy, careless, and seem like she hated her job specially the way she smashed those receipts with anger in the holder spike stick bill fork. When I mentioned this to her as she brought my order all she said was \"you could of told me\" putting the blame back on me. I was completely confused as to why I needed to tell her it's called customer service and it's your job to ask not just assume or shoved your option you see fit or both. After mentioning this to her she gave me a horrible attitude then got a new soup and smashed my soup on the bowl full of rage. I didn't appreciate her rage going into my bowl. Then another couple came in and she did greet them and offered for in or to go at this point idk if it was inconsistency of customer service from her part and lacking customer service experience, hates her job so she needs to be reminded or just being plain B to other women!

Between my husband and I we have tried almost everything on the menu and it all has been delicious. Unfortunately the terrible service has lessened our dining experience every time. We have given this place the benefit of the doubt multiple times but I think we're finally just done. Expect to wait a very long time to be seated, to be served, and to be given your check. The waitresses frequently pay no mind to the guests once seated so hopefully your food is correct and you don't want a drink refill. They have lost a couple hundred dollars of mine by now by not picking up the phone for takeout on Friday and Saturday nights. They just let it ring endlessly . Today they were unable to seat us because despite multiple tables being open, they didn't have time to clear them. I frequently wonder if the manager/owner is aware of how much business is missed by his/her waitstaff; it's unreal.
