I thought I was being polite by even asking if we were cutting it too close, and the woman on the phone was rude enough to continue the conversation about me right in front of my face -- even after I gave them a 10 dollar tip on a 26.00 purchase (because even though I'm struggling financially, I try and take care of people in the industry as well -- especially if it's clear how much I'm inconveniencing their lives). I am not sure how I'm supposed to react when effective communication is lacking, but perhaps that should be worked on instead of passive-aggressive rudeness with attempts to embarrass a patron and make them feel uncomfortable. \nThe food and the coffee are great, but you're doing the industry a disservice by not delegating these jobs for the people who are struggling and would otherwise love to be there.", "date": "2020-12-29 20:04:57", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 1.0, "yelping_since": "2016-08-13 03:41:08"}}

It's upstairs is a fine coffee house which serves La Colombe and delectable pastries. but it also has a drop dead amazing selection of vinyl on the walls, and a mix of Waxpoetic Magazine and other such gems available to read. I think I'm swooning!\n\n The owner of the cafe used to be an owner of a well known record store on on second street (a damn huge street to the point that I'm not sure where yet and am looking forward to revealing on the update that will surely happen). And he fully intends to make his basement into a vinyl shop, which should be open next week! But in the mean time you can gaze at and purchase the stand out assortment of records that are on the on display on the wall. They also plan to start having concerts, and the first one is happening on the 16th.\n\nas far as the coffeehouse goes it offers self serve La Colombe, and some people might be happy to know that soy milk is free and located in it's big refrigerator. There's a fine assortment of danish (loved the cheese!), muffins, and bagels. And pretty soon they should be bringing in sandwiches. I also have to give it up the owner for being cool and accommodating. his mannerisms and catch phrases also had me comparing him to a cool radio DJ (think Wolfman Jack or Pierre Robert.). \n\nOverall Milkcrate is a cool coffeehouse in an area that really needed one (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rocket-cat-cafe-philadelphia#hrid:Q-IUXIqsYBU0U4vdigpZvg/src:self). and as soon as things like the vinyl shop run in full effect, it's destined to get a whole lot cooler!", "date": "2009-10-11 17:28:25", "useful": 9, "funny": 4, "cool": 7, "user": {"review_count": 1512, "average_stars": 4.17, "yelping_since": "2007-07-13 04:00:59"}}
