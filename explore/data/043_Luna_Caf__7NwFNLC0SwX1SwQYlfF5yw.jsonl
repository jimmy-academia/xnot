A little sweet with savory--ham and eggs on top with a perfectly baked cornbread and doused in some sort of sweet jam! Forget the hollandaise, this was inventive Benedict heaven. \n\nMy boyfriend had the Desayuno, a breakfast wrap filled with pulled pork, potatoes, eggs, and some sort of magic because it was so tasty, no sentence could justify its description.

Just as I was about to give up and get a breakfast sandy from Wawa, I noticed the little sidewalk sign for Luna Caf\u00e9. Though small and busy, I noticed a table leaving, so I decided to take the plunge.\n\nI was riding solo and dining-in (apparently take-out is a thing here). They asked if I wanted to sit at the bar in the back. I was shocked, given the size of the small front dining area, that Luna Caf\u00e9 had a bar, but hey? Why not? Well, to my surprise the bar what not remotely what I expected. It was small bar, more of a shelf really, lining a narrow passageway to an emergency exit/ cleaning closet. It was completely secluded and separate from the rest of the caf\u00e9, and I was the only one back there. I was a little confused, because when I walked in, there was a small table for two at the front. When I took my bar seat at the back, I almost felt like I was put there because I was ugly or something, hidden from the rest of the public. I'm used to dining alone, but I still enjoy the company of others. It was bizarre to be on the outside looking in, and I think the service staff nearly forgot me a handful of times.\n\nSpeaking of the service, it wasn't bad but it wasn't overly great either. I guess I was just a little salty about being sat, secluded by myself.\n\nI ordered the pancakes ($10) with chocolate chips ($2 up charge), and a side of bacon ($3). The bacon was very greasy, and I would have liked it a bit crispier. Everyone has different bacon opinions though. The pancakes were chock-full of chips (see what I did there). They weren't super fluffy, but I could tell they were hot and homemade. They definitely satiated my cravings, though I think the $12 price tag is a little on the high end.\n\nLuna Caf\u00e9 has a cute little set-up for a quick morning bite, and it's located in the heart of Old City, walking distance from great sights and shops. It's about 100 steps from the 2nd and Market stop on the Market-Frankford Line, so public transport is your best bet in getting here. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here again.

We placed our orders: a chicken wrap, a turkey wrap and a spicy chick pea burger - substituting fries for the salad with the burger. \n\nIt took a little longer than expected to be delivered - and when it was, it was with a \"plop\" on our table... one person in our party noticed that he did not have salad dressing (neither did I, but I will get to that in a minute).  He asked the waitress if he could have dressing, and she said it was already on his salad. He glanced at his salad and politely said that he didn't think there was. When he met the waitress' gaze again, she literally SNAPPED, \"Yes, it is! I can see it from here!\" \n\nDuring the exchange, I was wryly eyeing my salad - which by the way was lovely, but as barren as the Sahara when it came to dressing. I considered daring her to find the salad dressing on mine just to prove the point, but I demurred.  It didn't matter really since I had ordered fries as a substitute anyway. At this point I intervened in the Great Vinaigrette Debate that was playing out at the table with a request for the fries that I ordered. The waitress did apologize for that then asked if she should bring extra salad dressing to the table. Unfortunately, I was annoyed at this point and sharply replied \"Yes.\" \n\nWe began to eat our lunch and from the back of the cafe we could hear discussion about the fries. Apparently, it was a GREAT concern over who's \"fault\" it was that I did not receive fries... \n\nLuna Cafe...

I called the day before to move up my reservation by an hour, and they were very accommodating. One of my friends arrived early, and they seated him at a table way in the back. It was a little odd, because it was the only table down a long hallway past the kitchen. I guess it was nice to have our own area, but I would have preferred to be in the main dining area.\n\nThe menu was heavily focused on breakfast food. In hindsight, I think they actually might have given us the breakfast menus because the brunch menu online has a lot of sandwiches listed that were definitely not on our menus. I usually prefer lunch food at brunch, but I do like eggs benedict, so I went with that. Their \"Norwegian Eggs Jefferson\" is eggs benedict with salmon, and it was pretty good. What I did not like about the dish was the \"biscuits\" it was served on. The biscuits tasted like really crumbly dry cornbread...gross! Also, the eggs were overcooked so that the yolks were solid. I like runny yolks with my benedict, so I was disappointed. The salmon was very good but I was surprised that it came fully cooked. I expected lox because the salmon was described as house-cured on the menu, but it still tasted very good so no complaints there. It was served with a side of fresh fruit salad that included apples, grapefruit, and oranges. I was a big fan of the fruit salad, but unfortunately the hollandaise sauce from my benedict overflowed onto the fruit salad, so it all got mixed together. It still tasted ok, though. My friends were also happy with their meals but not overly impressed. It's a BYOB, so I brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate my move to NY. We drank it straight because it was decent quality, and I didn't want to dilute it with OJ, but you can order glasses or pitchers of orange juice if you want to make mimosas.\n\nThe service was a little slow, but I think that might have been because we were in that back area.

Usually while I'm walking my dog. Or with groceries in my hand. Or doing something similar that in no way screams \"HEY LOOKING TO HAVE A GOOD MEAL WHERE SHOULD I GO?!\" It's bad enough being harassed by the Big Bus Company folks and 5th and Market. And having to resist buying every adorable dog that's ever in the window at Doggie Style. If your restaurant is good, you will not need to request my presence. I'll be there. No invite necessary.\n\nSo to keep with the theme of this review, I will continue to provide my insight to you in list form (you're welcome). Here's what they're doing well.\n\n- D\u00e9cor - Love the homey, vintagey vibe with local artwork.\n- Staff - Incredibly welcoming. Incredibly helpful.\n- (Mostly) local sourcing, healthy, yet creative food options.\n- Free champagne during grand opening. They had me at free champagne.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement.\n\n- Paper napkins + uncovered tea lights = fire hazard. Glad I could demonstrate that to them early in their new adventure. I AM THE WORST. Luna Caf\u00e9, please once again accept my apologies for thinking that fanning a napkin on fire with my bill folder was a good idea.\n- Food execution (see next three bullet points).\n- Latke Luna - a little more salt/spice/flavor on the actual latkes. However, both dipping sauces were quite nice.\n- Fritto Misto - Menu said \"lightly fried,\" but it wasn't quite \"lightly\" enough. The fish they used was great and was overshadowed by too much breading.\n- Caprese Focaccia Panini - Wonderful flavors, but ours was cold in the middle. Sad face.\n\nDefinitely going to come back.

I would plan on taking a friend here the next time I come down this way, and I recommend you do, too.", "date": "2019-06-05 13:44:44", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 6, "average_stars": 4.25, "yelping_since": "2019-06-05 13:18:27"}}

I was craving huevo rancheros and doin his place thanks to Yelpers. Yes, it's small and you get to walk through the kitchen ( I adore that , I think it shows you have nothing to hide) to-get to the few back tables. Our server Rich was delightful and very informative. I had the winning dish although my husband thoroughly enjoyed his, he did agree. I had the huevo rancheros and it was just a flavor bomb. I did share as it was a large dish. He had the frittata with potatoes and it was good as well. I have to take off one star because the food was not hot at all when brought to the table. They were very busy so I kind of get it. Get it out hot folks and you are definitely a winner. My husband wants to go back tomorrow. I always like to try a new place.\n\nWell after having a mediocre experience prior to the Army Navy game yesterday, we returned this morning because we needed some great grub prior to the flight home. There was Rich , happy to help once again. Today we both got the Luna bowl with two eggs ( he got bacon) with the most delicious home fried potatoes with peppers and onions topped with a fresh pico de Gallo and hot sauce. We should have shared because it was huge! But oh so good!!  A lot of West Point cadets were going in as we left and I had to stop and tell them exactly what to order! Lol!  We didn't win the game, but it doesn't matter.

It is a small cafe and was almost full at this time, but we were lucky to be seated as party of 2 almost immediately. \n\nOur server arrived shortly and she was pleasant. We ordered coffee and orange juice for drinks. I ordered an omelette with tomatoes, red peppers and feta and my husband got one with avocado, turkey and feta. Both omelette got potatoes and multigrain toast on the side. We also got 3 mini pancakes. I especially asked my omelette to be well cooked but in the end, I was able to see the egg white and yellow sides pretty shiny and couldn't eat 1/3of it... Also I had a piece of avocado inside my omelet and my husband had none, but he had onions? Some mix and match going on in there... I am not a fan of pancakes, so I would say they were OK. They fill the coffee cups with a pot continuously which is a plus, but for me coffee was on the darker and strong brewed so I didn't drink much of even my first cup, but my husband enjoyed it.\n\nWhile we were leaving around 11am, it got very very crowded and the door almost opened every minute. I agree with a reviewer who mentioned the door staying open and getting cold. Absolutely true!!! We were close to the door and my feet got frozen literally. If you are a cold feet, don't go there or just find a place at the back.\n\nIt is cash only place, so either go prepared or there is an ATM at the back of the cafe. I found ~50$+ gratuity on the expensive side for a brunch (saying this as a NewYorker!) which is quite rushed. we had a 14.5$ for one of the omelettes and 13$for the other which both had no extra's (3ingredients only and priced as 13$ in the menu) we didn't make a fuss for 1.5$ but didn't understand why. \n\nOverall I give Luna 4 (a rolled over 3.5) It is a nice small cafe where the vibe is local and nice, the food is tasty but apparently they have very high traffic in the place and this affects the service quality and experience not very positively.", "date": "2019-02-24 16:53:30", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 119, "average_stars": 4.09, "yelping_since": "2015-12-26 03:55:47"}}

First we ordered 2 of the peanut butter & Nutella smoothies & asked the server how it was made because I wanted one without bananas in it. He said he didn't know how it was made because it's made in the kitchen (whatever that's supposed to mean because if you're a server these are basic things you should know) he also said there wasn't any peanut butter & when I asked the other server he said there wasn't any Nutella. So I was confused about what they had & ordered 2 berry smoothies if there wasn't any peanut butter or if they Couldn't take out the bananas & I asked if he could check with the kitchen first before anything & let us know & he made us pay for everything before we even tried any of what we ordered. We paid & tipped before any of our things came, while everyone else had the opportunity to pay once they were done their meal (there were 3 other tables in front of us that we watched this happen) We got our food & smoothies( we received one smoothie without any Nutella when I never asked for that ) didn't like the smoothies so we asked if they can just give us orange juice in exchange for one smoothie we didn't like, yet they still tried to charge us for one small $4 cup of orange juice. Our tabs total came up to $66 with the tip included & they couldn't give us a complimentary orange juice? I was about to pay for it with my card when my boyfriend tried to take my card because we were just going to leave a $5 bill for the orange juice. The server tried to snatch my card from his hand & I asked to speak to a manager & he insisted he was the manager. We said we weren't going to pay for the orange juice because that was terrible service as paying customers. He also said he was going to charge us for the orange juice anyways without our permission. I will never recommend this place if you are a person of color & I would never come back to this restaurant.", "date": "2020-08-30 18:40:35", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 2, "average_stars": 1.0, "yelping_since": "2018-07-19 17:24:12"}}

Luna seemed to be closest and one of the only places open this early.\n\nI ordered the brown sugar cardamom latte (one of the specials of the say; needed some caffeine after the super early bus ride) and the breakfast bowl -- which was quinoa with a lot of mix'ins. Now, I've had a lot of quinoa bowls, but this one was fantastically AMAZING and jam-packed with flavor. Portions were great for both the latte and the bowl. The latte came in a cute Luna Caf\u00e9 mug as well.\n\n***update***\n\nI wrote the previous part of this review as I was still eating, hence why it was initially 5 stars. Dropping it to 4 solely because of the service -- the food came out quickly and was good, but no waitstaff came by at all while I was eating, yet they checked on other tables frequently. Thought that was strange. A waiter ended up handing off the check to me, I suppose after I seemed to be looking around implying I wanted someone to come over. But all that happened without me being asked whether I wanted anything else or if I even wanted the check.

They were very busy and the wait for a table for one was about 15min, which isn't bad at all. This time I payed around and had my server make the choice for me, she was a little nervous but I was confident she couldn't mess it up. The hospitality was wonderful and everyone greeted me as they walked past. No one standing still and attending everyone consistently. \n\nThe waitresses choices were spot on, she did cheat a little by giving a sampling of biscuits and gravy (So Happy she did this!). The Breakfast Taco's are exceptionally well done, the chef that runs the kitchen knows exactly what their doing. Pico de Gallo was refreshing and not overly spicy, eggs scrambled to perfection, and the sauce poured over the taco's made them perfection! \n\nNow for the biscuit and gravy sampling, never have I ever had a biscuit like this before! Flaky and perfectly rounded out with a light buttery flavor, the layering makes me think it was made with Filo dough. The sausage gravy richly flavored and had no grit from the sausage. Perfectly seasoned and not overly peppered or salted, most make their gravy greasy and under seasoned, this will not disappoint! \n\nDo Not Miss this spot to have breakfast or brunch!

While we waited for someone to take our order, about two more crowds walked in and were politely greeted immediately and told them someone would be with them in one minute. Right after, another group walked in and after being greeted, they were advised to have a seat and would be asked to show their cards when someone came to the table.\n\nMy partner and I immediately noticed a large difference in customer care between us and the groups following us; I'm not one to say this often but it definitely felt like it was because we're are people of color.\nWe decided not to eat there and didn't even bother to try their food based on their service.
