It's located away from the more popular haunts on 10th street, but it's a great little establishment where you can grab a quick meal (they specialize in Taiwanese cuisine) or ruminate life over specialty teas or coffee.\n\nMy friend and I visited Ray's Caf\u00e9 on a rainy Saturday afternoon. They had just opened for the day, so the shop was pretty empty but we were greeted by the friendly staff and were quickly seated. Ray's doesn't have much in terms of decor, but what you're really there for is the food and drinks! On with it.\n\nWe started off with an order of Pork & Napa dumplings as well as our drinks. Now, reading some other Yelp reviews, I knew I had to try the \"Syphon\"-brewed coffee. It's pretty pricey (a cup runs $5-$10 depending on the coffee), but I thought I would splurge a bit since my trip to Philly was a vacation-of-sorts. \n\nNow, the Syphon-brewed coffee is only available for the specialty coffees that Ray's has featured, which are sourced from around the world. I opted for the Japanese charcoal-roasted coffee. Now, the fun part -- watching it brew from behind the counter in this contraption straight out of a mad scientist's library. It's pretty neat to watch the water bubble and the coffee infuse, and the end product was a smooth, silky cup of coffee. The Japanese roast was mild and not very acidic. It paired great with just a touch of cream and sugar. The coffee is also served with a little cookie!\n\nNow, the food. The aforementioned dumplings came in an order of eight, and they were juicy, hot, and delicious. I enjoyed the texture of the dumpling skin, which was a bit thicker than I'm used to, and the flavors of the filling. For my entr\u00e9e, I opted for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which was perfect for the brisk, gloomy day. There were plentiful noodles, beef, and veggies all submersed in a rich, flavorful broth. It was a very cost-friendly meal that left me plenty stuffed.\n\nOverall, Ray's colored me impressed and I definitely want to come back next time I'm in Philly. They have plenty more coffee options and Taiwanese food options left to try!\n\nSome Final Tips:\n- It's a small shop, so larger groups probably aren't the best, but tables can comfortably accommodate four people. \n- Brunch items are served on Saturdays!\n- Closed on Sundays!", "date": "2016-05-09 00:33:57", "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 160, "average_stars": 3.63, "yelping_since": "2013-05-23 22:07:51"}}

This review is based on a single experience, so it may have been an off-day.  I hope, anyway.  I believe this is a Taiwanese-owned/operated place.  If you came here for the coffee, you may be in the luck.  I'm not coffee connoisseur, but they did seem to have a huge variety of coffees and an extraordinary way of brewing some of them, using what looks like labratory equipment.  \n\nBut I didn't come here for the coffee, and the food was just okay.  Boyfriend and I both ordered off the lunch menu so it came with several components.  My order came with vegetarian hot and sour soup, coffee with a madeleine, and the main course.  The hot and sour soup and coffee were great, but the main lunch course was a complete misfire.  It was supposed to be walnuts with mushrooms/soy patties next to brown rice, and on the menu it indicated that it was a 'spicy' dish.  Instead, the dish was sickeningly sweet.  Even the walnuts were candied walnuts.  Almost inedible for a lunch course, and too odd to be a dessert course... the sauce it was in was like eating syrup.  \n\nI want to give this place a second chance.  The presentation is way better than your average Chinese joint, and the atmosphere (not the view from the window, though) feels just like a Taiwanese cafe.  \n\nI'll re-review when I get the chance to revisit.", "date": "2009-03-12 23:10:28", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 288, "average_stars": 3.23, "yelping_since": "2008-10-24 17:56:18"}}

Okay.\n\n I don't really care for the dumplings. Definitely not the house soup noodle. It's seriously boiling vegetables in water, then adding a random assortment of mushrooms, other veggies, egg, and meat. I feel like they take everything they left over from other dishes and boiled it with soft noodles. My favorite is the cold sesame noodle and tomato rice with chicken. Okay. \n\nService, however, is not okay. Understatement. It's terrifyingly horrible. \n\nI've been here 5 times and have always left generous tip because although the lady doesn't communicate with us much or is overly attentive, she seemed nice. I liked the atmosphere. So i did the job of a customer to express my appreciation. Every. Time.\n\nToday I went and ordered my food politely. But the boss decides to say these words to my face, before she even left with the order. \n\n\"This is dine in, so you know you have to leave 15-18% tip. This is your choice, if you don't want to leave tip you can order take out. Do you want to order take out? Because you've been here many times and you never leave tip. Last time you left a dime.\" and she left. \n\nHow in the world does she think she has the right to scold me? Incredible. I am so sure that I've always left more than the 18% tip she so grudgingly specified. The food isn't even that good, but I keep on returning because I thought it was a friendly place with a nice atmosphere. And I believe that tip is simply a way to express gratitude to good service, which is completely up to me, not her. Are those few dollars really worth losing a potential regular?

Sporting an elegant, cozy seating environment (something like Starbucks minus the couches) - they offer the best coffee I have ever had to date. (Much much better than those franchise coffee places) \n\nTheir coffee is bred to perfection as you literally taste every drop that goes through your mouth. When you are done, you feel so energized and satisfied that you will probably order another one. \n\nI had the Hawaiian (their top of their line coffee aka the \"King\" of coffee) served very elegantly in small tray which also comes with a delicious cookie. Wow, halfway through it my mind just lit up and I could not stop smiling. \n\nI also ordered a regular ice coffee which was very delicious, and ice coffee with vanilla ice cream which was just as great. But it is their hot coffee which shines the most. \n\nOne drawback is you will pay a price - it is very expensive. The Hawaiian cost 7 dollars for a mere cup. (literally, a cup) But, if you make this an occasional trip - it won't hurt you but only give you instant satisfaction.  Their ice coffee runs about 5 dollars and you won't get much either but to me it was worth the experience for a traveler. \n\nOne more thing I highly recommend as your are sipping their delicious coffee. Actually, two. First, I highly recommend you to try their Dumpling Sampler - which 5 different sets of delicious dumplings. I mean - these aren't your regular asian dumplings - they are made to literal perfection and when combined with their two different sauces - only pushes it beyond perfection.The Dumpling Sampler includes 2 Veggies(very very good), 2 fried curry chicken (very good and crispy), 2  chicken ( the most average ) , 2 pork with leek (very good), and one more which I forgot. They are also beautifully served in a traditional chinese dish, and a marvel because all come in different colors! \n\nAgain, you pay the price because it cost $7.50 for 10 dumplings. Second, try their smoothies! I had a mango smoothie and I was stunned that they also produce smoothies as good as their coffee!\n\nRemember to visit when in Philly! I'll add pictures of their food and storefront soon.\n\nP.S - They take credit cards on orders 15 dollars and over combined.

This is how Ray's feels to me. Few times have I visited while other people were there. I feel like its location amidst the sea of thousands of Chinese food restaurants in Chinatown has kept it a secret. \n\nI love coffee...and thought I was well-versed and somewhat of a connoisseur, yet I knew nothing of the siphon coffee they prepare at Ray's. They have a bunch of specialty blends (like the $8.50/cup Jamaican Blue Mt), and also a bunch of their own blends (like the \"Philadelphia\" and \"New York\" blends).  Each coffee on the menu highlights a different attribute in the bean/blend (acidity, smoothness...) so there is something for everyone! \n\nSo here's the process: A specific amount of the whole bean of the blend/bean of your choice is weighed out, then ground, and placed in what looks like a vacuum filter from a chemistry lab. A flask with water is then placed over a flame with the vacuum filter (containing the coffee) placed on top of it. When the water in the flask boils it travels up into the filter, mixing with the coffee. They stir with what looks like a paintbrush, and when the flame is turned off the now-brewed coffee travels back down into the flask! It's about a 5 minute affair, and what comes out is perfection. Served in a beautiful cup, with a tiny pail of heavy cream and delicious cookie, it is heaven. \n\nI'm not done yet! The food is friggin AWESOME! I ALWAYS order the shrimp curry rice noodles because it's sooo gooooood! I've eaten some of my friends tofu dishes they ordered and they were delish as well. It tastes so clean and simple, like you're getting a home cooked Taiwanese meal.  There's always a bunch of young guys working there and they just hang out, which makes me think they're a family. That is great :' ) \n\nYou can buy the coffee beans there too, and I would insanely recommend buying the Ray's House blend. It is easily one of the most delicious coffees. It is extremely fragrant but delicate, and has good hints of caramel and hazelnut.  Seriously amazing, I would actually prefer their blend to the Jamaican Blue Mountain! I WORK in a coffee place and am heading there tomorrow to buy a bag-o-beans! \n\nCheck it out, but PLEASE don't make it a trendy hipster hot spot.

The coffee wasn't spectacular but it was good and really cool to watch it be made. For $8-$12 for siphon coffee, you're paying for that experience. Dirty chai was good. Both came with small pastries which were nice and all presented well. I wish they had better pastry options, or just more. It's a coffee and tea shop, something sweet to eat with those would be great. What they did have (cake slices) looked like it had been sitting there for days. We were overall enjoying the concept and thought it was such a neat place until...\nThe experience:\nThe shop is very small and there were two workers there with very soft music playing so we could hear everything they were saying and also felt like we couldn't talk about the drinks or they'd hear everything we were saying. We got our drinks and they started chatting with each other. The male was irate at a bad yelp review they had gotten because of their bathrooms. Awkward to be customers listening to the workers complaining about a yelp review but it was so much worse than that. He was so pissed about this guy and kept going on and on for the entirety of our stay there. He said some things that were pretty obscene. I won't go into detail because I'm not trying to make someone lose their job (also waited quit a while to post about it). We thought this would be a neat place to take people who are visiting but after that experience, we will not be back.", "date": "2020-02-28 23:39:39", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 17, "average_stars": 4.06, "yelping_since": "2020-02-28 23:22:28"}}

(Warning: love letter ahead)\n\nIt's a cozy space so when we went for breakfast on a Saturday morning all the tables were taken - we were prepared to wait, but they cleared off a table just so we could sit right away!! (At this point, my heart was already full.)\n\nI had never had siphon coffee before, so the owner's son (we never got his name but with my creepy detective skills, I think his name is Lawrence) told us all about how the process works while we watched him brew it right in front of us (it looks like a chemistry experiment!). I got the sumiyaki and my friend got the Jamaican blue coffee and Lawrence gave us the extras from both so that we could try each other's. Looking at the coffee, you can tell it's going to be the smoothest coffee you've ever had. I'm not even a regular coffee drinker, and when I do I usually have a latte, but I was able to drink the siphon coffee black (probably because it was also accompanied by a cute little chocolate-dipped shortbread cookie that is from the same Greek place they've been getting them from for the last 30 years). It's pricey but well worth it!\n\nWe also ordered the beef tomato rice which was like tomato egg rice (the ultimate classic Chinese comfort food) with corn/peas/carrots, beef, and ketchup. So so cozy. We also got the popular dumpling sampler; they were all plump and juicy and everything I wanted.\n\nThere was delicious homemade chili oil as well, which is a labor of love by Lawrence's brother who grinds the peppers himself and has to arm himself with goggles/gloves when he makes it. You can take some home for about $4 a container - do it and thank me later.\n\nMy friend and I were enjoying our morning slowly so by the end of the meal we had talked to Lawrence quite a bit. After we got the check he even gave us a slice of the cheesecake (I LOVE cheesecake so to say I was excited is an understatement) which was accompanied by coffee jelly and espresso beans. The cheesecake was smooth, creamy, and not too sweet. It was made by his brother who came up with a recipe from lots of Youtube research and taste testing by a friend who is also a cheesecake aficionado. \n\nThe hospitality I experienced here reminded me of why I love Philly so much, and you can see how much pride the Ray family has in their cafe and how much care and intentionality was involved in the food/drinks from beginning to end (even in selecting the dishes/utensils). I hope it stays around for many many more years to come, and next time I'm in town it'll be my first stop!", "date": "2021-07-11 03:23:52", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 431, "average_stars": 4.54, "yelping_since": "2017-08-15 18:47:56"}}
