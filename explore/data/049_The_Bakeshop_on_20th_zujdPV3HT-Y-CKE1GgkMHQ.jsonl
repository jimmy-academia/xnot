Looks like something out of a movie, super cute and old-timey.  Stereotypically hipster, if that makes sense.  I was greeted by one of the best selections of overflowing multicolored sweets poised in glass that I ever laid my eyes on.  I'm a visual learner, so if I can't SEE what I'm buying, I probably ain't gonna buy it (why TF do so many other bakeries not display all their shit?).\n\nAnyway, I also heard from a coworker that their breakfast sandwiches were dope, so I ordered to-go a turkey bacon/egg/cheddar on a bagel (\"Philly Muffin\") and a nice selection of 6 different carefully-chosen pastries (so hard to not just say, \"I'll take the lot!\").\n\nThe wait for my sandwich took longer than expected, but they were definitely busy with both in-house customers and Postmates/Caviar orders during the morning rush.  I was able to get a better look at all the different varieties of non-bakery foods they offered, as well as what looked to be really great, locally-sourced coffee.\n\nFor my sandwich and sweets it came close to $40 (yikes), but I would estimate that each pastry was probably like $4-5 each (they're MASSIVE), so makes sense, especially when I went in there no-holds barred on the budget.\n\nOverall, my sandwich was okay (I was a little underwhelmed actually).  The Philly Bagel (essentially a square English muffin, but seasoned like an everything bagel) would have been better on its own with just butter (it was too soft and I like a bit of a bite to my sandwiches, like an actual bagel or a kaiser roll).  The egg was cooked fine, but the turkey bacon was not crispy at all and too thick-cut.  Next time, I'd stick to something a little more classic.\n\nAs for those pastries, the bike ride to work then back home that night jostled TF outta them, so a few fell apart.  My absolute favorite was their ricotta/Italian wedding cookie. My mom and I have made these every year for Christmas since my birth and they've never come out that good - absolutely perfect.  Will probably go back and just get like a dozen of those.  Others were 2 cinnamon/raisin cookies, a tahini chocolate chip cookie, a strawberry oat bar, and a birthday cake blondie.  The blondie was my second favorite, but very very sweet.  The oat bar and cinnamon cookie were too floury, almost like a biscuit.

We each got a breakfast sandwich and a cold brew - he got a bacon egg and cheese on an everything philly muffin, and I got smoked salmon avocado toast on an everything philly muffin - which we ate at a table outside and both were fresh and delicious. Their \"serve yourself\" cold-brew was great, and I liked not having to explain to somebody how full I wanted my cup. That brings us to the sweet treats. They were sampling a cherry \"pop tart\" which was fantastic. I normally hate cooked cherries because they stop tasting like real cherries but this was lovely, not too sweet and still tasted like real fruit. We then got a Maple Oat scone, a chocolate chip cookie, something with apricot (bar maybe), and one other thing that I cant remember to go. When we got to my grandmothers and sat down for some sweets and tea every single item was delicious. The scone was traditional but not too dry, the apricot was a total winner - we were all fighting over the last bits, and the cookie while a touch too sweet had tons of chocolate and great consistency. I will say that we noticed that they had forgotten 1 of the item we ordered but we didn't check our order before leaving and also ordered in a such a scattered way that I can't really fault them for it.

They also offer fruit babka, but our eyes were set on the chocolate and I feel that we made the best decision :) It was so flaky yet dense (but not too dense) and chock full of melty chocolate. Truly a wonderful treat! The babka is quite filling since it is a bit dense, so highly recommend splitting it with a friend. We couldn't limit ourselves to just this treat though, so we snagged a chocolate chip cookie ($1 with Yelp check in!) and homemade pop tart (!) to go.

Never. The closest I came to was walking 16 blocks to Payard Patisserie, when Monsieur Payard still had his UES location. Other than that, they've all been long subway rides. I suppose I should be thankful as who knows what my LDL would have been otherwise! \n\nSo, a couple of years back, while working on a project in Philly, imagine my surprise and delight to find this delightful and unassuming bakery  just a few minutes' walk from me.  I'd be here for breakfast, lunch... and cookie break - and wonder why people were lining outside nearby Carlo Bakery instead of making their way here. \n\nThe Bakeshop had/has everything: freshly made sandwiches using top notch and fresh ingredients on great English muffins (a truly magnificent Avocado Toast Special), innovative items like the Rittenhouse Square (caramel covered brownie on a somewhat salty graham cracker base) and Brookie (brownie + cookie), and regular bakery goods that were/are better executed here than at most places (scones that weren't dry or crumbly, chocolate babkas, gluten-free chocolate cookies). In those days, the amazing baker Meg (of Nutmeg Cake Design) would share the kitchen and one could hope to run across fresh cupcakes baked from ingredients remaining from the wedding she'd catered to. That would be the special treat ... on top of all the other sweet treats!\n\nSadly, as I moved away, I could no longer be a regular here. I still go back and sample what's available infrequently, and while I can understand the complaints about limited seating capacity and the $5 minimum credit card charge, and I'm not a fan of the (few) retail items that are not made in-house, I'd say that the Bakeshop is likely still the best bakery in the neighborhood.", "date": "2017-07-31 22:28:40", "useful": 9, "funny": 5, "cool": 7, "user": {"review_count": 644, "average_stars": 3.62, "yelping_since": "2006-11-05 01:05:25"}}

Bakeshop on 20th has HANDS. DOWN. The BEST chocolate chip cookie I have EVER had. It's huge, filled with chocolate chips. It's sweet with a slightly crunchy exterior and soft, chewy interior. It's not crumbly or over/under-baked. I'm honestly unsure how such a perfect cookie could even exist. It's fairly rich and could easily be shared amongst two people if you're feeling generous. I had no problem polishing the entire thing before my breakfast even arrived at my table. I couldn't even manage to get a decent picture of the cookie (not that a photo would do any justice anyways) because I could not control myself from biting into it from the second it hit my hands. Additionally, check-in with Yelp and get the cookie for ONE DOLLAR, which frankly feels like robbery because it's just THAT good. \n\nI ordered the Salmon Special for $12. It was advertised as an English muffin, topped with fresh sliced salmon, cream cheese, capers, tomato, and onion. In my head, I pictured on of those small, store-bought English muffins. Uhm. No. It was a huge, whole-wheat, house made wonder packed high with tons of salmon. It was a heaping, delicious sandwich. I honestly could have taken half home for later, but again with the no self-control. I ate the whole thing and was full for the remainder of the day. \n\nIf you'd blink, you'd miss this little shop. It's it a super cute area just west of Rittenhouse Square Park. They've got a fresh selection of cookies, scones, and other goodies baked in-house on display in a glass case. I'd imagine it'd be impossible to make a wrong choice here. Everything is delicious tasting and easy on the eyes. You can tell it's made with fresh ingredients and lots of love.\n\nThe inside of the shop is small and can easily feel claustrophobic. There's a handful of stools and a couple of tables, but realistically, the entire shop is only equipped to comfortably seat about 6-7 patrons. I felt in the way as I waited for my sandwich. I ordered my sandwich to-go, but it took about 15 minutes to be ready. Fortunately, I grabbed a free seat and perused some of their hilarious pug-themed novelty books. I'm sure the sandwich was freshly made, but I had no idea it'd take fifteen minutes. There were several patrons who came in after me, and I guess it just took longer than I'd expected. I'm just glad I wasn't in a hurry. \n\nNeedless to say, I'll definitely be back next time I need a cookie fix. Come! Check in! Get a cookie! The food is great!", "date": "2018-02-27 20:06:07", "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 453, "average_stars": 4.34, "yelping_since": "2015-07-18 16:06:23"}}
