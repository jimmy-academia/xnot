I will come back and post about those when I do.\n\nMy only complaints are two... if you are gonna serve in real cups for consuming on premises I would prefer a cup that isn't all chipped and cracked.

Despite my many trips to Firehouse Bikes (upstairs) and Dock street (next door), I never stopped in for coffee.  Perhaps because I don't really hang out in coffee shops - I'm the type of person who gets work done in a library.  But I was feeling the need to chill and get some work done on Memorial Day, so I hopped on my bike and went right over.\n\nThe inside is a little too bohemian for my tastes.  It's kind of dark and kind of cluttered, but homey - like your hippie grandmother Ethel passed it on down to her peace-punk kiddos to do as they liked with it.  I like sun and fresh air, so I sat outside.  \n\nThe girl working the counter was friendly and got me my drink fast and the banter outside was nice.  Casual, but interesting (yeah, I judge a cafe by the eavesdropping I can do there).  Combined with the traffic on Baltimore ave., the kids playing in the park across the street, and the birds chirping (I love spring!) I had the perfect grant-writing soundtrack.  My iPod stayed in my bag the whole time, but as far as music is concerned, I did hear the Arctic Monkeys coming through the stereo at one point.  I'm not sure if it was from Firehouse or Satellite, though.\n\nBut here's what seals the deal:  I'm sitting in the shade, writing this on a wi-fi connection called \"Drink More Coffee!\" while looking at a beautiful garden and feeling the breeze drift by.

There's a soundtrack present, which kind of hits me as a low hum of punk, and which I kind of tune out after a while.\n\nSo coffee, yes this is why I came in the first place wasn't it?  It's quite tasty, and in several varieties in different pour your own carafes. I can't speak for the quality of other various espresso/coffee/milk/foam etc. combinations, since I tend to just order coffee at whichever cafe I happen to visit.\n\nOn to food, the barista recommended the bike shop special bagel.  Well it just about knocked my socks off and was certainly one of the better bagel and topping combinations I've had.  Although I've not had some of the more elaborate cakes, the cookies are rather tasty as well.   \n\nNow having read some of the other reviews I would like to make one thing clear.  The vibe at the Satellite is not really of the hipster variety.  There are punks yes, and there are punks of varying crusty varieties.  There are most certainly people who appear to have hippy leanings.  I cannot however say that I have seen many hipsters.  If you enjoy going on safari and spotting hipsters in their natural habitat, I suggest paying a visit to nearly any establishment that serves coffee in Fishtown, where they thrive in abundance. \n\nThe service was quite alright, and I would go so far as to say that I really didn't pick on an \"I'm cooler than you because I'm on the other end of a counter in an independently owned cafe\" vibe.", "date": "2012-03-04 05:35:31", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 11, "average_stars": 3.5, "yelping_since": "2009-11-23 23:03:42"}}

The issue is freshness.  Who knows how long the teas have been sitting there?  They have a huge selection and turnover is low.  I've ordered tea here and, even for types of tea that tend to keep a long time, like black tea, it doesn't tend to taste very fresh.\n\nThere is also an issue with freshness of baked goods.  I ordered a cookie here once and it had a printed date of about a week ago, on the cookie.  Contrast this with other places, even in the neighborhood, where you can buy baked goods.  Four Worlds bakery sells stuff baked in the morning, and you can taste the difference in freshness.  I even think that other cafes, like Green Line and Metropolitan tend to stock consistently fresher baked goods.  I notice that both Green Line and Metropolitan mark down their old baked goods to half price, so that they quickly clear out.  Satellite doesn't (at least as far as I know) and instead it keeps a big stock of stuff, and then it isn't fresh.\n\nI really would like to see Satellite ramp up the freshness of the baked goods and the tea.  Seriously, CLEAR OUT THE WHOLE FREAKING STOCK OF TEA AND THROW IT OUT.\n\nAnd pare down your selection--including both tea and baked goods.  Like, stock only a few types of each, whatever ones are the best sellers, and stock them in a small enough quantity that they sell out.  With baked goods, ideally, get them in fresh every day or every other day and quickly mark down the day-old ones that don't sell.  With tea, the margin of error is much longer, but ideally, plan on restocking each tea every 3 months or so.  And store the tea in metal tins, not glass jars--the light makes it spoil much faster.\n\nThen, as you build a reputation for top-notch, fresh tea and baked goods, start working up to build a selection as you're building up the volume of sales.  That's how I'd run this (or any) business, and I think it would really ramp it up, probably to a five star establishment.\n\nI just can't in good faith give more than 2 stars when I've had such non-fresh stuff here.", "date": "2014-01-02 22:05:41", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 629, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2007-05-03 21:52:54"}}

I've been starting out with writing only reviews for the places that I think are stand-out the best in Philadelphia, and let me say, Satellite Cafe is definitely at the top of that list for me.\n\nI could hang around in this place for hours. The ambiance is unpretentious, off-beat, and sort of punky, with punk and/or indie music generally playing (I just LOVE the music selection). There is a little place for outdoor seating that has a little garden. Just outside the door, there is a big tack board for fliers and such. BIG TIP: if you are looking for basement shows in west philly, this tack board is a good place to find some. The interior is relatively small but deceptively spacious. It has a lot of art and graffiti on the walls, with string lights hanging around the window. If you go in the back, there are shelves of books to read and board games to play, and of course wi-fi. \n\nWith regards to the actual comestibles, this place is exactly what I love: yummy and cheap. I'm sure other people here have mentioned the bike shop special (so named because there is a bike shop on the second floor of the establishment): a bagel with cream cheese, pesto, red peppers, and spinach for only 2.50! Their other more substantial sandwiches (burritos, wraps, etc) are a bit more, but there's nothing on the menu that is more than, like, 6 dollars and everything is super delicious. Oh and have I mentioned the peanut butter bomb brownies? Wowie zowie! They're vegan and out of this universe. I'm pretty sure they don't make them in house, but the fact that they stock them is a major lure for me. Like any cafe, they have a full coffee selection, but what they do really special is their tea. They have a really extensive tea selection--both regular and herbal--that I am just nuts about (right now my faves are Versailles Earl Grey, the Rose Chai, and the Vital Tonic #5). \n\nThe only teeny tiny problem I can even think of is that the most recent time I went there (and I go there pretty regularly) they skimped a bit on the cheese on my partner's quesadilla.", "date": "2013-06-06 12:30:15", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 7, "average_stars": 4.38, "yelping_since": "2013-05-29 06:33:06"}}

This place really shows how vegan cooking ups the bar for all of us.  They have so many possible options for bagels you could go for a week without trying them all-- pesto, different kinds of butter/cream cheese, ajvar (spicy red pepper paste), all sorts of veggies.  This stuff really ruins you for any other place that just has plain ol' bagels and cream cheese.  \n\nI nominate their Bike Shop Bagel (loaded w/ cream cheese [vegan if you want it], baby spinach, roasted red peppers, and pesto) for one of the best deals in town at $2.25 (50 cents more for vegan).

When a dude in there told me that he wasn't a \"lost and found kind of guy\" and that if he found my hat somewhere I wouldn't see it again. I felt right at home.\n\nI went in because I curious as to whether I could find some of THAT CARROT CAKE, but nope... none to be found. They say he's off the menu for a little while. Oh well. I tried an italian soda and chose lime. What was I thinking? I should've gotten something a lot less mainstream... an untapped flavor full of potential completely free of pretense perhaps. It was tart like a mofo! I wasn't sure what to expect and I didn't want to add sugar water... but I had to. And from there it was pretty cool... but pretty expensive considering I just made my own Sprite. \n\nThe desserts looked interesting, but alas they weren't THAT CARROT CAKE. I came back later that day to Cedar Park and missed the CARROT CAKE MAN by a few minutes. All I saw was an empty tray and a cowboy hat. What a day. I was really tempted to get a Pumpkin Whoopie Pie/Cake in the shop... but I froze up. Maybe next time.\n\nIt took quite some time for me to realize that this place was even here.

Because it takes so long to get even a simple bagel or sandwich, my friend mistakenly grabbed someone else's order (since none of them were labeled). When I went up to get mine, the self-righteous 20-something girl at the counter was bitching to another customer about my friend, dropping f-bombs and all.

I went for the first time about a month ago and pulled a triple header (three days in a row) of ordering the Bike Shop Bagel and a large mug (hand-formed if i was lucky!) of loose-leaf tea and sitting there for more than 4 hours at a time getting caught up on work and enjoying the atmosphere. \n\nI love the kind of caf\u00e9 i can sit in for HOURS and be perfectly content just admiring the things they've got hanging (or painted) on the walls and ceilings and being delighted by the people I see walk through the door and sit for a spell. The ambience of the place garners five stars.-- very warm, welcoming, and spacious enough to make every visit a new experience depending on where you sit and what perspective of the place you take.\n\nSuper props for the hand-mosaicked tables, pochoir stencils on the walls, eccentrically skillful menu board illustrations (I can't wait to see what'll replace the witches stirring a cauldron for the winter...), ample supply of board games and books, varying types of seats (couches, chairs, high stools, regular old tables for two and four).\n\nThe tea menu also is quite good. However, at least three teas that I've attempted to order have been \"out\". This leads me to wonder how often these teas are actually replaced... I really want to try a few that sound delicious, but they never seem to be stocked.\n\nFinally, ONE negative point: I once bought a day-old muffin that tasted like reconstituted dog food. Since it was day-old, there was no label, so it might have catered to a certain dietary persuasion, but it was plain old bad. I threw it in my trash can at home and later found that my cat (who eats eeeeverything) had dragged the thing out onto the floor, hungrily ripped it apart, and ultimately poo-pooed it (meaning: left it lying on the floor, not \"poo-pooed\" in the literal sense...).\n\nActually, one more negative point: customer service does leave a little to be desired, depending on who's behind the counter. One night around 5pm I went in and ordered a Bike Shop Bagel, only to be sarcastically belittled as such (somewhat hyperbolically paraphrased): \n\n\"PSSHHHH BAGEL? Are you SERIOUS?! We ALWAYS run out of bagels. DUH. No one in their right mind tries to order a bagel after 4pm !!! What a LOSER! Have you even BEEN here before ?!\" \n\nNeedless to say, I was not thrilled, especially seeing as I had often ordered a Bike Shop Bagel after 5pm in the past, but I did consequentially realize that the Bike Shop Wrap (which I ended up ordering, when I should have just thrown my hot tea in the barista's face and stormed out) is also really good and gives you almost twice the innards as the bagel for only a buck more.\n\nDespite sometimes crappy customer service, the space itself --and its menu selections-- is wonderful, so I give the place five stars with the suggestion to make Satellite part of your repertoire... because maybe then the counter people won't be so sour/apathetic to you in the future :) !!\n\nSECRET TIP: Bike Shop Bagel on a Cinnamon Raisin is GO-O-OD! ! !

We were originally lured in by the decor, a prettily lit cove crowded in by much bigger businesses.  Unlike a lot of people, it seems, I found the indoor atmosphere really relaxing -- soft lighting and plenty of tables and chairs, with wood furnishing and quirky decoration.  The staff were friendly without being overbearing, and were happy to answer my questions.\n\nI got a chai tea latte with almond milk, and was pleasantly surprised when it was brewed rather than made with a mixture.  The result was a much more earthy, spiced tea, hardly sweet at all.  My friend got a mate latte with almond milk, and she liked her drink as well.  We split one of the (vegan!) chocolate mint brownies, and it was heavenly -- I had to ask the girl at the counter if they really were vegan.  I have yet to try their coffee, but it is probably good too.\n\nThey have outdoor seating too, a small area with picnic tables and fairy lights strung along the staircase that leads to the bike repair shop.  If that doesn't cement this place as a hipster paradise, I don't know what does.\n\nDownsides (if you see them as such):\n-This place is cash only.  There is a PFCU right near the cafe, and there are ATMs all around.\n-They do have a cat, a sassy little thing named Lina.  She keeps away from the food and beverages, mostly hanging out by the exit, but if that sort of thing skeeves you out, you might want to not go or take some Benadryl with you.\n\nI would recommend this place.
