I eat that straight out of the bag, and I also made double chocolate bread pudding with the stale bits, and it was soooo good. \n\nPastries and others: \n\nTheir twice baked almond croissants are also divine. I have also tried this other pastry that I don't remember the name and it was also good, even the half I had left over and ate the next day! The fig bar was also good - shortbread type pastry on the outside is crumbly and buttery, like a perfect pie crust texture. It's especially good if they warm it a little for you. Cream cheese danish also delicious, and not too sweet. My dog also enjoyed the little dog bone biscuit they sell there. \n\nService:\n\nThe servers are also always friendly, even when busy, and when I ask them to slice up only half my loaf of bread, they don't give me weird looks or judge me.

Sometimes there's a bit too much egg glaze, but most often the problem is just too much butter (or that it's too unevenly rolled).  Some people might think that's a nice sign of artisanal or hand production.  I don't.  Nothing spoils a croissant like biting into a pool of butter.  The texture is bad, the taste is bad, and it makes you think the decadent treat wasn't worth it.  This has happened several times with croissants from Metropolitan.  More than is reasonable, in fact, for me to keep returning.  The first time I thought, well anyone could make a bad croissant out of thousands.  The second and third times I thought, well that's not right, but it was so close and convenient and the store seemed so well put-together I went again because I thought it had to be me -- it couldn't be this great upscale bakery's problem, could it?

The guy behind the counter was very nice as I figured out what I wanted to order. I went with a chocolate croissant and a slice of lemon pound cake for later, and a small coffee. The manager (owner?) said hello and made sure everyone was taken care of, which was nice. Unfortunately this place recommends (aka requires) a $10 min for card purchases. Thank goodness I had cash on me. $10? Really? Especially since my haul came to less than $7. Moving on. I got back to the hotel ready to dig into the croissant, but when I took it out I could immediately tell this was not going to go well. The crust wasn't flakey, the butter most definitely didn't come through, it was almost hard, and the chocolate bars were cold! Now, I have a place back home that sells chocolate croissants and makes them the way she learned in France as a pastry chef for the chateau at Versailles, so I know what it's supposed to taste like and that ain't it. Not by a long shot. Highly disappointing. I didn't even come close to finishing it. Maybe the lemon pound cake will redeem it and if so I'll edit, but if you're looking for a bakery with fresh and flaky pastries, look elsewhere.

I stopped in since I live a few blocks away, but was pretty disappointed with what I saw. \n\nI love baked goods and am a highly experienced baker myself, including breads of all kinds. But, even though I baked yeasted breads a couple of times a week, I do love a good bakery, because there's usually something that a bakery has that I've never made, can't make, don't feel like making at the moment, etc.\n\nSince Metropolitan Bakery seems like one of the best in the area, I was eager to see what they had. Nothing, of course, looked bad. But, nothing looks exceptional, and the prices are not really worth what they offer. I understand that expensive ingredients cost a lot of money and will raise the cost of baking on a small scale, but the products here are just mediocre.\n\nConsidering the alternatives are pretty dismal, I guess people are just ecstatic to have *something* else in Rittenhouse Square that offers breads and other baked goods.However, Metropolitan Bakery is mostly just \"meh.\"\n\nPhiladelphia is sadly not a city that values exquisite bakery items. Sure, you can get a good donut from the Amish at Reading Terminal Market, or a good canele from Market Day Canele. But, Philadelphia is not teeming with exceptional bread bakers, cake makers, or other baking specialists like some U.S. cities have like New York, San Francisco, or Chicago. \n\nIf Metropolitan Bakery is one of the best things that Rittenhouse Square has for the time being, it will obviously be much more time to come before the economy of Center City and Rittenhouse Sq, in particular, expand to the point that its residents will be able to find an amazing loaf of bread, the perfect croissant, or a host of other baked things that make life worth living.", "date": "2014-02-25 05:26:14", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 207, "average_stars": 3.38, "yelping_since": "2013-04-06 17:32:49"}}

The last three times I have visited, they have been all out of pastries, even mid way through the day. Dude, if it's selling out, bake more! Not just a one-off, they're systematically not making enough. French bakery without pastry -- what's the point?\n\n2. In the take-out part of the bakery, espresso-based coffee tastes great but the process could be better. It takes AGES, and then instead of putting a lid on it (being a take-out place, y'know), you have to scrabble around on the bottom shelf on the other side of a crowded shop. So easy to fix.\n\n3. Stop begging me for cash like a whiny child. You're a professional business, act like it. Take my card. Your prices are high enough to eat the card fee.\n\nTLDR: I really wanted to love this place as my neighborhood bakery. But their sloppiness irritates me too much; I won't be a regular.", "date": "2013-05-13 18:31:09", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 14, "average_stars": 3.5, "yelping_since": "2011-11-29 23:15:40"}}

Metropolitan bakery has confirmed that their Spelt Loaf is NOT gluten free. While this was a serious labeling error on the part of Metropolitan Bakery, they did work as quickly as possible to respond to me and to rectify the situation (e.g., changing their labeling, calling the markets selling their spelt loaf to make sure they know it's not gluten free, and also providing me with gift certificates for my family and friends who can eat their bread).  These actions speak well of their customer service.\n\nMetropolitan Bakery is currently labeling their Spelt Loaf as \"gluten free\".  Please be advised, this is likely incorrect information.  I called the company as of 1:15 PM today, and they are in the process of checking whether the loaf is indeed gluten free.  I advised they pull all gluten free labeling from their spelt loaves until they can determine what is happening, but I am not sure they have done that.  Until it is confirmed, I would advise shoppers to treat their spelt loaf as containing gluten and therefore not safe for anyone with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.", "date": "2012-08-20 17:31:08", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 11, "average_stars": 4.27, "yelping_since": "2012-08-20 17:30:31"}}
