We walked around a full hour more, and after 11pm restaurants were definitely done.  Sulking and annoyed with each other, we headed back to our hotel with empty bellies.  We decided to walk up a street that we hadn't yet been on, and came across Tria.\n\nA server was bringing food out to the one outdoor table, and I was so hungry and cranky I think I just blurted out to my husband as I grabbed his arm \"this is a cheese restaurant and they are still serving and we are eating here!\"  Later we couldn't actually figure out what made me call it a cheese restaurant - they must just do a good job of conveying what they're all about.  We walked in and they were indeed still serving, and thank god there were exactly two seats remaining at their bar (still a half-hour wait for a table, despite being after 11pm).\n\nSo I already felt a love for this place because I was so hungry and I was ever thankful that I could get a decent plate of food at 11:30 at night.  But beyond this simple appreciation, everything was great.  Cured meats + salty cheeses + great  wine + shortbread cookies = yum.  This kind of meal is just my thing, and perfect for a late night nosh.\n\nAnd the service kicked ass - god it made me wish that the local tapas place in my hometown could trade staff with Tria!  We were greeted enthusiastically at the door and put on the wait list.  We stood at the only empty space at the bar for a few moments and someone nearly instantly appeared with bar stools for us.  Menus and waters came quickly, and we placed our drink orders.  I got my wine right away, and in what only seemed like a few minutes later, my husband got his coffee and was informed that it was on the house because it took so long.  Just as I was about to get up to inform the host that she could take us off the wait list because we were comfy at the bar, she came up to us to ask if we still would like a table.  Even though the place was beyond packed, food came out fast and the bartender was perfectly attentive.  Everyone was just totally in synch and the service was seemless.  \n\nIt's funny how sometimes it's easy to not notice when everything clicks - things that go wrong stand out so much more.  But this was one of those meals that at the end of the night you realize it was excellent in its subtle delivery of everything you wanted.  Tria saved my belly from being angry and my husband and I from having a huge fight.  Instead we had a delicious meal and a great night, and yet another restaurant on our must-visit list for when we're in the Philadelphia area.", "date": "2009-05-21 00:52:12", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 98, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2009-01-09 13:18:51"}}

We are reservation people, so were disappointed that they did not have reservations (like many places in Philadelphia(not quite sure why?), but we thought not many people would be eating around 4pm, boy were we wrong.  The place was packed (which it was every time we had walked by during our stay).  Which is great for them, and must be a sign of it's popularity.  We somehow got a seat inside by a window, which was lovely.  The lady that sat us was very friendly and gave us the run down, since it was our first time there.  Our waitress came over to us and really was not pleasant.  I am ALWAYS friendly to everyone that works in a restaurant/bar, so her not being pleasant is really uncalled for, but perhaps that is just her personality.  We were very thirsty from walking around the last two days, so we ordered a glass of wine each and asked for water.  It took her about 15 minutes to bring us water, but our wine came out within 4 minutes (brought by someone else).  She just seemed annoyed.  \nThe menu items were all tantalizing and the plates we ordered were very good.  Another server walked by us and asked if we needed anything, with a friendly smile and we politely declined, but as she walked away, we wished it were her we had.  \nBetween my husband and I we ordered the Salmon salad, the chicken salad, the lamb sausage and a goat and a blue cheese.  We had wanted to order more wine, but decided to leave and have wine elsewhere, perhaps where the mood was slightly less, umm, how do I put this?...snobby?  \nWe ended up walking around the corner to our AMAZING hotel the Kimpton's Palomar, to regroup and then walked around Rittenhouse some more (eventually ending up at Marathon, which was way, way better and more inviting than Tria), in both of our opinions.  \n\nAs we sat by the food expediting station(literally right beside that and the bathrooms), we noticed that food/orders just sat there for a while!  We were actually kind of surprised by the length of ready orders just sitting out.  But the two guys preparing the plates, slicing cheese/cooking were outstanding in their productivity and execution.    \n\nThe best part of our meal was the lamb sausage.  The wine was good as well, but very/overly pricey.  \n\n\nWhen we return to Philly, we will most likely skip this spot, but perhaps it is better for locals, or just one of those trendy places that can get away with certain things.", "date": "2013-09-08 17:00:24", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 271, "average_stars": 3.82, "yelping_since": "2013-03-25 17:12:25"}}

It was the first time for both of us. We ordered wine and split some \"snacks\" to start. I would have liked go see more variety with the ingredients across the menu, but the taste was excellent. My favorite was the Warm Poached Black Mission Figs with Gorgonzola and Prosciutto di Parma.  I highly recommend it. I was impressed by the wine list as well. I started with the Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re \"Armador\". It was a delicious semi-dry red with nice hints of various flavors and spices. I followed up with the Zinfandel \"Mother Clone\". I expected it to be a bit more fruity based on the description. For dessert I had the Valrhona Chocolate Espresso Cake with Hazelnuts and Honey Mascarpone. Think less cake-like, more fudge like. It was incredibly rich and I probably could have split it, but I didn't mind having all to myself! The mascarpone was a nice addition to tone down the espresso cake.\n\nMy only complaint is the service. The server and bus staff were very knowledgeable about the menu items and provided excellent recommendations. However, our server checked on other tables for frequently than ours. At first I thought I may have been being too harsh because it was a Friday night, and thus busy, but my dining partner commented on it as well.  I find it off-putting when you notice that your table being treated differently than others.

I was sold on the location and yelp rating (classic). \n\nAfter entering the establishment, I made my way to the high tops along the back wall. After thrusting myself up onto the stool, my very first observation was a gigantic pile of lettuce behind the counter in the back. I guess 2 or 3pm something on a Saturday afternoon is dinner/evening preparation time. Fortunately, other than being easily distract-able from ADD, there were no negative implications of the lettuce jungle on my experience. \n\nThe drink menu is diverse. My companion went with a wine, I a beer to start. \n\nI was actually starving but didn't want to get crazy with it off the bat. I did however notice many delicious food offerings make their way from the kitchen to other tables. My salivary glands rumbled noticeably. \n\nEventually my appetite overcame me, oozing out of very orifice. I glanced over to the menu. Ho-boy. Just wait until you check out what they're offering up in this place. \n\nAfter thorough deliberation because it's very hard to choose with all of the mouth watering choices, I made my selection. I wanted something hard in the mouth and crisp on the tongue. Fortunately they have a vasy array of bruschetta. I went with the pistachio herbed ricotta bruschetta (w/ lavender honey) for $5.5 over the goat cheese pesto $5.5 at the suggestion of the waitress. Dining companion ordered warm poached black mission figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto for $7.5. \n\nPS- after initial submission of this review I realized aside from talking about myself and what I ordered, I never described the actual food. It was DELICIOUS. The ricotta was smooth and flavorful. Bread crisp and hard on the tongue. \n\nI did observe some really good looking shit with chips I couldn't figure out what it was from the menu. I also heard through the grapevine that the truffled egg toast is to die. \n\nAnyways, definitely down to come back to try more stuff\n\nUPDATE: Came back to this place to try other stuff.\n\nI met some of mah gUrLzZzZzZ here yesterday at 4pm on a wednesday for hh.\n\nI ordered a pumpkin ale, brewery of which something weyer-something-or-other. Slightly too intense for me. Companions ordered wine. I subsequently ordered a milk stout. Delicious. \n\nFor edible options we ordered \"fancy chips\" which are basically crispy chips with seasoning and this orgasmic green aioli-type dip. We also went with the FAMOUS and CLASSIC truffled egg toast. I'm not particularly keen on salmonella in liquid form but this was delicious. I barely even noticed the yolk. Bread was the perfect lecture, cheese added a nice flavor, and the yolk seeped in just enough without causing too much of a sog. \n\nWe also ordered one of the cheeses, something that started with an e and I chose it particularly because it was difficult to pronounce. It was served with a fruit jam and 500 slices of baguette that was replaced when we were running low on the first batch.", "date": "2017-10-15 04:01:56", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 598, "average_stars": 3.94, "yelping_since": "2015-09-02 17:30:11"}}

Sometimes you want to go out but just don't want to be around too many people. Sometimes you're craving something tasty but not exactly dinner or dessert. Sometimes you want to experience an upscale vibe but nothing flashy. You're not trying to be difficult, it's just how you feel. For those nights, Tria is just the scene you might be looking for. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I went to Tria late at night; from a few other reviews it sounds like it gets pretty crowded around dinner, so the atmosphere is probably different depending on the hour. However, I thought the place was perfect for a chill night, when you just want to relax with a friend over some drinks and hors d'oeuvres. The ambience is dark, very pseudo-candlelight. I don't remember the music being so loud as to compete with conversation, but it was loud enough to have your attention. They played generally inoffensive stuff like \"High and Dry.\" \n\nI went with a friend after a concert, and it was the perfect place to unwind when the main event is over, but you're not ready to call it a night. Everything felt very clean and sleek, albeit a bit tight on space - very Montmartre. I can't imagine coming here with a party greater than four without feeling like you're hijacking the whole place. One thing I liked, was that its minimalism and low-key vibe make it a viable hangout spot for pretty much anyone of a legal drinking age, unlike most bars. I could just as easily picture a twenty-something hipster there as I could a retired wino. The website says, in regards to the unpretentious dress code, \"come as you are.\" That precious bit of philosophizing aside, I would still say there is a baseline dressiness; I mean, you are drinking wine. Even if you drink beer, let's be real: it's not going to be Miller High Life.\n\nAs for the victuals, our server gave us pairing suggestions based on the general flavor we were going for. Revealing ourselves to be the ignorant gourmands we are, we took both her suggestions point blank. It's fun how the menu groups together different types of wines and cheeses into categories like \"Stoic,\" \"Approachable\" and \"Smooth,\" such that ordering feels like an exercise in self-assessment. I got a Lighthearted red wine (the Dolcetto) and a Luscious cheese (the Nettle). My friend ordered a Bold red and a Racy blue cheese. I would say our choices reflected our personalities relatively well haha :)\n\nThe cheese comes with small slices of bread, as well as a complementary (and complimentary) spread of some kind. The Nettle came with a blueberry compote and the blue cheese with dried apricots. It was quite delicious! I would definitely come back again on one of those special nights where you're not really feeling here nor there. Come with a close friend or two who can appreciate understated sophistication... Tria is not the type of bar that will make your night fun by virtue of just being there; rather, it's the type of place that can provide a stylish backdrop for good conversation and good company.", "date": "2010-01-18 02:08:16", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 89, "average_stars": 4.29, "yelping_since": "2009-06-30 06:06:07"}}

The restaurant is small and they don't take reservations, but we figured we wouldn't have any trouble getting a seat for an early dinner on a rainy Tuesday. Wrong! The place was packed and noisy. We added our names to a list and waited around in the vestibule for a little while before moving to a bar seat where drinks were ordered, and then finally getting a table. Luckily, this gave us plenty of time to examine the menu, so we knew exactly what we wanted to order.\n\nWe decided to get a bunch of small plates, and then of course a cheese board. For himself, my husband picked spicy crab-stuffed peppers and a lamb sausage with white beans, peppers, and mint-feta sauce. (I don't really do lamb or sausage, but tried the beans and peppers with the mint sauce, it was very good!) For myself, I chose roasted beets with feta and pistachio herbed ricotta bruschetta with lavender honey - both were awesome. And then I made a kind of last-minute decision and also ordered us the truffled egg toast with fontina fontal, just because it sounded interesting. It was amazing, and I'm seeing after the fact that just about every review here seems to rave about it, so good choice!\n\nThen they brought out our cheeses, and at that point I was beginning to think maybe we'd made a bad decision in ordering so much food. If we go there again, I would probably do one fewer small plate and/or one fewer cheese. But we ended up with four cheeses, which they paired with four different condiments: a brie paired with a truffle paste, Reisling-Washed Sawmill Sleeper with Alagash-soaked cherries (this combo was especially amazing), a gouda with beet jelly,  and Montgomery's Cheddar with apricot honey. As we learned at Cheese 101, Tria's cheese prices are maybe a little high, but you get a much bigger portion than you do on most other cheese boards. So big that, for once, I did not finish all my cheese!\n\nOverall, I was really impressed with the food and the service was great, but I took away one star for the ambiance - crowded and very loud (not just the people, but the music).

I have spent many a nites and many a paychecks...and it has always been worth it. \n\nI came to Tria a few summers ago the first time, it was a long long evening and ended with last call. With among the last beers my brother & I had we decided to get some cheese which came with ultra ultra tasty honey. On asking our chirpy waitress (how she had a bounce in her step and energy in her voice at the end of a Saturday is beyond me) where that honey came from she asked us to write the question and told us Jon will get back to us. Sure enough the next  morning I got an e-mail from Jon (with my correct first name-a big effort) giving details on the honey. Also since the honey was sold in 5 gallon jars from a beekeepers house in Flourtown, PA he offered to sell a smaller quantity. I showed up at Tria the next evening and walked out with a pint glass filled with honey & covered with saran wrap (it looks suspiciously like beer on the street :-o). Long story to illustrate the wonderful service.\n\nTria sells Wine, Beer and Cheese. In addition it sells simple snacks such as sandwiches. The beer selection  on tap (and in bottles) is outstanding, they do tend to have a couple of local beers on tap, apart from Allagash white & Dogfish head.  If you are around here Christmas time I would highly recommend the Saison Dupont Christmas Ale (Avec Les Bons Vaeux de la Brasserie Dupont). In the wines I would recommend the Vouvray, it is a spectacular  wine from 89. (If you are in a group skip the glasses and get the bottle, really reasonably priced). I liked the way the menus are organized (Food, Cheese, Wine, Beer). The tria are organized according to taste, for instance zippy whites. The food is delicious, even simple things like the white bean spread are really good.  \n\nThe cafe itself is rather long with some tables in the front and along the walls. There is some outside seating in good weather months. I preferred sitting inside if I could get a place. This is not a place for huge groups, best as an intimate setting. To give some history on this place, it used to be the Alaska ice cream place before it became tria, so think ice cream place converted to bar, how large could it be. That said the interiors are spectacularly done and this place could hands down compete with one of those places from New York. \n\nA newer 'branch' of Tria has opened on 12th & Spruce, it can fit a larger group. I went there as a party of 8 last summer and they were able to seat us upstairs. While I like the original Tria, the newer Tria has a bit more space and the windows can be opened to the street so has a bit more Bistro like feel to it. There is an upstairs seating which is pretty cool.  \n\nWhile there are other options which have opened up of late in Center City, Tria was a great start in the Rittenhouse area and continues to be a great place to get good wine, beer and cheese. (And no they do not, I repeat do not sell cocktails, other assorted drinks). The servers are among the most friendly people and it is a lot of fun just sitting at the bar watching them wipe the glasses. \n\nOverall I have not given it a perfect 5 since it does not have any sort of happy hour and personally I would like to see some more non-American wheat beer (Sorry Schneider Weisse is not the only representative German beer). \n\nPS: Words from the wise, do not end your night with the African Mead (regardless of if it is only 3oz) :-o).", "date": "2008-04-06 02:54:34", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 3, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2008-04-05 03:46:38"}}

The first thing that catches my attention is Tria's \"Sunday School.\"  What is this, you may ask?  Every Sunday, Tria offers a cheese, wine, and beer for half off or slightly more and this is what they have to say: \n\n\"Learn about and enjoy a different not-so-common wine, cheese and beer every Sunday--at incredibly low prices. School was never this delicious! Limit one each per guest at the Sunday School price. Please, no returns: if you try it, you buy it. \n\nSo of course, I decide, why not...one of each!  The menu describes everything to the 'T.'  It lets you know the flavor characteristics, the region it came from...you get the drift.  \n\nThey have a great selection of local craft brews on tap that fits every beer drinkers palate.  From hoppy to light....\n\nWine selection is nifty too!  Anything from bubbly, to sweet, to dry, smooth and classy...\n\nTria offers you something to pair with everything.  It is a great place to get the night started or maybe even end.  That's because Tria really does not have a closing time.  They pretty much judge by the crowd, that's why they post their times as 'til ''Late Night.\"\n\nI had several cheeses that I kept slathering on the bread and the sliced italian meats board is wonderfully paired with several spreads...course mustard, pickled pimentos, garlic...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tria-philadelphia?select=moq-0wMPqeAeC5d1lS6Wkg#XL_eTp5E4E41DUMLvPL2iA\n\nThe next evening I just had to grab another drink and bite at Tria.  I walked in late in the evening and grabbed a glass of wine and ordered the Claudio mozarella sandwich w/ crispy prosciutto.  Imagine Caprese salad, with pesto, arugula, pimento and a mound of crispy prosciutto bits all over and lightly pressed and toasted!  DeEeELiShhhhh...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tria-philadelphia?select=moq-0wMPqeAeC5d1lS6Wkg#sFiRo322T3XarqPyim6mOg\n\nI will definitely be back when in Philly!!", "date": "2012-12-05 16:45:55", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 251, "average_stars": 3.87, "yelping_since": "2009-04-24 01:41:01"}}

Well, since I was running so late we decided just to go around the corner from his place to Tria.  I've always wanted to check it out, so it was cool.  \n\nWe got there close to 9:30 pm and the hostess asked us if we wanted seating, and if so, we would have to wait.  Well, before we could even make our decision, a girl at the bar offered her seat to my companion and I as her date was just around the corner.  \n\nFirst sign that you're in an awesome place:  Nice patrons : )\n\nSo we sat down and ordered some beers.  They had Alagash White on tap ($5 and one of my favorites), so I ordered that while my companion did a \"Tida\" description of what he wanted in regards to beer (\"ummm...something that isn't too heavy, but is kind of not too light, that's not too sweet..something that is...).  The bartender was able to decipher his beer jibberish and got him an awesome draft beer in which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I think he got him a Stoudts Gold Lauger ($5).\n\nRight when we got our drinks one of the cocktail tables became available and the hostess was kind enough to give us the head's up.  We got up to move and a server told us that she would bring our drinks over to us.  \n\nSecond sign that you're in an awesome place:  Nice host/servers : )\n\nSo, my companion and I sat down and decided to order some snacks.  We ordered the \"Sliced Italian Meats served with Balsamic Red Pepper, Caper Berries and Dijon-Garlic Oil\" ($10) and an order of the \"Goat Cheese, Roasted Garlic and Pesto Bruschetta\" ($3).  It literally took only four minutes for the food to come out.  \n\nThird sign that you're in a truly awesome place:  Fast service : ) \n\nThe Slice Italian Meats plate was much larger than I had expected.  We had 3-4 slices of I think 5 different kind of Italian Meats.  We were also served sliced baguettes to enjoy our meats on.  IT was fabulous!  \n\nThe Bruschetta was pretty good as well.  They were exactly like the ones that I make at home with pesto and garlic bought from Whole Foods on a baguette.  At least I know that I should throw some goat cheese on my homemade ones as well.  The plate came with two slices of baguette so we decided to order another one to absorb the bottle of wine we had previous to coming out.  \n\nNow, the last and final sign that you're in a good place:  Good \"snacks\" : ) \n\nI didn't really have any real \"food\" at Tria so I can only say \"good 'snacks'\".  Hopefully I can make it back there soon to try out the rest of their menu.  HOPEFULLY IT'S A SUNDAY TOO.  Their website has a \"Sunday School\" tab with the Sunday beer/wine/cheese special (1/2 off).  \n\nAll in all, it was a very nice snacking experience.  The bill only came out to $23 or so.  The service was really awesome, the servers were really, really nice (as were the patrons) and we were fueled for a long night of dancing and drinking.

Toted as one of the premier locations for wine and cheese, I assumed it was too fancy for my plebian taste buds. I don't know much beyond \"red, white, and sparkling\" when it comes to wine, and while I absolutely love cheese, that's not saying much. Mostly because I love all foods. All this to say - I was completely wrong in my assumptions about Tria, and I cannot wait to get back. \n\nThrow away the conventions that this wine/cheese bar is merely for the fancy folk. I showed up in sweats midday on a sunny Saturday (the plan was to go for a run, but we ended up at Tria), and I did not feel out of place at all. However, the ambiance is really nice and classy, so it could definitely be fancy if you wanted it to be. This location (as there are two others in the city) is pretty small. Table seating is limited, but there is bar seating available if you're lucky enough to snag two or three next to each other. Ideally, this place is geared towards parties of 4 or less. There's not really a lot of space, and the waits can be pretty lengthy if you're just planning for an impromptu visit. My one complaint about Tria is they don't have a huge space available to wait for your table, and they don't take cell phone numbers. Which means you have to carefully time it if you decide to wander away. We waited about 40 minutes for our table around 2pm on the weekend, and the place never really hit a slow point. Worth the wait though.\n\nIn regards to food, wine, and cheese? Amazing. Incredible. The bruschetta was to DIE for: we tried the Goat Cheese and Pesto and the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey. Both bursting with flavors. I could easily make a meal of just their bruschetta options. \n\nIf you make it past their snacks and bruschetta, be sure to check out their gourmet sandwiches, salads, and desserts. It was pretty difficult to make a decision, but I settled on the Prociutto Cotto Panino topped with Grana Padano and fig jam. The fig jam added a whole new level: an amazing combo of sweet and salty. The sandwich was hot, huge, filling, and delicious. You can tell every ingredient offered here is of the highest freshness and quality. \n\nEven in my sweats, with limited knowledge of wine and cheese, I never felt like I didn't belong. Both the wine and cheese menu are organized in a way that even the most ignorant foodies can identify something(s) they'd like; and if you don't? The staff was kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable. \n\nI'm counting down until my next visit to Tria. Central to downtown, it's close to shopping, Rittenhouse park, and other bars. It's the perfect place for a girl's lunch or a romantic date, but you can also come here in yoga pants and go hog.

(and no i haven't been drinking beer since HS!)  So when my Dad suggested checking out Tria for our first stop on the beer trip to Philly, i was excited that they had something i could easily drink and keep up with the rents: wine.  \n\nHowever my plan was nearly foiled when i sat down and saw they had a Russian River tap.  I kept saying to myself \"Please let them have Pliny, please let them have pliny\".  They didnt, but still the beer selection here was awesome.  The fact that they even offered Russian River (from California) was great.  Other beers included Belgian style ales... great for the rents, but not my cup of tea.\n\nSo i opted for one of their wines.  They had probably 20 plus different wines and it ended up being a very difficult decision on my part.   I started with the reisling, which was very sweet and very good.  Then i progressed to the Shiraz which was very sharp and immediate caused the heart burn.  but thats the price i must pay for good wine.   I will say that the wines run 8-12 bucks a glass, so choose wisely!    You'd hate to spend all that money for something you didn't like.  The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable, and the descriptions on the menus of the wine are very accurrate.\n\nThe food seemed to be unqiue and intrigueing, but expensive.  There were a lot of different cheese selections, but the plates i saw had more bread than cheese.    I would have liked to have seen a sampler platter or some kind of combination of cheeses.    The one seemingly reasonable thing were the different brushettas.  I got the goat cheese and pesto, which was awesome.  But it only came with two slices of bread.  For $3.50, thats a little much.  \n\nOverall, the prices are high, but the quality is great.  It would be a great place to grab a quick drink, but i'm not sure that i would be willing to go here on a regular basis.   Plus it bugged me that not only were the bathrooms unisex but they weren't even labeled as bathrooms.", "date": "2009-02-09 14:13:53", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 428, "average_stars": 3.85, "yelping_since": "2007-08-26 16:47:24"}}

However, last night I was disappointed in how they handled our table. \n\nWe let them know we were a party of 6, with 2 friends coming a bit later, so they sat the four of us with the intention of adding the occupied-but-had-the-bill 2-seater next to us once our friends arrived. Well, the two customers next to us had the bill sitting on their table for at least 20 minutes before they attempted to pay, and continued to sit there an additional 15 or 20 after they paid. Meanwhile, our last friends had arrived and were waiting to the side for the seating to become available. Our server asked if we wanted to move to a 6-seater tabletop or wait as the customers were clearly finished, and we elected to wait. After another 15 minutes, we let the server know we wanted to move to the 6 seater because the table next to us clearly wasn't leaving anytime soon (they left about 15 minutes after we moved). \n\nI felt a hostess or manager should have asked the customers who were finished and just chatting if they would mind moving to the bar since people were waiting for their table. As someone who has worked in restaurants, this is not an unusual request, especially in a place with limited seating such as Tria. I myself have been asked to free up a table before. \n\nAnyway, Tria is one of the most delicious places to eat in the city; however, they may want to rethink how they handle seating.", "date": "2016-01-26 19:55:15", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 27, "average_stars": 3.66, "yelping_since": "2013-02-28 00:29:12"}}

We walked inside and asked the hostess if we could please sit outside - but we were denied because they were \"trying to accommodate their indoor patrons,\" or something like that. Confused and hungry, we decided to let it slide and grab a seat inside, again having a preference of what was left (the high top by the bar was much more inviting that the cramped two-top near the entrance).
