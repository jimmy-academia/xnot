They used to be well staffed, food was good. However, over the years, the quality of both the staff and food has drastically changed. \n\nToday, I decided to have breakfast at Le Pain for the first time in a while. The tables were slightly dirty with crumbles and liquid. The server not attentive at all. He didn't offer me water or anything to drink. He came with a menu, it was wet. He immediately apologized then got me a new one. He continued to do other tasks until finally after almost 10-15 mins, I had to request if I could make an order. As I was waiting for my food, more patrons came in. I ordered the skillet baked eggs with salmon and dill on top. It took 20 mins for the food to come out. I saw my food sitting on the shelf for almost 10 mins before someone gave it to me. Even the girl that came 10 mins after me got her food before me and was already munching on it! The skillet eggs looked so sad when it came out. It looked like it was someone's first time attempting to cook. It was edible but definitely not worth $14. I also ordered a coconut milk latte, which my server later told me they ran out of coconut milk. Instead, I got almond milk. The latte was tasted like paper. On top of everything it took forever to get my check. But he took my cash right away. \n\nI have never been so disappointed with my experience at Le Pain until now.

I noticed that there are more GF choices here than there used to be - a quiche with GF buckwheat crust (veggie), plenty of salads with decadent cheeses and fun ingredients (I had the goat cheese salad with arugala, parm, pine nuts, lemon and olive oil...simply delicious).  Plus a nice selection of eggs and omelettes for breakfast.  My friend had their version of tuna salad, which had absolutely no mayo but he loved it (it's a dainty looking open-face sandwich with cucumber and radish slices).  Also had a hot cider that made my day after how cold it has been.  My friend Andrew had mint tea, which came with mint leaves in it - very very pretty and tasty!\n\nFrom fruit/yogurt parfaits to bread to salads and coffee drinks, everything that comes out of this place looks beautifully made and presented that way.

It was about 6 dollars for the cup but the soup was very good so that didn't bother me. He got the salmon breakfast and I got the Mediterranean platter. It came with babagahnosh, hummus, and quinoa.

I stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes while 3 servers were chatting and making coffee without attending to me, which I thought incredibly rude. When one of them finally noticed, I requested my smoothie without ice. That seemed to send the baristas in a state of deep confusion, so much so that one of them, after expressing her frustration to the others in front of me, told me she would have to talk to the manager to know how to handle this apparently very complicated situation. She disappeared in the back and after a few minutes a 4th random person (not the manager) came out and made my smoothie. The taste was good but it turned out so thick I couldn't even drink it with a straw. I had to go back to my office and eat it with a spoon.

The decor was adorable, very rusty and homey. It was nice to hear that the place would be BYOB until a liquor license was fully obtained. However when I sat down to peruse the choices, I was none too pleased. Perhaps I am just a carnivore, but I was looking forward to some hearty dishes. None of the entrees struck my fancy. Yes they are going for the healthy organic route but on a night of sipping of wine, I need something to hold me up. \n\nI decided on the Tuscan platter and my bf got the roasted salmon. The salmon came out first, dry and hard as a rock. It was completely inedible. The couscous was bland. My Tuscan platter took surprisingly long considering nothing actually needed to be cooked. \n\nThe roasted chicken looked like it was a filling entree. Maybe the appeal of the place are the tartines.

The examples:\n\nService - The hostess came by and greeted me by name because she just saw that I checked in on Foursquare. At first I felt mildly stalked and partially embarrassed that someone just called me out (in a good way?) for checking in, but she was actually very nice and I was busy checking in on Yelp when she said that so I couldn't be too embarrassed about using a completely meaningless feature in a city where I would never receive a tiny crown for my e-friendliness. Other than my new friend, the service was average.\n\nFood - I ordered the curry chicken salad tartine which comes open faced on five small pieces of rye bread. The sandwich tasted pretty decent and certainly looked appetizing, but my one issue with it was that if you are going to make an open face sandwich on a small piece of rye bread, you can't put so much curry chicken salad on each piece that when you try to pick it up with one hand it bends and falls from the weight of its own girth. This happened, but I ate the entire sandwich so it obviously didn't bother me so much.\n\nPrices - TOO HIGH. Everything I looked at on the menu for lunch made me say to myself, \"Self, that doesn't sound worth it.\" And then out of nowhere there was something for $7.95 (a seaweed salad), but of course to put tofu or something else in it, it was $3 more bucks. You can't eat for $10, lunch is going to run you $15 and it's frankly just not good enough for that. Again though, I cleaned my plate.\n\nAmbiance - This is actually a cool place inside and much larger than you would think from the outside. Tons of wood block tables, menus sitting on top, nice variety of long communal tables with two-tops and four-tops. Seems like a nice place to meet someone or three for a lunch or brunch.\n\nIt's like the Seinfeld when he always comes out even - this place has highs and lows, but in the end it is A-OK and I would go back if I was in the neighborhood.

Let me walk you through my experience:\n\n1. Coffee- at $4 per cup for generic black coffee is incredibly high, no free refills for $4.  What amazed me the most is that the coffee was room temperature.  It is very strong so we asked for hot water on the side which we were given at no extra charge.\n\n2. Croissant -  I wanted to order some kind of egg sandwich...but they don't have that for breakfast!  I could order an omelet for $12 and then pay for additional bread, but the bread is not toasted.  The waitress said that since their bread is made every day...they don't toast it.  Uhm...does that make sense?  I ordered a $4 croissant which was good, but certainly not worth $4!\n\n3. Baguette- I wanted to give it 100% chance of success, so I noticed that the baguette was today's special...although I was there for breakfast, I figured this Belgium based restaurant would do an excellent job. I first thought of getting the ham and cheese baguette, but the waiter suggested I get the parmesan version.  So I agreed.  About 5 minutes later, she serves me a sandwich which for $8 has been the most incredibly waste of money.  It was a short piece of baguette with a slide of cold ham and cold cheese, amazingly even the bread was refrigerator cold.  I figure it took 10 seconds to put this masterpiece together.  No sauce, no olive oil, no salt or pepper, just literary 3 ingredients slapped together. It tasted just as it sounds.  It turns out, she brought me the wrong sandwich!  Then she corrected it and brought me the recommended  parmesan version...I figured, this one will be much better.  Amazingly it was 99.99% the same thing!  Terrible.\n\nOther than generally terrible food and extremely overprice, the decor is nice to look at, the waiter was attentive.

I spent $17 for a \"rustic tuna tartine with cheddar\" and an iced tea. Firstly, a \"tartine\" translates as a \"slice of bread\", and that's pretty much what you get. A slice of bread with minimal tuna and a thin layer of cheese. For $13. I asked for sliced tomato on the \"slice of bread\", and it came with a very small amount of diced tomatoes sprinkled on top. When the \"slice of bread\" arrived, I avoided asking for sliced tomatoes because I imagined a $2 surcharge would ensue. The sandwich was tasty, but it's hard to enjoy when you feel like you've been ripped off. I appreciate the up-market nature of this place. It is certainly a step above your typical bakery/cafe.

I live next door so this is the perfect one stop shop for all my artisanal needs. I love their organic coffee. I am a nurse and a patient of mine raved about how this was the only place they knew of where they could get organic coffee, so of course I made sure to buy them some before one of my shifts and they were in heaven. I think their coffee is absolutely delicious and I really enjoy their lattes/cappuccinos as well. \n\nI love their food. Everything I have ever had there is great. It is quite pricey, however, if you are willing to spend a little money for a delicious meal, it's worth it. The tartines they serve, which is basically a large piece of bread with a spread on it, are absolutely delicious! I am in love with the ricotta, fig, apple, and honey one. The only downside is they are around 12-13 dollars for that one large piece of bread with a spread on it. I am unimpressed with the avocado one, it was basically the same large piece of bread but with an avocado spread and about four small piece of avocado on top. Again, around 12-13 dollars for that. Everything else I have ever had there has definitely been worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing and beautiful, it makes you feel as if you are in a european cafe. I couldn't believe it is a chain. It reminds me of a much much nicer au bon pain. \n\nI have been there quite a few times so I am reviewing all of my experiences and there was one particular experience that left me feeling uncomfortable. My parents had come to town for the day and I wanted to take them there for a light afternoon drink of champagne and a snack. When we were seated our server came over and took our order. He was new and had a thick french accent. Another server delivered our champagne and mentioned that our original server was unable to do so due to religious beliefs in regards to alcohol. It was a bit confusing but I guess due to that fact, he really didn't check in with us at all. I honestly felt a little uncomfortable because I knew just drinking the champagne was offending the person who was serving us. I have no issues with religious and cultural beliefs, I just think that it is difficult to work and serve at an establishment that offers alcohol if you cannot touch or handle alcoholic beverages. It was difficult to get his attention throughout our meal and we ended up having to go to the counter to get our check. \n\nI also use their app and order coffee to go, however, on more than one occasion when I arrive to pick up my order, they haven't made it yet or don't know what I am talking about.

Unfortunately, I can't really make that face (without a lot of plastic surgery and going blind) and have to do a little better than \"ARRRGHHHH!!!\"  Darn it that I'm not a cartoon.\n\nTwo colleagues and I went to this location for lunch and seated ourselves (as the sign indicated).  The place was already quite crowded so we took the big shared table in the small room in the front.  Almost immediately, a few other parties came and sat down with us at the table.  After about ten minutes, two of those parties walked out due to bad service/non-responsive service.\n\nWe browsed the menus as well as the specials on the board.  It was just a few minutes after noon, so none of us expected that any of the lunch specials had already run out, but such was the case with half of them.

She was told that she could not have that item at the table, that it was a take-out item only and ready-made.  She was told she could get the closest thing on the menu to it, but it had half the ingredients and was way more expensive.

This was not easy, as it seemed that everything we happened to pick was already gone, or not what we thought.  \n\nWe finally place our orders and we think there's a light at the end of the tunnel (as in, we were starving at this point and couldn't wait to eat!)  A lot of time goes by and our server barely made eye contact with us as he tended to the folks around us.  Refills on our waters were very hard to come by, and we had to ask for bread three times.  Then the bread came with one of the jams completely empty.  We asked for the refill on jam four times and it never came.  Frustrating, because I was really looking forward to trying the raspberry jam.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes with no food, someone from the kitchen came over to the table and asked who ordered the cobb salad (me).  I was informed that they ran out of eggs, and was asked if I wanted a substitution.  I basically had ordered the salad because of the egg, so I told her I would have to look at the menu for a new item.  A minute later, she came back and said she found an egg after all.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes (still with no water refills and none of that elusive jam!) my salad came (with no egg) and only one of the other orders.  Finally, my other colleague's entree came and it appeared to have an ingredient on it that was not advertised (mayonnaise).  She asked our server to check and see if there was mayo on there and he acted like she was insane, and took his time coming back with the answer, which delayed things considerably for her (she doesn't eat mayo, and that's totally her right to want to check. I would have done the same thing, as a fellow mayo-hater.)\n\nWe finally were able to all start eating our meals when the server came over with two hard-boiled eggs on a plate for me.  At this point I just had to laugh.  I was thankful they did bring the eggs (guess they found two hiding somewhere!) because the salad was pretty bland without it (there was hardly any chicken and the avocado was mostly browned and inedible).  I've never been given hard boiled eggs with a salad that I had to cut myself (except at a salad bar, and even then, most times it's cut up for you), but I wasn't going to complain.  I got the last eggs!  \n\nThe most ridiculous part of the experience though was the attitude of our server.  We had to ask questions because things were not available, including daily specials (who would think they'd run out by noon?), and because items were not given to us (like water refills and bread and jam).  Not only did he seemingly forget a lot of things, but he put on quite an act when he was talking to us (spoke to us in a very sing-song voice, smothering us in niceness) and then making faces (rolling eyes, etc.) when he thought we weren't looking.   Sadly, he did this to our table neighbors, too.  (One woman's entree came drenched in dressing and she had specifically asked for no dressing, as she is diabetic.  He actually argued with her and said that the dressing will be on the side, but that what she saw on her plate was part of the \"pre-made slaw\" which happens to be dressed.  She then reiterated that she specifically asked for no dressing on the salad at all and he said he'd be right back with the side of dressing.)\n\nFood good.

I don't do many reviews on this site or others, but when I come across an establishment that is just terrible in either quality of food or service, I just have to warn others and here I am about to slam a place I used to love.\n\nYUP, Le Pain Quotidien, The Daily Bread, will no longer be one of my Go-To places when I'm in Philadelphia and I'm sure I'll be sharing this story with my fellow crewmembers on our long flight home.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I'm gonna hate writing this because Le Pain Quotidien, located at 1425 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, has rapidly deteriorated in service over the past few months.  Quality of food and drink remain the same, good to great, but their service is absolutely dismal.\n\nI was seated in messy and dirty environment and it appeared as if I just missed the morning breakfast crowd.  Most tables were still littered with the remnants of a morning meal.  Where is the \"cleaning crew\" I wondered?   After looking around the place, I started up my laptop, and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait.  After about 10 minutes or so, I decided to start the old stopwatch and start timing.    After 15 minutes on the watch, my waitress, Julia, literally threw the menu on my table and just kept on going.  Kinda startled me because I wasn't looking up, doing the morning email thing.  I knew what I already wanted, so I just moved the menu away from the position where it had originally landed.  After a few minutes later, a gentleman sat next to me.  At around that time Julia returned to my seat and took my order, a Mocha and apple turnover, never looking up and making eye contact with the customer, eyes on her pad, writing like mad, then away she went.....\n\nI was going to tell that guy sitting next to me that he's probably gonna wait a while to be served but much to my surprise, Julia returned to our location and \"handed\" him his menu and welcomed him to Le Pain Quotidien.  Hum, I wondered....?\n\nDid I do something to offend this waitress?  Anyhow, we both waited for our order to arrive.  We were both totally engaged in whatever we were doing on our laptops.  After 30 minutes on the watch, the other guy's order shows up.  A full blown, warm breakfast, with his Caf\u00e9-Whatever.  After 42 minutes on my watch, my Mocha and premade Apple Turnover finally arrived.  By the time it finally got to me, the other guy was nearly finished with his full breakfast.  Before Julia took off again, I stopped her and asked her if I had done something wrong or somehow offended her, wondering to myself if that was the reason why this Philadelphian was so rude to me.  She finally looked up at me, first eye to eye contact, and apologized for the delay and stated that she was the only waitress there.  That was a flat out lie; I saw at least two others.  I asked her but why that other guy's warm breakfast was delivered so much faster than my simple order of coffee and cold cake, and again she apologized and again ran away.\n\nThat was that.  The other guy was in and out in less than about 35 minutes or so and I enjoyed the chaos of Le Pain Quotidien until I finally left; In and out at something over 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I'm sooo glad I wasn't in a rush.\n\nIf you're looking for a clean place with reasonably quick service, this place is hit and miss at best.  It's too bad too because the food is good, but not really worth the drama of a clearly understaffed establishment, with employees who don't know the first thing about treating a customer with respect and courtesy.  Too bad.  Over the past few months, I've noticed a trend at Le Pain Quotidien and it's clearly on the downhill slide.  Maybe they'll turn it around and once again become a favorite of mine, but for now, two thumbs down.\n\nThe Daily Bread: I don't think so.\n\nRant out.", "date": "2013-10-14 17:14:42", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 46, "average_stars": 3.36, "yelping_since": "2009-08-11 05:12:45"}}

No loud music, just the sounds of dishes and chatting. This sums up my favorite type of caf\u00e9 that I encountered when traveling mainland Europe. So happy to see this adorable caf\u00e9 here in Philadelphia and that little has changed since I first enjoyed this wonderful establishment in 2002. \n\nThings to know:\n1. The Quiche is fantastic, and just enough. It's paired with a delicious side salad of interesting greens, radishes and a pesto dressing. You'll also get a piece of fruit on the side. \n2. A mocha is made with real cocoa powder. Not chocolate syrup. Excellent! Also, a small really is bigger than I expected. \n3. At lunch, seat yourself and someone will come over (I didn't experience any issues here) \n4. Check out the wall of interesting spreads, oils and what not before leaving. Think Nutella-esque and then some. \n5. It is a bit pricey, but honestly, it was so quiet and delicious that I didn't mind it at all.

I went for Sunday brunch with a friend and it was almost empty! Which was a relief, but slightly unnerving. The prices are very fair, though. \n\nI ordered the Belgian waffle, watermelon refresher, and avocado toast. The Belgian waffle (singular because it only came with one), was a good brunch snack for those who had a bit to eat for breakfast but were still a little hungry. It was different from other BW I had before as it was very sweet, even without syrup. It was a great portion size for how hungry I was. The fresh cream on top of it was one of my favorite parts.\n\nThe watermelon refresher was sweet, but did not taste artificial. It tasted more like watermelon lemonade (very watery), but in a natural way. It went well with the richness of the Belgian waffle. I will say that they did not have many drink options.\nThe avocado toast was alright, my friend and I commented that this was something we could have made at home. It did not have the flare and richness that the other foods had.\n\nThe service structure is odd. If you are dining-in, you seat yourselves and  just hope a server sees you as they are not present on the floor like in other restaurants. There is one server for about 11 tables (that's just on the inside, there are about 6-7 tables outside the restaurant). It took about 15 minutes for a server to get to us, and that was after asking the barista if someone would be helping us.

But any positives ended there, within the first few steps in the door.  There were several people waiting to order take-out/waiting for their take-out and it seemed like everyone was in the way, especially myself.  I decided on a ham and gruyere sandwich.  When I told the cashier my order, he was very confused.  I said, \"its right there on the board- baguette sandwiches for take out\" but yet he still didn't know what I was talking about.  Luckily, a co-worker came over and saved us.  There is a very limited menu and this is the first week of being open, so I feel like the staff should know what is offered, especially if its on a huge board, complete with price, on the wall behind them.  I paid the $8.10 for the sandwich and had high hopes for it.  Based on the decor of the place and the price of the sandwich, I thought for sure I was in for a treat.  Wrong.  Completely wrong.  For whatever reason, I thought the sandwich would be warmed (my own assumption).  No, completely cold.  The baguette it was served on was the hardest peice of bread I've tried to bite into.  If I would have been mugged on the way back to my office, the sandwich would have been the perfect self-defense weapon.  All the sandwich had on it was ham, cheese and mustard.  Basic, and I like basic, but for the price I thought it would be all high quality items and heated up.  The gruyere seemed more like a very mild swiss and the ham was nothing special.  It was all very bland.  Luckily there was some mustard for taste.   I didn't feel like possibly breaking a tooth, or cutting up the inside of my mouth, so I opted to eat just the ham and cheese off the sandwich.  So, I paid $8.10 for a few bites of tasteless ham and cheese.  I'll stick to the delicious sandwiches from City Marketplace where there are reasonable prices and plenty of room to make desicions and read the magazines.  I pass Le Pain every morning on my walk to work, and I will continue to just walk past.  I will not be returning to this establishment.

I was a bit hungry and settled on getting something before the game. Since I was so close to Morton's, I thought about stopping off there, but realized I should stick to something more casual since I did not want to miss the start of the Eagle's game. Therefore, I decided to go to Le Pain Quotidien. \n\nI came in and was welcomed by the sight of a counter with all sorts of fresh bakery items and an overhead menu to my right and a large dining room straight ahead. The dining room itself was made up of a variety of smaller tables and chairs topped off with a communal table in the middle. Everything was also made out of beautiful wood giving it a nice, charming cafe feel.\n\nSince I was in a bit of a rush, I decided to just get a quick snack from the bakery section rather than sit down. Soon after that, the cashier, who was very nice and polite came over and took my order. Throughout my brief, but pleasurable experience, he described everything that I asked about in great detail. I eventually decided on getting a large Belgian chocolate brownie and a Hazelnut flute and both of them were very solid. The brownie had the perfect level of sweetness and was nice and moist, it just melted right in your mouth. The flute was also very good with a nice hard outside with a touch of flour and a nice soft inside.\n\nAltogether, Le Pain Quotidien offers a great assortment of delicious food and was a great place to stop off before the NFC Championship Game.
