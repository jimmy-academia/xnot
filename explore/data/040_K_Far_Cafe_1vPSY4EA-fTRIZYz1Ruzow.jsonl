In my case, the hiccup was that the dessert menu listed on the website won't actually be available until they start serving dinner in the coming weeks. I also didn't make it easy on anyone by putting in a pretty complex order (rugelach to go, tea, brown sugar ricotta toast and the salmon grain bowl--which wouldn't be available until after 11 AM and it was only 10:30ish--to eat in) and then making it even more complicated by asking for them to hold the toast so that I could have it after the grain bowl. Yet, they managed to handle all of that quirkiness with grace. My friend's food arrived--he got the grilled cheese on a Jerusalem bagel and seemed quite pleased with it--and Chef Solomonov, who was actually acting as runner (a smart move as the kitchen staff works out the kinks), asked if I wanted to have the toast now, and I decided to go for it, since I was pretty hungry and it was still a little while before 11.\n\nShortly thereafter, a thickish slice of toast arrived, cut diagonally down the middle, topped with ricotta and figs, with brown sugar and a strategically administered blueberry syrup. A home run. I (somewhat reluctantly) allowed my friend to have a small piece, and he fell in love with it, vowing to return just so he could have his own order.\n\nThe nice thing about the toast is that while it was sweet, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and the portion size was just right, so when my grain bowl arrived, I was ready to go. The two of them make a great combination, in whatever order you choose to eat them. The dish was called \"mujadara,\" and it included slow-roasted salmon, labneh (dusted with sumac), cucumbers and rice with lentils. It's a beautifully composed dish, and the portion is sufficient without being overwhelming. It could be lunch on its own for light eaters, or with the toast is quite satisfying for those of us who eat a little more but still don't want to be stuffed to the brim.\n\nThe physical space is lovely--there is a communal table and counter seating in addition to a number of tables toward the back--and it's light and airy and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and generally quite efficient, though they're still sorting a few little things like when to clear plates and handling the traffic flow--all to be expected when you've just opened.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have friendly people serving delicious food in a lovely setting. Have a little patience, as you should with any new spot, as they fine-tune the operation, but already it's very, very good. Looking forward to my next visit to Philly, so I can try the Rugelach French Toast from the soon-to-arrive dessert menu. :-)", "date": "2019-08-05 19:50:41", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 366, "average_stars": 4.11, "yelping_since": "2010-04-21 01:27:16"}}

I would've preferred the rugalach to be fruit options too and not only chocolate--But for those who like chocolate it was very chocolatey. Though you can't just get one-they give you three. My husband gave the pistachio sticky bun 8/10. It was on the drier side, like Jewish baked goods usually are.

While the AIP was not all that different from how I normally eat at home (mostly non-starchy vegetables, animal protein, healthy fats and very low glycemic fruit (once every few weeks), it was stricter. No nightshades, no chiles, no eggs, no coffee or seeds (sesame, cumin, rye, mustard et cetera), zero dairy, no sugar (honey and maple syrup are okay), no alcohol, no grains. The first week was tough and I felt lousy, but 5 weeks in-woo hoo!-do I feel one million percent better physically and mentally than I did 6 weeks ago. \n\nAs a treat for my Spartan existence and as an excuse to get a massage, a mani/pedi and some time in Rittenhouse Square's park, I ordered some of K'Far's Breakfast Bundles on line to be shared with a few friends for a socially distanced picnic. \n\nOrdering is very simple and if you don't have Venmo (I don't), you don't need it nor do you need to download anything onto your phone. You pick your items from their site, ordering starts every Wednesday, you specify the day and time you will pick up, your order is confirmed via e-mail and you are told to arrive at the specified time, call the K'Far number, give your name and your order will be brought out to you. Easy, right?\n\nI finished with my sybaritic activities a bit early, so I took a slow walk to S. 19th St. and called in to pick up. The patio is open for dining but it's tiny; however, you can order at their window, take away or eat there, assuming you can get a table. Of course, depending on your arrival time and what's been pre-ordered, some things may be already sold out. Everything was socially distanced/anti-COVID compliant with 6 feet markers for the order line, masked/gloved servers and runners and recyclable to go containers with no napkins or utensils. That caused me to have to text the folks I was meeting, asking them to supply that portion of the picnic, but I had no issue at all that K'Far didn't provide these things in my order. \n\nFor our picnic, I ordered the Boreka Bundle (3 borekas-potato, feta and swiss chard with cheese), the Jerusalem Bagel Bundle with 2 spreads (4 bagels and in our case, za'atar butter and vegetable cream cheese), a Mushroom Kubaneh Toast and 2 slices of walnut cake. My fellow diners were bringing iced coffee, fresh juice, cold seltzer and iced masala chai, though I could have purchased tea and coffee drinks from K'Far had I wished. \n\nI waited on the sidewalk for about 10 minutes for the order and enjoyed being outside in the sun and people watching. 98% of the people passing by and waiting to order were masked. Diners, of course, were not but if one had to go inside to use the toilet, a mask was required. A pleasant runner called my name, handed me my full bag of fresh, warm, fragrant food and I was off to The Square. \n\nThe borekas were just okay. We could see but not taste the potato in one. It was very flakey and covered in everything bagel topping. The feta boreka was light on the very mild feta. The winner, if there had to be one, was the cheese (kashkaval) and swiss chard. Stina, to our tastes, does a better boreka. \n\nThe bagel bundle was quite a hit. These are not your typical New York bagels. Jeruslem bagels are in a class by themselves. They are oval, covered in sesame seeds, and have airy innards. Not at all dense and heavy. The 2 spreads were marvelous and we couldn't decide which was a better choice. The cream cheese was light, not whipped, but not the dense Philadelphia stuff one generally gets with bagels. I won't say if anyone in the group used their fingers to get all of the left over spread that didn't make it to the bagels. \n\nThe Mushroom Kubaneh Toast is a rich, HEAVY dish. The bread is thick, tasty and holds up well to the thick layer of urfa pepper mascarpone and the heap of oyster, shiitake and mitake mushrooms crowning it. We all split this one order and doing so did not make any one of us feel at all deprived. If you order this and plan to eat it alone, consider it a meal in itself. One order for one person would be extremely filling. \n\nWe all ate to satiation then stretched, yawned, rested, chatted, drank our cold drinks and basked in the dappled, green light of the park before finally tucking into the walnut cake. 2 of the party expressed disappointment that I did not order the Pastry Box, to which I replied OINK OINK, but when we divied the walnut cake, it was unanimously agreed that these dense cake slices were an excellent and fitting 'after' for all we'd previously consumed. I love walnuts; in this cake, just barely sweet and very well textured, the walnuts shine. It was superb with our iced coffee. \n\nDon't get any combo of these bundles/dishes expecting a bargain breakfast. (The toast alone was $12-but rightly so...)

Something should be changed about the table setting as winter will be unbearable on that table!\n\nWe ordered the drinks- vermouth flight of 3 & the turkish green - first,  but watched it be prepared and just sit at the bar for more than 10 mins while our server attended to other diners and while the bar tender was greeting his personal friends. No one cared about the drinks or even think about brungibg to the table. When we saw our food arrive, we wanted our drinks and asked the server but she simply said \"oh yes\" but kept busy at what she was doing (no apologies) We saw her continue to wrap up the receipts for other diners; she could have easily signaled to the bar tender to get us the drinks, but no. So giving up I just walked over to the bar and got the drinks myself. That is a BIG NO in service. Then realizing that we don't know what is in the flight, the bartender finally walks over to us and explains (all in 3 seconds) the 3 vermouths. What frustrated us the most was that not one of them apologized for the delay! And, this is definitely not the Zahav/Abe Fischer experience; we have now been to Zahav about 30 times, and not once have we seen this type of service. They are simply impeccable there and even 10% of that attention and care here would be higher than what we observed. Btw, we also saw our neighbors' iced tea not show up on time!\n\nThe food was tasty but again not at the level of the other two restaurants and definitely not worth the price. We ordered the cauliflower (seasoning was great but the flowers were a little too burnt for my taste), moussaka (pretty in organization but tasteless without the little tiny amount tomato sauce), foie gras toast (very very tasty), persian lamb shank (great!), and the malabi (tasty as in Zahav, as the chef created this amazing dessert there!)\n\nI am not compelled to go back and would rather keep looking for a table at Zahav than go back here. Interestingly the only reason we tried k'far was because we couldn't get a table at Zahav.", "date": "2019-11-28 13:38:57", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 80, "average_stars": 3.95, "yelping_since": "2011-06-04 04:15:52"}}

But, I'll make an exception for Camille Cogswell. The talented Ms. Cogswell, whose superlative desserts have given us yet another reason to visit Zahav.\n\nThere's good reason to my discipline. The first few weeks of a bakery or restaurant are hardly ever reflective of what's it capable of. No such worries at K'Far. No apparent operational kinks. The service and execution is top notch! Mike Solomonov is personally present and bridging the kitchen with the client. You can see Camille walking around with the bemused smile of someone who's still not reconciled with her celebrity. The GM is cheerfully handing out menus to those waiting in line, warmly greeting those entering, and delivering the inventory reports of the latest item the cafe has run out of. I've ribbed her as \"the bearer of bad news\", and she mostly took it well... mostly.\n\nSpeaking of the items they run out of: in my experience, on weekdays, they're out of the pistachio bun by ~ 9 am, and the mini-babka by 9:15-9:30 am (cafe is open 8 am -2 pm currently, dinner service to follow later). These are the two most popular items, in order (though I prefer the texturally complex chocolate Babka with its accent of orange over the pistachio sticky bun - and expect my view to become the popular consensus in coming weeks). The next to run out will be two of the four Borekas (the flakier Feta usually goes first, and is my favorite). The Rugelach (my favorite of all their desserts!) are the next most popular item, but they'll be gone by 10 am. A couple behind me in line tried to guilt me that they'd come all the way from Nashville, hoping to warm my heart before I took the last available ones... (I left them 2). You can safely count on the availability of the Jerusalem bagels. I'd rank the egg and cheese highest, followed by the grilled cheese and then the Basturma.\n\nIf you're picking the optimal time to visit, I'd recommend 8:45 - 9:00 am on weekdays: popular items haven't yet run out, and the wait is minimal as the 8 am crowd (that's been waiting in line since 7:30 am) has already been served. Expect to wait in line 40 minutes on the weekend, initially.\n\nIf there's a weak link - and I'm stretching here to illuminate an area for improvement - it would be the coffee drinks section. My espresso drinks have been delayed, not been called out when ready, or have been served lukewarm on 3 of my 4 visits. The superbly spiced Yemenite Latte is excellent (and pairs off nicely with the grainy texture of the walnut cake), but it's not been served hot... twice.\n\nSo far, K'Far is mostly winning hearts.", "date": "2019-08-07 01:32:21", "useful": 19, "funny": 11, "cool": 18, "user": {"review_count": 644, "average_stars": 3.62, "yelping_since": "2006-11-05 01:05:25"}}

I read all of the glowing reviews for K'Far and happened to be in Philadelphia on a warm afternoon and decided to try it.  A lot of the reviews stated that they waited over an hour to get in but when we arrived on a Wednesday around 2PM the place was nearly empty.  We decided to eat outside.  The inside of the place was really aesthetically pleasing with a cool modern decor.  The outside was just a few tables outside and nothing special but we really came just for the food.\n\nWe weren't sure if they offered waiter service or what the deal was so I walked inside and asked the counter person.  She explained that they don't have physical menus and that you just seat yourself and scan the QR symbol, fulfill your order online and a waiter will bring out your food.\n\nWe put in our order but it was a bit of a struggle because the online menu service they use was quite buggy (freezing up, wiping out the cart, etc.).  However, after several attempts we were able to get our order in.  We noticed the taxes on the order were 18% and thought it was just another problem with the app so I went inside to ask about it.  The manager came over and explained that the Philadelphia tax was 8% and the ordering service charges another 10% which goes to them and is out of their control.  In addition they add another 10% service charge.  At the end of the day you are paying 28% between tax and service on top of the bill. \n\nThe food was fantastic and unique.  We were a party of 4 and ordered 2 Jerusalem bagel grilled cheeses and 1 Jerusalem bagel with smoked salmon and capers.  A Jerusalem bagel is not your traditional boiled and baked rounder.  It's a thin oval shaped baked bread covered in sesame seeds.  It's actually delicious and definitely different than anything I've ever eaten.  We also ordered an Arabic salad which was dressed perfectly and had a crumbled, soft feta that tasted like a cross between goat and feta among other delicious ingredients.  We also ordered a Kale salad that was finely chopped and had squash, pine nuts, shaved fennel and more....equally delicious.  \n\nFor drinks we tried the fresh brewed unsweetened citron ice tea and berry iced tea which were great.  We also had a coffee that was notable as well.  All in all, this was delicious and filling.\n\nOne thing to note is that if you sit outside like we did you may experience \"street people\" wandering into the outdoor area asking for money as we saw.  We also had a guy wander in and start yelling and cursing which made the experience a bit uncomfortable for everyone in our party.  I would definitely not sit out there again especially since it's so nice inside.\n\nThe bill after surcharges was over $76 so it was a bit pricey for what it was (3 drinks, 3 bagels, 2 salads).  However, the food was so good I will certainly return again.", "date": "2021-10-21 21:00:45", "useful": 9, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "user": {"review_count": 337, "average_stars": 3.49, "yelping_since": "2012-02-04 02:07:06"}}

Immediately, the space is beautifully decorated and every inch instagram-worthy, from the marble tabletops to the millennial pink galore. There was a small line to order at the register, but it moved quickly and gave us some time to peruse the menu. You have the option of either dining in or taking the food to go, and despite the caf\u00e9 being somewhat crowded, there was enough just enough seating to go around. After placing our order, we received our pastries on a plate, grabbed a number, and found a table to sit at. Although this is not a full-service restaurant, I noticed staff bringing water and utensils over to other tables and patiently waited for the same. I debated whether or not we were allowed to go grab utensils from the service station ourselves, but after half our food came out and we didn't want to wait until it got cold, my friend and I just went up and helped ourselves.\n\nOnto the food itself, we started off with the Grilled Cheese bagel. It was delicious and tasted like a whole grilled-cheese-tomato-soup in one with the balance of flavorful tomatoes, cheese, and za'atar seasoning. The sandwich came warm, but I wish it were hot and melty since it should be served fresh from the kitchen. We also shared a Tunisian Salad which was very underwhelming. The salad arrived messily presented with four sad little slices of tuna. It tasted fine, but was far from special. We asked for olives on the side since I don't like olives, but my friend found that the olives were quite flavorless anyway. I would probably stick with the pastries here rather than the prepared food. \n\nNext up, my friend and I split a few baked goods. The Potato Boreka was fantastic, with a savory curried filling. I really looked forward to the Pistachio Sticky Bun which was delicious as well, if a tad oversweet. I was missing a bit of the pistachio flavor, but the texture of the bun was spot on. Finally, we split a Mini Chocolate Babka bursting with chocolate flavor and probably a good alternative to the little Rugelach which are much tinier and more expensive than a nice fat Babka. To cut the sweetness a bit, I ordered the Yemenite Latte as well. Disappointingly, my latte came in a paper cup despite dining in and was not filled all the way. The drink itself was nicely spiced though and just slightly sweet, very nicely balanced. Again, not hot but almost lukewarm and as a note: you cannot substitute the latte with non-dairy milk, whole milk only.\n\nOverall, the food and experience here were pretty good, but did not quite live up to the hype. I might return to try some of the other menu items like the toast or other pastries, but the bagels and salads especially are quite overpriced for what you get.", "date": "2019-10-13 18:06:38", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 91, "average_stars": 4.43, "yelping_since": "2016-03-27 22:46:37"}}

My friends and I opted for late night dining, as reservations for groups of 3 or more are hard to come by nowadays due to their popularity. Our server informed us that they ran out of the Harissa chicken and the sour cherry lamb, and my one friend was very disappointed, as he really enjoyed the dish the last time he dined with K'far. However, it did not really dampen our dining experience, as we ordered a number of wonderful dishes to share. \n\nTo start, we ordered the baked feta, the foie gras toast, and instead of dessert, I asked for the konafi as an appetizer. \n\nBaked Feta - The baked feta appetizer is a block of warm feta, served with a harissa sauce. The harissa is spicy and flavorful, but I personally thought that the feta was way too salty. \n\nFoie Gras Toast - Thick cut Kubaneh toast drizzled with sweet molasses and topped with scoops of cold foie gras. I'm a general fan of all things sweet, savory, fatty and buttery. This was a decent appetizer, although I think the foie gras would've been an even more wonderful pairing with the toast if it was served warm, rather than cold. \n\nKanafeh - This traditional melted cheese dish is typically served as a dessert. I asked for the Konafi as an appetizer, so that my dining companions would get a chance to try this before they got too full for dessert. Melted cheese covered in a crispy noodle-like pastry, topped with a beautiful syrup - can't get any better than that. \n\nAs for the main courses, we ordered the salmon, the T'bit, the freekah \"risotto\", and the ribeye cap to share. \n\nSalmon - The salmon skin was delicate and crisp, and the fish was cooked perfectly. The salmon laid on a bed of mujadara rice. If I was dining alone or with one other person, I would say that this portion is a bit small. I had no complaints since there was a group of us and we were sampling everything. \n\nT'bit - This is a comfort meal for sure. It was a rice casserole filled with braised beef and vegetables, encased in grape leaves and served with a bed of dressed romaine. However, I think the dish could've used more flavor, because I found mostly rice and not enough other filling in the dish. \n\nFreekah \"risotto\" - If you are are a fan of mushrooms. I highly recommend this. I love the texture of rice and nuts, and I loved the roasted pumpkin topping. \n\nRibeye Cap - I saved the best for last. This was my favorite dish of the evening. We received four portions - enough for each of us to have a sampling of the flavorful, tender beef. I highly recommend this. The caramelized fennel was a wonderful accompaniment to the beef. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered a malabi custard, as this is my favorite dessert at Zahav. While the presentation is more casual, it did not take away from my rose-flavored custard, topped with a sweet jam and almond brittle. \n\nThe kitchen generously gave us a wonderfully tart guava sorbet topped with fresh pomegranate and coconut shavings, as well as a warm chocolate babka with ice cream. We really appreciated the service and the complimentary desserts. Overall, I was torn between 4/5 stars. I would say this is more of a 4.5 star experience. I knocked off a star, because some of the dishes missed the mark a little on seasoning, and I realized that most of our dishes contained some form of rice. I'm Asian, I love rice, but at some point, we felt like it was a bit much. I will definitely have to come back for their breakfast pastries! Overall, I highly recommend K'far for dinner!", "date": "2019-12-06 17:04:22", "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 159, "average_stars": 3.83, "yelping_since": "2013-12-16 19:43:04"}}
