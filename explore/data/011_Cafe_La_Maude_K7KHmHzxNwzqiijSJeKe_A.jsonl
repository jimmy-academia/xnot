My boyfriend and I made the spilt second decision to visit this establishment after passing by another brunch establishment. I can see why people do like this place but it's just not for me.\n\nIt's a cute little cafe with an ethnic twist. We were seated quickly by whom I am guessing was the owner. He was sitting with his family and we were seated a table down from them. I looked over the menu and my heart sunk. Nothing sounded good...but I settled on an omelette. Maybe cause I'm a vegetarian? Not sure.\n\nThe coffee arrived first which was quickly followed by the meal. The coffee here is La Columbe and it's SO good but you don't go out for brunch just for coffee. I took a few bites of my omelette and just felt sad. For ~$18 I felt more regret for choosing this location.\n\nParts of the meal were okay, like the fresh fruit and potatoes - these were actually very good. But the fact of the matter is I couldn't find anything on the menu that sounded good. Usually I do more research on places before just showing up but I failed to do that here. \n\nIt makes me sad to leave this review but I really can not recommend this place.", "date": "2016-11-23 17:48:18", "useful": 11, "funny": 5, "cool": 5, "user": {"review_count": 324, "average_stars": 4.24, "yelping_since": "2012-05-27 12:32:00"}}

Latte Lounge, the owner-operated coffee shop that used to occupy the space was down-home beautiful, a place where neighbors would meet and greet and live jazz performances were sometimes held. It had a lot of soul, which helped me overlook just how run down it was.  When it closed a few years ago after a nearly 10 year run, I and the fam were disappointed. It wasn't perfect, but it was a place to grab a coffee, gab with the owner and a neighbor or two, and maybe read to my little girl from the generous collection of donated childrens' books.  But Cafe Maude not only brought back the sense of family that we missed, they brought a level of excellence and professionalism to the business that is very much a rarity in these parts. The space was completely gutted, the basement excavated, and a sophisticated Parisian-modern establishment cleverly shoe-horned into a modest row-home ground floor. A spectacular transformation. The owners had a lot of input in the design, but utilized a professional designer (Robin Stellwagen) to guide the planning and design process. This was a wise move, and shows in the attention to the layout, use of materials and simple but important details, like the cleanable surface on the condiment counter. As a hospitality designer I may be biased, but I have seen so many costly mistakes on DIY projects that It has become a pet peeve of mine. \n\nIn spite of the few negative reviews about service on this blog, which I am really surprised to read, I would say that Cafe Maude's service is their strong suit. Quick and professional, and completely attentive to the customer. Very little if any barista sidetalk going on here. It is all about the customer enjoying their experience, whether it is a delicious latte with a French pastry, or a fresh omelette and salad. But I DO have to agree with a few negative reviewers who were upset with the service packs of butter and cream cheese offered. Nothing says inauthentic more than this. Take a second to apply the condiment and know your customer's preference (schmear? loaded? touch of butter?) and you will have won over your customer. I hope the owners toss out the service pack concept, which is especially jarring given how wonderful the place is otherwise.\n\nI appreciate that Cafe Maude has a depth of staff including a charming bus person to bring food up from the kitchen and clear tables, although the owner is just as likely to do this. It also helps that they usually have more than one person behind the counter when it gets busy; a register person AND a barista. \n\nMy colleague Zaid who is from the Middle East, loves this place and finds the dishes delicious and authentic. He not only enjoyed his lunch, but got to speak his native Arabic with the charming owner, Natalie. The design is clean and tasteful, and I am especially impressed with the a la carte kitchen and Parisian style bathroom they have carved out of the basement. Clearly the owners take great pride in their establishment and have invested a great deal of treasure in the building AND the business.

The owner was super friendly and knew all his customers. The restaurant itself was classy without being overly pretentious. We had the seating by the windows and they were the best, having a lot of sunlight as you enjoy your beautiful morning breakfast.\n\nThe price was high but for the area and the quality of food, I doubt anyone is complaining. Everything on the menu looked delicious and we couldn't decide. Our waitresses was very knowledgeable and helped us picked some awesome dishes. \n\nWe got the sweet potato benny and petit steak breakfast with a side of applewood bacon and French fries. We also ordered vanilla chai latte and the berrylicious French toast for the dessert.\n\nIf I could only use one word to describe our food, it would be \"beautiful\". I did not expect art on a plate for breakfast when I came here. The colors and presentation was very clean and appetizing. My sweet potato Benny plate was very good. One of my poached eggs was over cooked but everything else was simply delicious. I love that the hash were made from sweet potatoes, they added a sweet contrast to the savory Lebanese sausage. \n\nThe petit steak breakfast had similar elements to my dish but tasted even better. The steaks were tender and perfectly seasoned. I really appreciated the fact that their hash came with mango chunks. They really nailed the balance of flavors here, sweet and savory. The French fries were very crunchy, just the way I like them. The Apple wood bacon was crisp throughout the meal. This place really knew how to elevate simple ingredients!\n\nMy vanilla chai latte was one of the best I've had and again, the presentation was just beautiful. My favorite dish however, was dessert. We had our waitress to thank for that, I apologize for not asking for her name but if the owner is reading this, just know that your waitresses were terrific.\n\nThe berrylicious French toast came with hazelnut spread and br\u00fbl\u00e9e banana with finely chopped mangos and berries topped with this sweet, creamy sauce that tasted like heaven. I had no complaint on this dish whatsoever.\n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience and I recommend everyone to check the restaurant out. The high prices mean I may not come back as often as I would like to but whenever I can, I definitely will!

I checked out the place on yelp and seemed pretty neat, right down my brunch alley [who can resist a victorian-type wallpaper?], and the mix of the two cuisine definitely had me intrigued!\n\nThey carry La Colombe coffee, which to me is always a good sign, but then again as a Latte drinker, it really depends on your barista too. The latte turned out pretty damn good, won't lie, as I am especially hard to please when it comes to coffee. Almost ordered a salad but then the devil in me wanted bread and something new, so I ordered the shrimp sandwich, forgot what the real name it, but it was VERY good, full of shrimps! Got a fresh tomato gazpacho on the side...would not recommend it, kinda bland. My friend ordered the 2eggs with Gruyere cheese and potatoes. Potatoes were to DIE for, wish i stole some more from him. Only complaint, it was inundated with cheese, maybe a little less so we could find the egg? \n\nI liked the atmosphere. It was one of those place where I could choose to be casual, or if I'm feeling fancy, I could roll with that too!I do have a weakness for fancy brunches! I would like to go back, but just never got around to it. For the price, I guess I was looking to be wowed a tad more? Not sure, something just did not add up, probably the guy talking about wrestling next to us, killed the whole warm and fuzzy feeling os summer :/  I liked how they had little pastries and macaroons all over the store and the open doors looking out the street and outdoor seating is definitely charming. \n\nI would say go check it out, if you don't absolutely love it, you will definitely have a good enough time :]", "date": "2012-07-31 03:53:18", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 144, "average_stars": 4.02, "yelping_since": "2010-12-14 00:23:57"}}

It was a bit expensive at $10.50, and like the owner told me, he prefers it \"like we make it at home, too.\" I love the honesty and openness.\n\nI was particularly impressed with how hospitable the owner Gabby and barista Christina were. Great people to talk to and very friendly and genuine. I felt like I was at home.\n\nDespite not having a dedicated wait staff and needing to order at the counter, the food was delivered and my water was refilled promptly by both the owner and employee.\n\nChristina sold me on how great the place was when she raved about how great management was and how she loved working there.\n\nRecommended for brunch or breakfast or just coffee. Very chill and laid back, people seem to love just spending time at the beautiful cafe with its Mediterranean and European style.\n\nThe actual space doesn't afford the restaurant the luxury of having servers, but for the prices, I don't prefer to order at the counter.

Considering I'm a food critic (edit: basic white girl who considers brunch a birthright) I feel it my duty to issue the following PSA: 10Best's article is wrong, wrong, so wrong *Gretchen Weiner's voice* I don't think Gretchen's father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear that Caf\u00e9 La Maude doesn't offer the best brunch in Philly--it offers the best brunch in the world. Save your money on plane tickets and even on your cable bill; instead, get your foreign policy on a plate in this Lebanese and French eatery. Unlike anything you'll see on a cable news channel, everything at Caf\u00e9 La Maude is extremely easy to stomach #NOTfakenews\n\nWhen I declare that everything at Caf\u00e9 La Maude is easy to stomach, I can do it with confidence because I tried 6 things (judge me). The Open Faced Mediterranean Burrito had so many layers of flavor Trident Layers Gum should be paid a royalty. The Saumon Fume a Cheval took me so far into Flavortown I'm pretty sure I saw Guy Fieri. The Shakshuka sha-shook my tastebuds---and my exceedingly high expectations. The Berrylicious Pain Perdu? Stahppp. It was worth giving up the bikini body I never had.\n\nThe only thing I like as much as incredible food is great company. I was lucky enough to have the BEST company during my visit here--and by company, I mean the Caf\u00e9 La Maude employees #sorrynotsorrymom We visited Caf\u00e9 La Maude with my family to celebrate Memorial Day. After reading about the infamous wait times at Caf\u00e9 La Maude, my sister and I arrived early to put our name in for a table. We were surprised when we were called to be seated after only a few minutes. The problem? On their way to the restaurant, my parents decided to take a leisurely, untimely, and unannounced tour of Spring Garden Street. Realizing they were going to be tardy for our party, I made the hospitable hostess aware of our predicament. The hostess, Andrea, was incredibly understanding; she allowed us to keep our place in line AND graciously worked to seat us immediately when my parents showed up (un)fashionably late. A big shout-out to Andrea--Lebron needs a lesson from you, girl, because you're the real MVP. \n\nJust when we thought our experience couldn't get better, we met our server Jonathan. Have you ever been referred to as a magical unicorn when you're stuffing your face like a barnyard animal? Thanks to Jonathan, I have--and it made me feel like a mix of Fergie and Jesus. Jonathan delighted my family so much I'm sure they're somewhere drafting adoption papers #StayGoldenPonyboy From the owner to the servers, every single person working in this restaurant is a gem. Not to be dramatic, but I'd take a trip to see these any of these diamonds over an engagement ring any day (just don't tell my boyfriend).\n\nSeriously though, please recognize that I took my Yelp profile out of a 4-year hiatus to tell you about the perfect food and service at Caf\u00e9 La Maude, which will surely result in even longer wait times here on the weekends.

My brunch world just got turned upside down.\n\nSo, you can go and wait 1.5 hours down the street at Honey's (not that there's anything wrong with that), or you can stroll by all of the throngs of 20-30 somethings and take a seat in a seriously charming little French bistro. Not saying there was no wait at all, but with a super small dining area, there were really no more than a handful of people waiting at any one time during prime brunch hours on Sunday morning.\n\nThe walls have adorable wallpaper accented with a black chair rail and ornately framed paintings of the owners dog (who, I am told, is frequently present in the cafe). There are little high top black tables, small marble tiles on the floor, and sweet French-countryside-esque banquets holding coffee accoutrements, water pitchers, and the sweet handmade, eclectic coffee mugs which serve your perfectly brewed La Colombe roast.\n\nOn one end of the bar, logically, the end facing the large glass windows overlooking 4th St, you'll find homemade pastries and cookies in little glass domes: shortbread cookies, baklava, rugelach, and something chocolate that I probably should've bought so I could figure out what it was. They don't make the croissants in house, but it doesn't really matter--they are perfect. \n\nThe couple that owns this place is there waiting on you hand and foot. They are kind, attentive, and make you feel like family. They'll stop by frequently enough that you are never left needing anything. Also, they are super kind to their regulars. \n\nWhen you sit, you are handed a small clipboard with the daily specials, which includes about 6-8 different plates. This is in addition to the very expansive French-Mediterranean choices that are regulars, written on the mirrored board above the bar. The options, as mentioned, are a good mix of classic French food with some Mediterranean flavors thrown in for good measure. I am told the food is French-Lebanese. I had an open faced sandwich called the \"N-Liberties,\" two english muffins topped with hummus, avocado, fried jalapenos, caramelized onions, crumbled sausage, all topped with a fried egg. Oh and with potato pancakes on the side as well. It was absolutely to die for. My dining partners finished most every bite on their plate--a croque madame made to order with scrambled eggs instead of over easy (they will accommodate every request), and a Mediterranean open faced burrito the size of my face.\n\nI love this place. I wanna come back every weekend. Actually, I wanna quit working normal day hours so that I can become a regular and just chill out with a perfect coffee, and a perfect pastry while doing whatever it is people do while sitting all day in coffee shops.

My heart sank and my stomach LURCHED when I saw the groups of people waiting by the entrance. FMLLLLL. I hate waiting, especially when my peptic ulcers are gnawing. \n\nMuch to my astonishment, there was a seat for two that had by golly just opened up near the entrance and we were seated.......get ready for it.....IMMEDIATELY, at cafe la-fucking-maude.

They have outside seating, which is a plus, but not on a super hot day. For being such a small establishment, the menu is EXTENSIVE. I was shocked. It may be overwhelming to some, but not me. I need options, and they give them to you. The seating is close, but it is a caf\u00e9. They also have another room for seating in another room which you may not see at first. I don't know if this is policy, but we seated ourselves which was no issue at all.\n\nAnd this establishment is BYOB!\n\nI pregamed. I searched and reviewed the menu before hand. I ordered the Berrylicious Pain Perdu. This was RIGHT up my alley.\n\nOur food came out relatively fast. My dish was PERFECT. All od the differenr fruit flavors fused together with the sweetness of the cheese, delicious. I ordered a side of turkey bacon, which i greatly appreciated that it was even available. That, could have been cooked more, but that's my bad for not asking for it to be fried hard. I tasted my friends sweet potato hash, and it was also very tasty. We had brought champagne to have mimosas. We ordered pitchers of OJ, which could have been bigger for the price, but the orange juice was fresh, and scrumptious... sooo who cares! \n\nThe container to chill the bottles was a tad small. Our bottle barely fit in it. But one of the employees came over and said she'd have to order bigger ones so that all bottle sizes could be accommodated. When they tried to ice our bottle all of the water from the ice spilled everywhere. They cleaned it up super fast. very attentive.\n\nOur server told us it was his first day. When it was time to pay, he somehow swiped my card twice. Once for my transaction, and once for another. I notcied this not long after i left. I called, told them what the problem was, and they took all of my information, and told me that someone else would be calling me. When i did talk to this lady, she was nice and said they'd review their transactions to give me a refund if they were at fault. This was on a Monday. She called me back Wednesday to tell me they were indeed at fault, and my card was being refunded. \n\nGREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! No bitterness on my end, and i completely plan on returning.\n\nPS: All of you Green Eggs Caf\u00e9 fans... this places compares, and KNOCKS the competition out of the roof. Wayyy better than GEC, and a wayyyy bigger menu. More space, and faster service. Definitely worth trying.\n\n***2nd visit a week later Labor Day***\n\nWe had about an hr's wait. They chilled my bottle for me as we waited to be seated. The owner and his wife are what every business owner should be. Hospitable, kind, and they deliver EXCELLENT customer service. They talk to their customers, not on a business level, but on a friendly note. Like they appreciate your business. They stopped at our table numerous times just for small talk even tho it was super busy. That alone will keep me coming back.\n\nThis visit I insisted that my family come with me to experience this greatness. Our food took a little ling coming out, so what did they do? They gave us a free appetizer. I had the salmon burger which was DELICIOUS. The food is uncomparable to any other Mediterranean food places. Why? BECAUSE IT IS AUTHENTIC. I wouldn't be surprised if they have their mothers back in the kitchen cooking. Knowing my name from when i checked in for a table, I'm walking down the street and the owner comes running after me calling my name. I had forgotten my sunglasses.

For the first two minutes, I just figured they were being attentive, but when three different, bored looking wait staff asks if you're ready to order 8 times within 5 minutes of receiving the menu... difficult not to see it as pushy. \n\nAfter we order, the table that's very close, right next to us, gets their food. The guy tells the waitress immediately \"oh, I asked for the sauce on the side\" and clearly the entire plate was smothered in it. The waitress' response? \"It's so good, you'll be licking it off your fingers, trust me\" and walks away. I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it. $23 on a meal that you're told to enjoy the way it's given to you, despite your stated preference??? \n\nCoffee was good, service very timely, as again, despite being readily seated, no reservations accepted and the high prices, the employees give you the feeling you're at a busy nj diner. Food was absolutely sad and disappointing. My entree came with wheat bread at the bottom...more like a pepperidge farm wheat thin sitting in a bewilderingly bland mess, soggy, but those factory holes in the \"bread\" were still retaining their shape. My avocado was brown. The rest...its not that I can't recall, it's more that I had no idea what I was even seeing on my plate to begin with. The only yummy part was the petite side salad which occupied no more than 1.5 square inches on my plate. As my friend and I are picking at our bizarre, expensive messes, our third friend comes in and grabs the seat at our table. We explain to him that we're just finishing up but if he didn't mind waiting for us, he can join us on our walk afterward. A waitress comes by, asks what he'd like and he pointed out that as we're halfway through our meal, he'll just take some water. \"No problem!\" They take our barely eaten mush away, refill my coffee and we continue our engaging conversation. Five minutes later, our check arrives. Ten minutes later, we're all settled and I'm finishing up my coffee and conversation when the owner comes by and, I fucking kid you not, ASKS US TO LEAVE. Paraphrasing: \"we have so many people waiting\" and, word for word \"I WAS NICE ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOUR FRIEND TO SIT HERE\". Excuse me??? I asked him BEFORE we were seated for a place for 3. I have not lingered past any appropriate length for brunch (that 2hr parking is a strong motivational force), we sat through a dismal meal, with pushy and hovering waitresses, and despite all of this, I STILL tipped 25% because that's what I always do as the bare minimum. I was stunned. Out of all of the restaurants I've been to all over this Earth, I have *never* been asked to leave to make room for others. And certainly not so haughtily. Sadly, I couldn't think of a way to say this to him other than \"you're out of your god damn mind\" so we got up and left after I had my last sip of coffee. Sadly, had he waited an additional five minutes or less, we would have been getting up on our own accord.\n\nTLDR; what an irritating, arrogant, and unappetizing euro-fusion mess. MAYBE I was unfortunate enough to come here on an \"off day\" for the cooking staff, waitresses and owner, but I think it's more accurate\u200b to say I got a real glimpse at what this place is all about and it's garbage...not even the kind Frank Reynolds would enjoy.", "date": "2017-06-04 04:06:14", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 6, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2015-02-09 17:19:22"}}

The portions are large and the dishes are tasty. They really put effort in making the food presentable and unique! \n\nMy main complaints are the service. When my friend and I arrived, the man who seemed to own the establishment (as he did not have an apron on and seemed to walk around often greeting guests) abruptly asked us how many people there were and consistently reminded us every 5 minutes that they'd get busy (with no tables available soon) if our friends didn't show up quickly. This was ok - I totally understand as a server myself that you want your guests to be aware of the situation! But what ticked us off was his demeanor. While he was rather standoffish to us, he was INCREDIBLY nice to other (Caucasian) guests who were either seated or walked in. His short and rash exchanges with us vs his courteous jokes and friendly attitude with other customers was off putting. This made us feel uncomfortable as minorities and a tad unwelcome. This was actually the second time my friend encountered this type of treatment as a minority here; she recognized the man right from when we first saw him outside. \n\nThe other servers, however, were kind and offered excellent service when we were seated and dined! \n\nI would also like to note that the prices here are more expensive for brunch as opposed to other places in the city. Each dish is roughly $17-30. It's worth it for some dishes, but definitely not for others! For example, the Mediterranean Platter is literally yogurt, hummus, pita and veggies for $19.50! In this case, you'd be paying for presentation - which is totally fine but not necessarily bang for your buck. \n\nLastly, parking here can be an issue sometimes! The location has no parking lot so street parking is your only option. It can be quite competitive as it's a mix of a lot of residential townhouses and a couple other eating establishments! \n\nOverall, it's a decent establishment but I will probably not be dining here again soon.", "date": "2020-10-23 06:17:56", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 338, "average_stars": 4.01, "yelping_since": "2013-08-17 23:09:42"}}

I was visiting my brother who lives in the area. We were a party of 4 + a baby and we were greeted by a very friendly gentleman and was seated promptly. The place looked really cute and he seated us at the corner so we'd have more room and be more comfortable. This is where our pleasant experience stopped. \nWe ordered our food and a few minutes later the waiter brought a small plate of fresh mozzarella and tomato to our table. We assumed that it was complementary and I started to feed my daughter the tomato and cheese. The waitress rudely came\nOver to our table and accusingly said \"did you order this?!\" And I was so confused and said \"no\nBut it was brought to our table so we assumed..\" She cut me off and said that she can't take it back because we already ate it. So we said just add it to our tab, she still decided to continue to say more to make us feel really uncomfortable for HER mistake and basically make me feel guilty for feeding the food to my hungry one year old daughter. This alone spoiled our entire meal and we were not able to enjoy our lunch. She then hovered over us while we were eating our lunch and once my mom and brother finished their meals,  she immediately grabbed their plates. My mom wasn't quite finished and still had another bite or two left and she stood there until my mom finished to snatch her plate away. When we all finally finished our meals suddenly our waitress was nowhere in sight. I had to take my daughter to the front and pay where there were three waitresses who were clearly annoyed by the fact that I stood up to go and pay my check. I came back to my table and a waitress followed me. She started grabbing at the rest of our plates haphazardly asking if we needed anything else. (Uh.. You just saw me Pay the check so what else would I need?) \nI have NEVER been treated so badly at a restaurant and have never experienced such poor service in my life.

Cafe La Maude is the epitome of a small European restaurant serving high quality coffee drinks and brunch foods. The menu looked absolutely overwhelming since there were so many delicious-sounding foods listed. The prices are on the higher side, but this is one of the rare occasions where I would say that the price is totally worth it.\n\nI had the Le Chef Omelet, which was recommended to me as the best vegetarian omelet on the menu. I had to ask for a recommendation because it would have taken forever if I had to decide on my own. Absolutely loved that the servers were super helpful and accommodating to any dietary preferences or restrictions (they told me that they could make any substitutions or alterations to make something vegetarian), which is awesome, especially after having to deal with some restaurants that are really stubborn about substitutions.\n\nThe omelet dish that I received was so amazingly delicious. It came with a really refreshing side salad and fruit salad along with another side of potatoes. The presentation was Food Network worthy - I spent a good 5-10 minutes to take pictures of (and with) the beautiful dish. Regarding the flavors, I thought that the ingredients in the omelet meshed so well together. There was the slight crispiness from the cauliflower along with the creaminess of the avocado and hummus and brought together with fresh veggies and perfectly cooked egg whites. The potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning and crunch as well, and I could tell that the vegetable and fruit salad were very fresh. The portion was pretty large as well. I honestly have no negative things to say about this dish - I wish my stomach were larger so that I could have finish every last crumb! \n\nMy sister, who is much younger and much pickier than I am, ordered the grilled cheese and a large hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was so wonderfully frothy that my sister could not have been any happier (she's a huge chocolate fan). She thought the grilled cheese had great flavor because of the really good melding together of the different cheeses that they used and wasn't too buttery.\n\nI do think that a large part of my love for this cafe has to do with the ambiance. the decor is very cute, European, and definitely picture-worthy. There seem to be many locals who frequent this cafe, and it's very refreshing as a newcomer to see individuals coming in one-by-one, giving each other friendly hellos and chatting it up on a Wednesday morning. The owner joined many of these people in conversation, which just added to the cozy and intimate vibe of the cafe. The cafe is also pet-friendly, so my sister and I were joined by an adorable chihuahua during our brunch! \n\nI love all things about this cafe and think that the pleasant service and delicious food are definitely worth the price that you pay. I will undoubtedly take all my visiting friends to this cafe to show them the best of Philadelphia.", "date": "2015-04-01 22:29:55", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 232, "average_stars": 3.77, "yelping_since": "2013-06-03 05:04:10"}}

We arrived quite early on a Sunday and as a result had no problem getting a table.   (I had called ahead but there are no reservations.   However, the server indicated that before 10 or so there should not be a problem.)\n\nWe sat at one of the two marble tables near the window which was surprisingly warm for that day.   There is 1/2 booth-1/2 chair seating along the wall and mostly table seating in the rear (where there is limited natural light).   The place has that \"cool vibe\".   Black and white are the primary colors here with pictures of puppies along the wall in the front.\n\nThere are almost too many choices on the menu.  (I peeked before we came and still had problems choosing.)   One is better than the next.   On the breakfast all day, there is a mix of French and Middle Eastern (specifically Lebanese) influences.   We sipped coffee as we struggled with decision and this is the first time I knowingly drank LaColombe coffee.   It is rich and robust, and was very fresh.\n\nWe finally decided on the Croque Madame and the Parisian Za.    The latter was suggested by the server as it is one of their more popular selections.   This was overall a well balanced plate with a bit of fruit, a bit of salad, what was to be brioche but tasted like croissant with caramelized onion, ham, and goat cheese - I am a sucker for goat cheese - and two eggs over easy.    These eggs were perfectly cooked in butter with no signed of browning as a result of the eggs being dropped into an overheated pan.  Overall, this was  winner.  \n\nService was a bit overzealous.   We were asked at least 5 times by three different people how things were.   In the middle of the meal, a person we had yet to encounter decided to rearrange plates and cups for us (square plates do not work very well on small round tables).   Once, I get my plate or coffee cup, please don't touch it until I'm done with it.   It is a pet peeve of mine.  \n\nOnce we were done, we were asked if we wanted anything else.   Of course, the question was, \"What else do you have?\" after we had been sitting and staring a  dessert case of croissant, cookies, and mmmmmmmmmmmmmacarons.     The server started naming the flavors and we stopped her at salted caramel.   We each had one and these were the perfect foil for the coffee.\n\nBy this time the place was filled and we were getting that strong hint to leave.  I wanted to stop in the restroom before we left and as I walked to the rear a waitress, without my asking said, \"All the way in the back to the right.\"   I mention this only because as I approached the back of the place I saw these curtains framing an open area to the left and started moving in that direction only to find myself slamming into a floor to ceiling mirror.   The woman waiting to get into the single bathroom giggled, and said, \"I did the SAME thing the first time I was here.\"   So fellow Yelpers, watch out for the mirror all the way in the back on the left.\n\nWhen I arrived back at the table they had taken my dining partner's coffee cup, but I wasn't leaving mine behind.   Two quick gulps, and we were gone.\n\nThere is a sign posted to let you know that this is not the place to bring your laptop or iPad and work as you drink the great coffee.   Eat, pay, and go.  This is understandable but also very obvious.\n\nFood is 5 stars.  Service 4.\n\nParking here is challenging as this is strictly a residential neighborhood with plenty of residential garages and the driveways eliminate street parking at the driveway apron of the garage.  There is no commercial lot in sight.\n\nSo come with someone with a small car or be prepared to walk a bit, but it is definitely worth the effort.", "date": "2015-01-26 00:33:13", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 1470, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2011-07-16 13:51:50"}}
