I live in Center City and have for years. I'm a half-block away from this location and pop in 7-10 times a week. If you remember the place that was here before, The Coffee Bar, then you would know that this place is an upgrade. \n\nFirst, let's talk about how it is one of the very few places you can get quality Matcha tea in the area. For a big city like Philly, this is kinda sad. Also, the menu isn't built for people who want to sit down and eat 3 plates of bacon. Little Pete's, which is also amazing, is across the street for that. This menu has quinoa, avocado toast, eggs, granola, etc. They have a ton of gluten-free options as well. The coffee menu has flat whites, black and whites, long blacks, piccolos, etc. It is just very different than what is in Philly right now. And I think that is a good thing.\n\nThe ambiance is much better than before, too. The place is bright white and well-lit. When it first opened of course there were kinks to be worked out. That is everywhere. Federal Donuts, Double Knot, and other spots I've been to have all had hiccups when they started. For me, it was them running out of things I wanted to order. Since then it hasn't happened, and I'm guessing because they nailed down their sales. \n\nLastly, I have seen some complaining about price. And that's what compelled me to write this review. I assume that if you can leave a Yelp review, then you can look up prices online. Or better yet, on the menu when you're in the store. If you don't want to pay for organic avocado on gluten-free toast with an organic egg then don't do it. Again, you're paying for organic and gluten-free. It's not cheap anywhere. \n\nI think it's fitting that Bluestone Lane is situated between Parc and Little Pete's. Not cheap delicious diner food and not overly expensive French cuisine. Something in the middle. For those of us who live in the neighborhood, this option is not only welcome but much-needed.", "date": "2016-04-11 19:35:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 23, "average_stars": 4.3, "yelping_since": "2013-02-23 18:16:43"}}

The tall male behind the register, who is almost always behind the register, didn't acknowledge me at all. Then a female employee asked for a cup of ice, for herself, from across the room -- which he got for her. He slams the cup of ice down, then he looks to me, somewhat exasperated and says, \"What can I get you?\" I say, \"Hi, I'd like a small iced coffee\", and I pull my credit card out to pay. He said the price so quickly and quietly that I didn't hear him and asked him to repeat. He said $3.78 as he was filling a cup with ice for my coffee. Now, I have to admit,  I was a little shocked at that amount, this place has the ambiance of a chain, so I said, \"Ohhh.. no, I don't want that anymore. What do you ha ---\" Before I finished my sentence, he had already thrown the ice back into the bin, and stormed off! Like he was upset that I didn't want to pay $4 for a cup of iced coffee... [as a former barista, I know nobody reeeally wants to pay $4 for a cup of iced coffee, and that's ok - it's not a reflection on you - got it, dude?] I stood there, with my mouth literally open, credit card in hand, expecting him to return - which he didn't. I couldn't believe he had walked away as I was trying to order something else! Suffice it to say, I'll go to PS&Co or even Starbucks (gasp!) if I need coffee in the future.

It included cherry tomatoes, feta, avocado, sauteed kale, a poached egg and red quinoa.  I was impressed with the portion size, as I wasn't able to finish it - a big deal for a plate cleaner like me!  \n\nI thought this meal had a lot of good qualities and just a few areas of improvement.  All of these ingredients went very well together, so that you could take a bite of any two or three of them and it was a solid mix of flavors.  (It's a deconstructed bowl, so it's up to the diner to either mix it all together or to assemble individual bites throughout the meal.)  \n\nI will say that without the feta, there was no salt/seasoning in the dish, so each bite did need that component in order to taste complete.  The poached egg was also overcooked, but I'm not as deeply in love with runny eggs as everyone else seems to be, so it was alright with me.\n\nLastly, the staff and owner stay on top of quality improvement and I really do appreciate that.

After my previous review in regards to the piccolo coffee, I decided to give the food a try. I asked for vegemite + avocado smash. I asked for extra cherry tomatoes on top. The nice guys over the counter told me it came with cherry tomatoes. Did not say anywhere in the menu (under the toast section). And I pointed to what I wanted on the menu, not sure how that could be misleading. They asked if I wanted feta, I said no. They asked if I wanted tahini, because it comes with it. I thought tahini, feta, avocado together? That goes my macro allowance! (Just joking). I was worried and overwhelmed that my humble vegemite and avocado has turned out to be this gigantic monster spread. I gave it a go. I didn't complain, I'm no chef, I'm sure they know what they are doing. I got back to the hotel and I was gobsmacked! I had a piece of toast that was half vegemite on one side of the bread and tahini on the other, topped with very unriped avocado. For vegemite eaters, we know that we don't smack a lump of vegemite on bread, it is served sparingly with some sort of fat; butter more commonly or avocado. I was frustrated that I got a blob of Vegemite on one side and tahini on the other, ( you (can see the division on that piece of toast), it became inedible (I'm sorry if that sounds rude). \n\nThe thing is that I came to Bluestone to have my regular brunch fix to feel at home. Although I was happy to go somewhere else to have brunch, but when a cafe claimed to serve Vegemite and piccolo I expect them to do it correctly, I don't think that's a lot to ask. My suggestion, take off piccolo and call it Cortado, I'll accept that. Makes everything easier. I have given this place lots of tries at different times of the day but they failed to deliver. \n\nFor the 6 weeks I've been in downtown Philly, I have been having Americano and Cortados like a local and I don't mind it as it comes out exactly how it's suppose to. \n\nBelieve me, I was rooting for Bluestone.

Full disclosure, it was a lovely day outside, I was in no hurry, and I was happy to be meeting a friend to explore something new. So, I came with no expectations, plenty of time, and a generally positive mood. We sat for table service and got a menu with a pretty good selection of drinks on one side and food options on the other.\n\nIt was a bright, airy spot. Our servers were friendly and happy to answer questions. Yes, it's no cash, which they tell you in advance. It felt to me like the kind of place that takes its time and care with their food and drinks - it took longer than I'm used to, but I enjoyed the time to be present and mindful instead of rushing through it. I was facing the wall, so I don't have a sense of how busy or not it was.\n\nThe golden (turmeric) latte was amazing. Warm, spicy, a little sweetness, and a gorgeous golden color. I'm not a coffee drinker, so their other latte options (including matcha, beet, etc.) were super attractive to me. Plus I like the idea that they've got some fun healthy ingredient to add some pizzazz to my day. At first the size does seem small, but it was actually the perfect amount. Probably the best latte drink I've ever had. I assume, though, that you do have to like turmeric and that kind of savory spice =). Can't wait to try the matcha version next time.\n\nMy friend had the oats and yogurt. She raved about the lemon curd and asked for more. I had toast with avocado and vegemite. I've never met bread and avocado I didn't like, but I will say this toast was perfect - the type of thick, hearty toast that makes you happy you have bread in your life. And, a super significant portion of avocado. Vegemite was unexpected, but added a unique salty taste that paired well with the avocado (you only need a little!). Plus I got some good vitamin B! I only wanted a half portion (they give you two really big pieces of toast and - again- a ton of avocado), so I got a box for round 2 later today. \n\nLooking forward to coming back for another treat in the future.", "date": "2017-03-08 17:39:22", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 13, "average_stars": 4.43, "yelping_since": "2011-02-03 01:18:47"}}

I heard of them when I was in NYC but I was happy to see that they had some cafes in Philly! I would say this location is weird because it's actually connected to a hotel so bathroom access requires hotel key cards (which are provided by Bluestone) and the wifi is directly from the hotel (the wifi works fine btw). Upon entering, I was asked if I was dining in. I requested that I just wanted coffee and carried on with ordering a small latte. The barista was going to put it in a paper cup, but I requested to have the coffee in a cup since I was actually going to sit here for a while. The first thing I noticed about their latte is that the cup sizing is really small compared to other places I've checked out. The latte was served in a Gibraltar like cup, but I personally thought the latte small. Maybe not worth the almost $4 I paid for a latte. Taste of the drink was fine though.\n\nAnyways, the seating around this spot is nice. There is bar seating around the center as well as individual tables along the walls. Plugs are limited, but I was able to snatch one along the wall seating area. The employees are definitely friendly although there was this one HELLLLA  sassy person working. I think their system of being a caf\u00e9/coffee caf\u00e9 is confusing. One can either participate in the typical dine in experience where one sits down with a menu and orders food with a server etc, the other option is just to order coffee in the front and grab a place to chill. \n\nTheir dine in menu looks IG worthy and appetizing, but their prices are ridiculous in my opinion.

Then, it is piled high with \"avocado smash\" which is Bluestone Lane's special avocado mixture. YUM it is SO GOOD. It also has sunflower sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, and feta cheese.

Also, bonus points because it's nicely decorated with teal and white pillows on the seats for your back.\n\nI ordered the avocado smash (obviously) and a flat white. The flat white was exactly what I expected. It was piping hot with a nice design and had a kind of sweet, acidic taste which I liked.

I know a lot of other reviews on here commented about the wait but keep in mind, this cafe is brand-new and it seems like they've fixed the wait time problem already. Pretty great, if you'd ask me. \n\nAll in all, I gave 5/5 stars for the cute ambiance, amazing avocado toast, yummy coffee, great customer service, and that there was hardly any wait time at all.

It was not too crowded or noisy when I was there on a Saturday morning for breakfast -- which was 9-10 a.m. The breakfast food is creative and very good. At least it is my idea of a good breakfast that is not merely the standard eggs and bacon or pancakes and waffles. The wait staff are courteous and professional. \n\nIt is a restaurant, not just a caf\u00e9, so is not yet another Center City caf\u00e9 where you order coffee, pastries or a breakfast wrap from a limited menu at the counter and then find a bar stool or a catch-as-catch-can seat at a table. Though it has bar seating along a wall, it primarily seats customers at a number of individual two- and four-person tables where you are waited upon -- exactly what I was looking for to meet a friend for Saturday morning breakfast. \n\nMy only minor criticisms are that the boutique juices are pretty pricey (at around $10 for a glass), so I personally gave those a pass, and the decanters they serve the hot coffee in are literally too hot to touch. They look like little glass milk jars. My dining companion and I actually had to use our napkins to pour our coffees, so they need to find other coffee decanters to serve coffee. (Hint to the management: The waitstaff should offer to decant the first serving of coffee when it's brought to the table, in any case -- at least I think that would be more in line with the setting and level of service you are trying to offer.) However, I certainly won't detract any stars for these minor issues.\n\nThough the juices are pricey, the meals are very reasonable. My dining companion and I had breakfast and coffee for under $20 each, including tax and a 20% tip, which is a great value for a Center City breakfast spot that is this nice. \n\nThis restaurant connects directly to the Warwick Hotel building which provides an interior entrance to the restaurant, so exiting the restaurant down that hallway leads to the restrooms, which are equally tasteful and very clean, always a telling attribute of any establishment. \n\nI hope the management and staff keep up the good work because, at least as of the date of this review, if you're wanting a nice place for breakfast or brunch I definitely recommend Bluestone Lane.

The plating sure looks nice, but the portion is unbelievably tiny. Almost every single dish on the menu that is savory contains sheep milk's feta. As I don't eat sheep/goat dairy products, I requested to substitute the cheese to any thing else, but I was told that they do not have any other cheese and could only remove the cheese completely from the dish. I decided to ordered the green baked eggs without feta in the end. It was such a bad choice - without any cheese, the dish did not even have any flavor. There was two eggs that were cooked through, and some unseasoned spinach at the bottom. No flavor at all. \n\nCoffee - you would think the coffee here will taste good since it's a coffee shop after all. Latte for $3.5 is tiny. The coffee is mediocre and tastes bland. They do not offer free refill for regular coffee even if you're eating in. \n \nEnvironment - the place is actually a good study spot, although I did not find any outlets but it has WiFi. It's also very quiet, and almost empty on a Sunday afternoon. \n\nService - I might be already biased when the server told me that they could not substitute feta, but I was further surprised about the poor service during my meal. Right after my food is served and I started eating, the server came by to sweep the floor right next to me three times. I did not get a picture when she was right next to me, but the two pictures shows when she was sweeping nearby. On her fourth visit to my table, she asked me how my food was while holding the broomstick in her hand. \n\nAfter I finished the food, I left for another coffee shop to continue my work. I don't think there's any reason for me to come back.", "date": "2019-09-11 20:09:27", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 26, "average_stars": 4.12, "yelping_since": "2015-06-27 17:08:57"}}

Located inside the Warwick Rittenhouse Hotel, the cafe is spacious with indoor and outdoor seating available. I love the clean, minimalist aesthetic of the cafe. Every table has a QR code that pulls up their menu and ordering site so you can order and pay directly on your phone. The menu is health focused with a lot of nutritiously balanced dishes full of greens, proteins, and carbs. Although their food menu is not large, everything looks really good and in reality the food also taste good. Definitely one of the few foods healthy foods that I've had that also taste good Their drinks menu on the other hand is quite extensive and similarly, they all look good too. Price wise, everything was very reasonable. \n\n*BREAKFAST*\nBeet latte - the name says it all. It  was my first time trying a beet drink of any sorts and you can definitely taste the beets in this. It taste pretty good.\n\nGreen baked eggs - Shakshuka-style baked eggs dished. Although it came out in a relatively small cast iron, this dish was filling. The chimichurri made the dish quite flavorful, not bland at all. I love the runny over easy style eggs. Solid mix of greens, proteins and carbs. \n\n*VERDICT*\nI would definitely come back again. Great place for healthy conscious eating", "date": "2021-05-19 19:40:49", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 94, "average_stars": 3.95, "yelping_since": "2017-05-31 01:01:54"}}

It had variety of breakfast  selections that other places at times do not offer.  \n\nWe ordered some food dishes and 1 hot chocolate, 1 coffee and 1 cortado, and we were served with avocado bowl first.  Then only 1 coffee arrived.  We sat for 15 minutes more as I did not get my coffee.  When I brought this up to my waiter, he became agitated and told us that there was problem in the kitchen, but what did it have to do with cortado? Not sure.  He wanted to comp for the inconvenience of cortado brought in  so late and stormed off when he was suggested that drinks should arrive together and before the food.  He them never came back to  check up on us.  All poached eggs were raw and undercooked, and my husband asked to replace it, but another waitress promised to replace it, but never did.  \n\nAs I walked to see if they had any baked goods, the same waitress started to show me directions to the bathroom, which I never asked.  She seemed tuned out and disconnected and then realized that she was talking to the wrong person when I looked at her in my dismay because I never asked her where the bathroom was.  This same waitress was also asked to bring butter, but she just ignored it or was just spaced out.  \n\nA side note, our waiter was also arguing with another customer and they were both agitated.  \n\nThe drip coffee was good, but the cortado had too much milk. \n\nThe staff seemed apathetic, dismissive, rude and overwhelmed.  When we asked the spaced out waitress if she was overwhelmed, she responded that she wasn't, yet she never brought our butter, our eggs, never acknowledged our feedback, did apologize, and we were never comped the coffee ad promised.\n\nSome suggestions to the owners:\nPlease train your staff on customer service and have more supervision on site.  This place really needs a manager.", "date": "2020-01-26 17:28:43", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 35, "average_stars": 2.96, "yelping_since": "2016-03-18 18:51:49"}}

I wanted to like this place because the location is great, space is cute, and provides a great healthy brunch option. However, the food is simply underwhelming. \n\nOrdered a rainbow bowl which consisted of a colorful arrangement of veggies (spinach, corn, avocado, quinoa, etc) and a side of yogurt tahini as well as a chicken sandwich. The rainbow bowl was filling because of the quinoa and avocado, but definitely lack flavor and certain items seemed to be an afterthought. For example, there were 2 pieces of feta cheese in the whole dish - not enough to actually give it any flavor profile, but still there. The chicken sandwich was probably the greatest disappointment as it was extremely bland in flavor. It was lacking some citrus to make the flavors stand out. \n\nI also ordered the matcha latte which was also lacking in match flavor and had chunks of powder towards the bottom. And it came at a hefty cost of $5.40. \n\nIf you want a healthy option and are okay with spending a little more, it's not a bad option to try.

Went in after a night of *maybe* too much drinking, and the breakfast sandwiches and ricotta toast were exactly what we needed. Absolutely no complaints about the food.\n\nOur waiter was super nice, and we had a kind of funny interaction. I was feeling a little, let's say, queasy from the previous night's drinking and inquired as to whether they had ginger ale. He said, \"We don't carry soda, we prefer to stick to the healthier side here.\" My husband proceeds to order a coffee off the menu that is literally just coffee with two scoops of ice cream in it. Unfortunately the ice cream was actually out, so my husband had to miss out on this healthy treat. :)\n\nI personally didn't really like the iced coffee we both ended up having, but again the food was great. Service was good too, pretty quick even though the place started filling up after we sat down.\n\nIt's also a little pricey for what it is, but that's true of a lot of the places we checked out in this area.\n\nOverall I recommend it(especially if you're staying at the attached hotel, can't beat the convenience), but if you want something with better coffee and a larger selection and have a little extra time, I might suggest walking over to Plenty Cafe instead.", "date": "2018-08-26 16:18:45", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 152, "average_stars": 3.77, "yelping_since": "2013-05-07 14:22:03"}}

The service model is horrendous. On the many times I have stopped in on my morning commute (between 7:30am-8:30am), the order of operations behind the coffee bar has been clunky and slow for those of us ordering coffee to-go. I deliberately choose cold brew, regular coffee, or a juice (vs. espresso drinks which take longer) when I'm in a hurry. The person who takes orders also fulfills simple coffee orders AND serves the sit-down area in the back. This means that when there are 1 or more people waiting at the cashier, they are waiting for more than 5 minutes to even put their coffee order in and pay. Then they wait another 10 minutes for their cold brew to appear on the other side of the counter! In addition, the cashier doesn't even acknowledge the people waiting in line with a \"I'll be right with you.\" The pace of the staff is almost slow motion. The last two times I tried getting a coffee here, I gave up without being able to place an order.\n\nThis may be an okay place to visit if you're staying at the hotel and have no immediate plans, but it's not worth wasting your time if you hope to get in and out in less than 15 minutes (which is crazy for something as simple as coffee).", "date": "2019-11-05 17:37:31", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 28, "average_stars": 4.21, "yelping_since": "2014-01-12 04:33:48"}}

I waited to be seated, waiter told me to feel free to sit anywhere. I sat at a small table since it was just me and was trying to be considerate of other larger parties that might come. \nThe waiter brought me a menu and after a few minutes asked me if I wanted anything to drink...yep. I wanted a latte. Then he just took away the menu before I could say anything else. \"Excuse me, in sorry, but could i get back the menu to have a look at your lunch options?\" I felt bad because he was clearly embarrassed. I eventually went with the avocado smash with prosciutto...I would say, skip the prosciutto, definitely not worth the extra $4 here. Although it was only one slice of bread with avocado on top, it was quite filling and the tomatoes were fresh and lovely. \n\nI am not sure what happened to the staff during my meal but it seemed like everyone disappeared except the cashier. No one came to check on me during my meal or after. No one came to ask if I needed anything else (I really did want some dessert). In the end I just got up, put my menu in a tray where I saw some others and went to cashier to pay for my meal. Maybe this is just how it is here, you're sort of left alone after they bring the food but I wasn't expecting it. So awkward. \n\nOtherwise, my latte was great and the vibe of this place is nice (the modern low pop music is a plus).

I paid over $4.50 for a large hot tea, and that is too steep, pun intended.  I think for that price, I'll stick with my Starbucks tea for about $3, and at other cafes, I am never given a hard time about double cupping or a beverage sleeve, like I often am here.  For $4.50, I would appreciate more friendly service.  \n\nAgain, I really do like the idea of this cafe, it seems nice and cute, and I would like to go there, relax, read a book, but I hardly ever feel that it's inviting or warm.  \n\nI feel that yesterday a situation left me upset.  I knew what I wanted to order, and I kept waiting to order, the people ahead of me couldn't decide and kept thinking about what they wanted.  I was in a hurry to an appointment and I finally said, \"I know what I want, I'm ready to order\"- the manager said \"well there's a line\" and I feel like by keeping me waiting, that could have been handled better, if someone else took my order, but alas, the service was slow again...\n\nI hope that they can hire more people and that they can have a better, more efficient customer service experience.
