Again, being loaded onto a super fresh French loaf with the right amount of veggies was the perfect sandwich. \n\nThe prices are also very reasonable, as they should be. I've seen a few places offering a banh mi for close to $10, no way jose! I think the bbq beef was $6.95 and the traditional was $4.95. Seriously can't beat it!

They have a great little coffee shop that would probably survive on its own. Then they add Bahn Mi because why not. They open at 7am and I am usually here around then to grab coffee before work.\n\nFor my own taste, I am not a huge fan of their coffee. I typically get a black drip dark roast and there is just something about that taste that I usually find off. Why do they get 5 Stars you ask? Their Bahn Mi, plain and simple. It is some of the best Bahn Mi I have had in the US and perfectly prepared on the right bread without too many ingredients.\n\nAt breakfast, you can even get egg sandwiches on their Bahn Mi buns - which is a real treat. They also have a pretty wide assortment of baked goods in the morning. There is something for everyone.\n\nI'm not sure why I keep pay $5 for coffee I don't really like. Maybe it's convenience. Maybe it's the atmosphere. Maybe I like supporting a local small business. It's probably a healthy mix of all three.
