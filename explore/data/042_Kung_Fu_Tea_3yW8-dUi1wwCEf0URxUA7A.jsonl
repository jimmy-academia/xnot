Sounded strange, but OK I can live with that. When I got my drink, it was super thick. UGH! Not the light liquidy milk tea I am use to. I think they probably got the ratio of creamer to tea wrong. The tea left a gritty film in my mouth. Not to mention, there were way too much boba in my drink. I love boba, but there has to be a good tea-to-boba balance so I don't spend all my time chewing. Half my drink was filled with boba and the boba was a bit too mushy for my taste. Aside from the milk+boba issue, my husband ordered the longan honey tea with grass jelly and boba.

Last time the toppings were in jars so that customers could see and taste test what they were. Also, there was very limited options in toppings. Unlike Teado, they don't offer a lot of options for jellies. My favorite jellies are mango and lychee which they didn't have but other places I've been to like Teado and SnoCream (see review) did. What I did like was the amount of options they gave you in terms of customizing your order. They have a specific scale on how much ice you want and how much sugar/sweetness you wanted. This is very helpful for those picky customers like me. In terms of flavor, I got the coconut milk tea with boba and my friend got the regular milk tea with boba. The tapioca bobas were al dente, not too mushy and not too hard. The flavor was also good for both drinks. They also had a good variety of flavors but what I wish they would elaborate on their menus what was in each drink like flavors and toppings etc. The cashier was very helpful and tentative of our orders and they came out correctly. The atmosphere is very modern, like Teado, and they had a good seating layout with booths in the back of the room. They also had options for snacks which I didn't try but would like to in the future.

Boba tea just felt right to us, even though it was a chilly day. I personally wanted to come here to try the macarons because I had my heart set on those yummy pastries for dessert. \n\nAtmosphere:\nOne of the more spacious boba tea shops in Chinatown. When I first walked in, it looked like it would be a trendy bar in the city except that they sell boba tea and bakery goods. The place was clean and also relatively empty because it was midday. The lighting is different in different areas of the shop. There are black lights in some areas while other areas have dim lighting for playing games like Jenga or Uno. Overall, the place is dimly lit for a boba tea shop, but I am pretty sure it was their intention to create this certain ambiance. \n\nFood/Drinks:\nMy friends ordered coconut milk tea and KF oolong tea while I ordered the pumpkin oolong milk tea. I like boba tea shops that allow customers to customize the sweetness levels of the drinks. We all ordered the drinks with full sugar and it wasn't over sweet. My first friend ordered her drink and a tiramisu to go. Like me, my second friend wanted macarons too so she ordered 6 macarons: rose, matcha, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, and raspberry. I only got 2 macarons (pistachio and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) because they were $2.50 each. They were a bit sweet for my liking but I still ate them both. Also, I am confused as to why the macarons aren't advertised well. The price of the macarons are clearly posted on a make shift sign in big font. Yet, the flavors of the macarons are posted in small font on the side of the metal bar frame on an even smaller make shift sign. Wouldn't it make sense to print a big make shift sign of the available flavors and it posted right next to the make shift sign with the price?? And also possibly label each flavor on the shelves where people can clearly read them accordingly?\n\nPrice: \nAs I mentioned before, the macarons were $2.50 each. The price of boba tea here is typical of boba tea shops (between $2.50-$4 for medium size) so it's relatively in expensive. However, they do charge 50 cents extra for boba, which I personally do not like. I have been to many successful boba tea shops that do not have to charge extra for boba and they are the places I always go back to. I can understand charging extra for extra toppings, but bobas should be universally served at no charge. It seems to be the trend for getting boba tea shops in Chinatown Philly. I also found it odd that the cashier put the macarons in a cup. Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. \n\nService:\nThe staff seems friendly but a bit offstandish. I understand it was the middle of the day, but the cashier who was taking orders didn't seem to care about servicing customers in a timely order. When my friend was ordering her macarons, the cashier rudely cut her off mid sentence and asked how many she was getting. After she took her drink order and order for macarons, she put the macarons in a boba tea cup and walked away to seal the cup. When she came back, she was just standing there purposely not taking my order even though I was clearly ready to order. i just stood there and stared at her for 30 seconds until she looked up from doing nothing but ignoring me. she then replied \"next\" as if I weren't standing there the whole time waiting to order.  No greeting at all preceding her \"what are you getting\" comment. So, I told her \"Can I get a  medium pumpkin oolong milk tea with full sug....\" when she rudely cut me off and told me my total. So, I promptly tell her \"I'm not done yet. I also want 2 macarons - 1 pistachio and 1 creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\" She tells me my new total and walks away with my cup of macarons to seal it while another lady who was standing near by tenders my cash. \n\nIt's a good thing i know how to make my own boba tea at home.

Seems like a sweet deal but don't be fooled. My sisters and I came here to find out if it was worth all the hype. Long story short: it wasn't. \n\nThe staff at Kung Fu Tea was curt and less-than-friendly, which is not my normal experience with bubble tea places. It was likely due to the volume but I would hope the staff could handle it since it seems like a popular place. Needless to say, I overestimated them. \n\nThe cashier girl was terrible at explaining herself, leading to our purchase of 5 drinks for the price of three. Our original intention was to buy four for the price of two (even numbers are clearly the key here) but she charged us for 3 and \"gave us the fifth free.\" That makes very little sense to me as the second and fourth should've been free and a third drink should never have been added to the tab in the first place. \n\n3 customers who paid after we did got their tea before we did and of the five drinks, two were made incorrectly. One had extra lychee jelly, when we specifically asked for just bubbles and one had no bubbles at all! A sixty percent success rate isn't very satisfying. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager but was denied. Of course, we left irritated. \n\nWould I recommend this place? Maybe, on a regular business day.

I want to give this place a higher rating because they are 1 of only 2 places in Chinatown that serve winter melon tea. Unfortunately, they are just not consistent enough.\n\nI ordered other drinks here before but they were all forgettable. I literally don't remember what i ordered from here because it wasn't particularly good. I think i got stuff from the marketing materials on their walls. I recently went and ordered a cold winter melon tea with cream on top (thought it was salt foam). It was whack. It just tasted like milk and no tea flavor. When I order my regular winter melon tea (hot or cold) i ask \"no sugar\". Some employees say ok, while others say you need at least 50%. I dunno who is right or wrong. Some employees make it well, while others make it taste like sugar water. I always beat myself up if the drink comes out overly sweet or with no tea flavor at all. It's pricey for just premixed tea!!! I usually skip the bubbles or jelly because i'm poor and can't afford the up charge of .50 cents. I hate to compare, but toppings are FREE in NYC! And its like $1-2 cheaper for the same drink! LOL. It cost me $2 for a large winter melon tea with bubbles in NYC but $4 for same drink (which is made incorrectly). \n\nI'm trying to cut back on coffee so i replace it with tea.

I've tried all the other bubble tea places in Chinatown (Rising Tide, Tea Magic, Tea Do, Tea Talk, etc) and this place is the best! \n\n\nPros:\n--Extensive menu\n--Genuine tea taste, all milk teas actually taste like the real tea + milk!\n--Their drinks are not too sweet\n--The bubbles in their bubble tea are the right size and the right chewiness\n--All their milk teas (not just the wow milk) are lactose free! I'm lactose intolerant like a lot of people of Asian decent so I love that their milk teas tastes genuinely like milk yet won't make me miserable later. Other places have lactose free drinks, too, but I think they use cheap non-dairy substitute like coffee mate. \n--They seal their cups with plastic making them easy to transport.\n\nCons:\n--The sugar level in their drinks are supposedly adjustable but every time I tell them \"half-sugar\", they either tell me they don't adjust the sugar level in their milk teas or they say \"okay\" and the drink ends up tasting like normal.\n--$5 minimum for card is kinda inconvenient. This pretty much forces you to either get a large, buy for your friend, or go get cash from the shady ATM across the street.\n--They run out of ingredients if you go after 7pm! Once they had no bubble left, another day no matcha left. Maybe it will get better once the hype dies down. They did just open and all the Asians are flocking to this place!\n\nItems to avoid:\n--Matcha red bean slush. It's too sweet, and I don't think sugar level is adjustable for that! \n-- Gourd tea. My friend ordered this and it tastes like that Yeo'n gourd drink from a can! This is not tea at all, more like gourd sugar water. \n--Wow milk. The classic or oolong milk tea is much better than the wow milk! The wow milk taste like milk tea with a caramel/brown sugar added. It's not tea, it's not coffee. My friend likes the wow milk but I didn't care for it.

I go here every week if not every other day, and it's consistently great. It's a popular spot to socialize or just to grab a refreshing drink! Like most tea places, they allow you to customize sugar and ice levels, making sure that your drink is what you want. Just be warned, they sometimes don't take credit due to some cap. \n\nHaving been here so many times, I've tried many of their options. The staple drink I get is the Yogurt Lemonade, a lighter supplement to milk tea. It's a blend of lemonade with an asian yogurt drink, definitely worth trying. An even healthier alternative would be the Yogurt Orange; however, they run out of those a lot. \n\nWith milk tea's, I usually opt for the Kung Fu Milk Tea. It's definitely their classic drink, and it never seems to disappoint. I even get two sometimes a night, but I would recommend one as it feels a bit heavy after finishing a large. I've also tried their almond milk tea, which is a bit on the sweeter side. These drinks are definitely great, and they're consistently made well every time. If you plan on saving your drink for later, be sure to get no ice and no boba. I tend to get no ice either way as it leaves more space for the actual drink!\n\nService here is great. They only not operate the store efficiently, but they take good care of the place too. There have been many times I've seen customers leave cups behind, but the workers do a diligent job cleaning up after. I've even witnessed an employee shoveling snow and ice from the front to ensure no one gets injured.
