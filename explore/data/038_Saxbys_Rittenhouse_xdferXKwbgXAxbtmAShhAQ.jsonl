It's so hard to find places these days that make eggs fresh on the grill and so I love that this place takes the time to make their sandwiches to perfection. Though it takes some time, it's well worth the wait. I usually get their veggie egg white and cheese on multigrain and it always hits the spot...fluffy eggs, fresh veggies, and toasted bread..yum. Depending on who makes it, they sometimes even add fresh spinach or cilantro to the mix. \n\nTheir salads and lunch sandwiches are equally as satisfying. Their coffee and drinks are just mediocre though - I ordered a French Vanilla latte once that had way too much syrup in it and once I got my iced coffee without any ice in it. I already have a soft spot for this place though so forgive the employees for these mishaps since they are so willing to fix them. \n\nMy favorite part of this place? The windows. When I walk by their huge open windows it literally draws me to them and makes me want to bring all my work and sit by them for hours and enjoy the Rittenhouse crowd...and yes I have done that on more than one occasion.

Great thing about this place is they have a real grill and use real eggs, not the processed egg patty.  Both the veggie sandwiches were pretty good, but interestingly had different types of veggies in each sandwich.  I'm not sure how they decided to include spinach in one and not the other.  My girlfriend said that last time she came the veggies were actually in the egg and not outside so it really depended on who made the sandwich.  \n\nThe place lacks consistency from what I could tell, but even their inconsistency made for a pretty good breakfast sandwich.

I arrived there having to use the bathroom very badly, and explained that I was going to order something, but I just had to use the bathroom first. But, they said they had just given the key to someone else. So I made the mistake of spending $4.50 on a smoothie and waited for 5 minutes, having to go even more. Then I walked back to knock on the door, and I realized that there were 2 bathrooms. But, the other one was also locked, so I assumed that one was also occupied and the key was taken.\n\nAnother five minutes passed. Finally, someone who appeared to not have a home (really I have no hate for Philadelphia's homeless population, I understand they are marginalized and also have to use the bathroom) and a woman who appeared to have all of her worldly possessions with her in the bathroom finally emerged. When I walked inside, I thought I was going to be sick, because it had one of the worst smells I have ever smelled in my entire life. This is also circumstantial, and not really Saxby's fault.\n\nThe reaction of the two employees working then was entirely Saxby's fault. They were incredibly rude to me when I requested to use the other locked bathroom, which at that point was apparently empty. One of them finally agreed to unlock it for me (why did only he have a key and why was it not available to customers?) \n\nSo I walked into the second bathroom, and it was also ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING ALSO, and smelled almost as bad as the first. It didn't even have any soap. This was particularly disturbing because this bathroom IS ONLY USED BY STAFF, WHO PREPARE OUR FOOD, WHICH INCLUDES THINGS LIKE EGG WHITE SANDWICHES THEY MAKE ON PREMISE.\n\nNeither employee apologized to me for my wait, nor tried to expedite my ten-minute waiting process. In fact, the idea that one of their customers wanted to use one of their bathrooms but needed a key to access it seemed like a huge inconvenience to them. Later, when I tried to do my work, I saw both employees diligently wipe down tables and clean up cups, but not go anywhere near the bathrooms.\n\nSo according to other reviews, the manager of this Saxby's reads Yelp.

I don't order anything special (just a coffee or americano) so there really isn't much to screw up. The place is designed well. There are some computers at one side that seem to be popular. There is ample seating and there are plenty of outlets.\n\nOne of the things I like about this Saxbys is their choice of seating. They have a ton of bar space along the walls, so you bring your laptop and not take up a whole table. They have a bunch of tables, so you can bring your laptop and take up a whole table. They also have a big community table so you can spread all of your work all over the table - well, this is more suitable for study groups - but I love the idea of striking up a conversation at the community table, not that I would, but I love the idea.\n\nToward the end of my visit, I realized my phone was about to die and I didn't bring my charger - another awesome move by this place - they have a charger station against the wall, so I could hook my phone up to it, sit at a table staring at it while it charges, and grab it when it's done, really thoughtful, though.", "date": "2012-12-21 16:22:26", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 168, "average_stars": 3.55, "yelping_since": "2010-03-15 23:15:51"}}

I purchased an overnight oats (the only vegan option) from the app that lists the ingredients as being clean and good (pictured below). As I was more than halfway done with my oats I was beyond horrified to learn that the cranberry sauce contains not only corn syrup but HIGH FRUCTOSE corn syrup, essentially complete poison for the body. This is extremely disappointing as a local company that prides itself on having better food/drink options than your average Starbucks would be okay with putting high fructose corn syrup in their items. I shared my findings with a few of my coworkers who too love Saxbys and everyone was appalled to learn this. As staple American brands (such as Kelloggs and Quaker) are proudly advertising having no corn syrup in their items, I highly advise Saxbys to do the same.", "date": "2020-03-04 14:43:26", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 9, "average_stars": 3.9, "yelping_since": "2019-03-18 19:24:16"}}

So when a friend of mine suggested we meet there for coffee based on the fact that they have high chairs (she had her one year old in tow), I was down with the plan. I arrived moments after my girlfriend accidentally left the key to the bathroom in the now-locked bathroom. As I ordered our coffees, she apologetically told the cashier that she had done this and asked if they had another key. The cashier made a few unnecessary remarks about the fact that the door locks automatically and that's why they have keys. Thanks, genius. Regardless, the key was left in there by mistake, my friend was apologetic, and then she was subjected to some embarrassment handed down from the cashier. In the end, a large handful of extra bathroom keys was brought out and we got the door open. It didn't have to be a big deal but the entire experience was really off-putting. \n\nI went over to the creamer station (still in the same congested location as before), and literally had to swat away fruit flies while grabbing my sweetener and getting away from there as fast as possible. Obviously, something isn't getting cleaned properly and no one is doing a thing about it. \n\nThis was my second visit to Saxbys and also my last.", "date": "2012-03-08 15:15:20", "useful": 16, "funny": 4, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 2256, "average_stars": 4.05, "yelping_since": "2008-03-28 13:26:38"}}

For me, I would love to try their indoor seatings in the future, but for right now, it is strictly in-and-out thing. \n\nI'm really starting to think the workers are a bunch of slowpoke and slowbro( just a note: slowpoke and slowbro are Pokemon characters that are extremely SLOW)behind the counter. There is at least 4 or more slowbro working but my drinks take a while. For instance, if I walk in and order, drinks take at least 10 minutes. Once I found out about their mobile ordering, I decided to order through that instead. Say if I order at 10:25, it says it will be ready at 10:36, when I arrived at 10:37, I waited additional 5 minutes. And is not like I order bunch of things, it is just 1 freaking drink smh.\n\nAs far as food wise. I think their coffees and drinks were pretty good. The fact that they offer oats milk is definitely a plus too. I fell in love with their Matcha drinks, my favorites are Big Mood and Vanilla Love. Almond Croissant is also another of my favorite, so flaky,crispy, and buttery.", "date": "2019-10-16 18:00:16", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 219, "average_stars": 3.71, "yelping_since": "2011-07-20 19:19:07"}}

After spending years in Europe i learned that being hip is not the best way to make a good cup of coffee. \n\nFirst, their coffee flavored coffee (a rare find nowadays) is sub-par and often watery and over-heated to disguise the flavor under a veil of burnt tongue. \n\nOkay, so you have fancy iPads. All that does is make the customers MORE antisocial. There's hardly anybody to talk to because they're playing with apps. \n\nSpeaking of antisocial, the barrista (as in a female bartender...why that title goes to a MALE employee....I dunno), Danny(?) or Dave(?) or Dennis(?), never once made eye contact. I had to let him know my order was ready because he was TEXTING behind the counter, and I had to wait almost 10 minutes before that becasue it seemed as if the two men behind the counter weren't really trained in how to serve a customer let alone interact with one...and there was only one person in front of me and it appeared to be his girlfriend...real professional.\n\nOVERALL: Get a trained and competent staff, make simpler drinks that don't have to be mixed with flavor so that they just become flavor concealing coffee, and the prices could be better for the watery and indistinguishable sweet things they offer.", "date": "2011-07-07 21:47:41", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 2.0, "yelping_since": "2011-07-07 21:44:53"}}
