Ultimately, it's a very mediocre brew and the food is even less fulfilling, considering the price, than a Cosi (and what could be more underwhelming than Cosi?). Given the number of colleges and hence, students in the area, you'd think better options would be available for a coffee and a place to sit.

It needs some healthy competition, we all do, so that the quality of service and menu will overcome its many shortcomings. \n\nAlso, note Kristine d.'s review of their sketchy credit and/or debit card payments.

Let me share you the reasons I feel this way:\n\n(1) The wireless is reliable, even when the place is packed with Penn students.  Part of the reason is that it is within range of the Penn wireless, so the students don't overload the store's wireless.\n\n(2) There is lots of seating.  Even when it's busy, I'm usually able to find a seat...and if it's not busy, I have no trouble finding a seat within range of an outlet, if I want to use my laptop.\n\n(3) Lively, but professional decor.  Not as corporate as Starbucks but a lot sleeker than most of the other coffee shops around the area.\n\n(4) They sell bananas.  I like that.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I find annoying about this place:\n\n(1) No mugs, only disposable cups.  I find this is a huge omission.  I love drinking from a ceramic mugs.  Saxby's does use biodegradable, compostable cups, which is great. (They do not draw enough attention to this fact, IMHO), but I still really love having a ceramic mug to drink from.  If you want one here, you need to bring your own.\n\n(2) This place only gives one tea bag when you get a large.  Some Saxby's give two even for a medium tea.  I find this to be a bit cheap, and it's a major factor in me being less enthusiastic about coming here.\n\n(3) The baked goods and food...it's not really all that amazing, and kinda overpriced for what it is.  A number of the other coffee shops around have really top-notch food for similar prices.\n\nAll this said?  My complaints are minor, I like this place a lot.

I don't know where the store gets its coffee beans, but its black coffee tastes terrible and is always lukewarm - the storepersons probably never brew a new batch throughout the course of the day.\n\nThe iced \"Frolattes,\" as they call them, reminiscent of Starbucks' Frappuccinos, aren't half-bad but they're slightly more expensive.  The sweets (cakes, marble brownies) aren't too appetizing and the sandwiches have probably been sitting there the whole day as well (and I saw a fly behind the glass window, but I'm not going to be too harsh about that since the fly problem is unavoidable around here).  \n\nI go here because it's closer to where I live and because there are more empty tables here than in Starbucks.

Despite all of the other negative reviews, I actually don't mind this place at all. I mean, it's not the best coffee shop in Philly by any means, but it does what it's supposed to do. \n\nI started coming here this summer, as it's super close to where I work and just a few blocks away from my new apartment. Therefore, I haven't experienced slow service or seen this place too busy or packed. However, I can see how others could have experienced slow service during the school year when Penn students are all back on campus. Luckily, I haven't experienced any rude service from the workers here either. They have been decent to me all the times that I have come in. I usually get the soy latte or a strawberry-banana smoothie. I even ask them to throw in some mangos and they have always been more than willing to do so, which is really nice. \n\nThe chairs and tables are pretty old and worn out, as others have pointed out, however, I don't think it's too big of a deal if they're still usable. This is a good place to study and I like to come here to get work done. The wifi IS free...there are some yelpers who say it isn't and I have no idea what they're talking about because I am neither a Penn student nor have an Xfinity account and I still have access to Internet. There is a lot of space and seats available, although I wish this place could have more outlets. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to others for meeting up with friends or for studying and doing work.

Every time I'm in here, I feel like I've seen it all. And then somehow Saxby's manages to top themselves with something even more disappointing than the time before. Highlights from this week: Curdled creamer (nothing like seeing solid in your coffee), eggs not cooked all the way through, warm yogurt parfaits. \n\nThe coffee: Signature tastes pretty much like bitter water. Occasionally tastes good but I generally avoid. If you're looking for coffee with taste, stick to dark. That isn't to say that it's particularly good tasting, but it's a step up from signature. The flavored coffee is variable. Sometimes it's great, other times it can make you want to vomit. I don't bother with specialty drinks because of the prep time and poor service\n\nThe food: The breakfast sandwiches are bearable but given the service I never order them. Very poorly put together and fall apart as soon as you pick them up. Bacon was pretty bad last time I had it. The muffins are too sweet but edible. The bananas are never in the proper state of ripeness. They're either christmas-tree green or they look like they have leprosy. I really wish they would actually put the cream cheese on the bagel when they make it. To charge an extra dollar for 2 packets of cream cheese and then just give it to you is embarrassing. I'd be willing to do it myself if it didn't cost extra. Bagels are seldom any more toasted than lukewarm. Parfaits are typically left in the front for days on end and as such get warm/soggy after the first day and are disgusting thereafter. The frozen yogurt is actually pretty good most of the time. Lunch sandwiches are unremarkable and somewhat bland. I don't think they're as \"Artisan\" as their menu claims. Generally speaking, everything is a bit too expensive for the quality offered. \n\nAmbience: The size of the space is great. However, about a third of the tables are coming loose and falling apart and having spilled my coffee several times from the unbalanced tables, I know now to test every table before sitting there. There are entirely too few outlets for the amount of kids that come here to study. It turns into a jungle of overextended power cables by midday during finals. There are about 5 tables that people will kill for because of outlet proximity. I remember seeing something about Saxby's taking out outlets because of the tripping hazard but this has likely exacerbated it. The music is absolutely atrocious. I despise it. This very well may be my least favorite part of the Saxby's experience. The acoustic channel plays the same 5 songs over and over and over and they're all awful. Totally unbearable. Put the crooner channel or jazz standards channel or even the country channel on. Anything is better than this. With that said, there's usually enough space for me to find a table, which is nice. Couch seating area isn't bad either. However, I hate it when the banks/consulting firms take up 5-6 tables for their coffee chats. I can't comment on sanitation-- I've never seen a mouse or an insect in here so I assume it's good. Wifi is always functional but I usually stick to the Penn internet because my computer defaults to it. \n\nThe Staff: I apologize in advance for anything that may come across as gratuitous vitriol. In a word, incompetent. Just yesterday I attempted to buy a bottle of soda during a low-volume time of day. There were 3 people in front of me in line. It took 15 minutes. Are you kidding me? They are consistently bad. The only exception here is the Asian man whose name escapes me at the moment. It should not take 10 minutes to put a bagel in the inefficient toaster there and put it in tin foil and hand it to me. There's really no excuse, especially since they refuse to butter/put cream cheese on. About half the staff speaks minimal english, making ordering rather difficult. The ordering area at the front tends to go unstaffed for minutes at a time. Organizationally flawed beyond comparison. Prep time is prohibitively long and as a result I won't order anything requiring more than basic preparations. They seem to be understaffed at critical times and overstaffed during downtime. None are particularly friendly or seem to care that much. \n\n\nNonetheless, I am here almost every day. In the end, it's functional and I haven't gotten food poisoning yet. The convenience factor of living two blocks away is indisputable. Moreover, it's cheaper and bigger than Metropolitan and  has wifi, a major shortcoming of metro. I know what to expect when I'm there and so I'm very seldom surprised by the shortcomings I encounter.

I'll post it here:\n\n I went in for my regular drink (which I pretty much get everyday, Monday through Friday) which is a Nutty Irishman Frolatte. This morning, I noticed it was taking a while to make my drink (at least 10 minutes) but I come here so often and have a frequent Go Card that I figured they were a little behind. When the woman handed me my drink, I immediately noticed there was no coffee in it (it was just blended ice and milk) so I informed her (in case she was training or new) that this drink wasn't right and that it normally comes with coffee. Her response was \"oh, you have to ask for it\" to which I promptly informed her, that \"no, I order this drink every single day and it always comes with coffee.\" Why else would it be called a fro-latte? Attitude aside, she said she would fix. However, what I watched was her basically pour hot espresso onto the top of the milk/ice combination she had made me, and handed it back. It was not blended, mostly warm now, and tasted pretty awful.\n\n I tried to inform her again, or any other employee standing by, that this wasn't right and I was immediately ignored. Finally, after 10 minutes of standing there with my messed up drink that I had already paid for--the gentleman who works there (i'm not sure his name, but I believe he is of Asian ethnicity) told me he would make me a new one. While he's making it, I was subjected to listening to the other baristas talk about me, stare at me, and discuss what was going on which made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The service I had was absolutely horrendous to say the very least. I was not only appalled by the fact that this employee not only messed my drink up once, but TWICE, and instead of having the decency to apologize--stood there and gossiped about me with her fellow co-workers. The ONLY person who was helpful and apologetic was the man who fixed my drink. Never mind the fact that I'm a regular customer, but no business can expect to develop regular customers if this is the sort of service they receive. I have worked in the restaurant/service industry nearly my entire life and I would have been immediately fired if I ever behaved in the way that these employees did today.

The service is always incredibly slow and there are lots of language barriers, but I always thought the people were nice, and that the drinks were exceptionally good.   Unfortunately Saxby's just made my morning a bit more hectic than necessary.  I went to Saxby's yesterday in person to place a catering order for this morning.  I wanted bagels, fruit and coffee for 5 people, for a 7:45am pick up.  I was told that the \"fruit order didn't come in that early in the morning\", so I had to do the yogurt parfait, which was fine.  I prepaid with the UPenn credit card (this was for Penn Dental Medicine which is in the building directly behind the store).  I called 30 minutes before pick up (7:15am) and spoke with Geetha (the manager), she was very difficult to understand on the phone, but she eventually figured out that I was the 7:45am catering order.  She told me that they do in fact have fruit, so I told her I would add that and take away half of the parfaits.  When I arrived at exactly 7:45am, NOTHING was ready.  I waited, and took things over to the meeting (which was to start at 8am) as they were ready.  Coffee first and the fruit / yogurt.  I was told they don't have plates.. which is confusing, because they have bagels, what was I supposed to do, have people at the meeting eating the bagels off of the table?  I came back and told them that there wasn't any cream for the coffee.  At this point Geetha announced to the whole store that \"because I was in such a rush, and I was late, that I forgot the cream\"... this was incredibly rude AND INACCURATE!  After I gathered all of the items that were supposed to be ready at 7:45am, it was now 8:05am and the meeting had already started.  I actually owed them a little money since the fruit cups are more expensive than the yogurts.  So when I paid I very calmly said to her how rude it was that she said I was late, when in fact they were late.  At that point she told me that my pick up time was 8am... this is not at all true.  I confirmed it two or three times with her.  Fortunately this means I never have to use Saxby's for any Penn Dental orders again, but I can't believe that is how they prepare to-go or catering orders.  \nLesson Learned:\nIf you are coming here for a drink, and you are not in a rush, this place is fine and the drinks are good.

Oh saxbys you have let me down. :(  \nStill love the drinks.", "date": "2013-11-29 21:37:18", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 19, "average_stars": 4.05, "yelping_since": "2012-11-10 00:47:07"}}

I went there ONCE during a dentist appointment and got some strawberry smoothie thing that cost $3.56. It was fine, not great, not bad. But what happened next is what forced me to have to call corporate on this branch. I noticed that i had a charge from my first visit on my account. Two weeks later, there was another charge for the same amount on a day that i was no where near Penn's campus. I called and i was handed off to two different employess who told me that the manager was not available and they would leave her a message. I never heard from the manager. i called back another time to speak to the manager, he/she wasn't available again. Both of the times i called, they told me it was a computer glitch and it would dissappear in a day or two. I called back a third time when the charge still had not dissappeared, and was given the run around once again. I finally gave up and called corporate to report them, since although this was not a huge charge, i wondered how many other people they had done this to that maybe hadn't noticed? I called and left a message and then emailed them to be sure i got a hold of someone. i spoke to a woman named Linda who said she would send me a free drink card. A free drink card? You commit credit card fraud and i am supposed to forgive you because you are sending me a free drink card? Linda says the branch manager  will contact me, a week passes and i still no one contacts me. I wrote Linda back and told her i was reporting them to my bank for credit card fraud. A few days later i get an email from an employee ( not a manager) at Saxby's who tells me i can come in to get my refund! Too bad I had already reported them for credit card fraud and received my refund from the bank. FYI these Saxby's chains are individually owned and operated, so this one may be TERRIBLE but another one may be great since different people own them under one large umbrella company. This branch doesn't not deserve your patronage, and if you do visit here often, check your bank statements.", "date": "2010-02-04 15:04:10", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 255, "average_stars": 3.62, "yelping_since": "2010-02-01 18:50:52"}}

The cashiers will greet you politely and even carry conversations with a smile, never with an air of obligation. The customer service is great even if it takes a bit longer than usual. I appreciate that they take longer because they are more likely to make my order right. For example, they'll work calmly to mix your espresso and then carefully measure the foam and flavor. Once, while it was slow, the cashier and I had a fun 5 minute conversation about the pros and cons of cappuccinos. It was nice to not be treated like cattle like at the Starbucks at Commons one street over. I've heard the place did not use to be as clean as it is now although it's hard to believe considering how good it looks. But the best part is that their coffee is awesome. It's rich and and really wakes you up. Their flavorings aren't bland either and their mocha latt\u00e9 is particularly great. They're almost as pricey if not more than Starbucks but they're much more committed to satisfaction and quality. \n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "date": "2015-12-22 21:38:43", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 37, "average_stars": 3.22, "yelping_since": "2011-11-16 19:02:09"}}

What makes it better is the customer service. All the employees I have interacted with are super sweet and accommodating! \n\nPictured in my review is The Daily Grind smoothie. It's perfect for anyone who wants something healthy and sweet. This smoothie contains a nice mix of Cold Brew, banana, peanut butter, dates, and oat milk. One thing I love about it is the smoothness and the tiny little date chunks that come out every now and then.
