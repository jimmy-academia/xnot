The Scapegoat is great: soft, cool goat cheese on a hot pressed ciabatta loaf, with pesto, the best red onions I've had in a while, spinach, and tomatoes. Simply, satisfying, and (I will kid myself probably) not too bad for you. Their bagels are also some of the better ones I have been able to find in the city, not too dense, toasted nicely, with flavorful toppings--and the veggie and chive cream cheese are standouts.\n\nAs for their hot drinks, they're good, very good. During the winter months I can only come to Mugshots a few times every month because otherwise I would just be ordering the creme brulee latte all of the time, and neither my waistline nor my wallet would thank me. It's a sweet, guilty pleasure. The aztec hot chocolate is also great. \n\nIn addition, although I've never participated in the buying club, I like that Mugshots has the option to buy locally sourced ingredients, although it's probably just cheaper to go to a farmer's market. Still, the homemade red potato salad that they have using these ingredients was a standout that I am going to have to buy again: tangy (it tasted like it had some yogurt in addition to/instead of mayo), chilled, fresh, and bursting with dill and some garlic, it was the perfect accompaniment to our homemade Scapegoat knockoff.\n\nIn short, it's pricey, but once in a while, it's nice to drop by, have a drink, and split a tasty, freshly prepared sandwich--just not if you're in a hurry.", "date": "2009-08-04 14:51:20", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 149, "average_stars": 3.68, "yelping_since": "2008-08-10 00:28:31"}}

Great location..check.  Cool, casual atmosphere...check.  Inked and pierced hipster baristas...check.  Good coffee (the Guatemalen blend is my favorite)...check.\n\nWhat Mugshots lacks is a good system of service that allows customers to order and receive their drinks and food in a reasonable amount of time without wanting to take hostages.  With their much-anticipated expansion about 2 years back (they doubled their size by taking over the space next door) you'd have thought they would have a better flow going with their drink and food preparation.  Not so much.  Food orders (especially on the weekend when it's most crowded with yuppie weekend warriors and their offspring in strollers) take...roughly..forever!  The staff is mostly friendly, but sometimes seem distracted or disorganized.  The place is not what you'd call a model of efficiency, shall we say.  \n\nOK, maybe I'm being a bit harsh.  But that's because I used to love this place.  I was happy to have a cool, comfortable place in the neighborhood to work on my laptop while sipping on a latte.  Now, they've sealed up most of the power outlets to keep customers from camping out too long (probably a good business decision, but annoying nonetheless), and you have to make a purchase every hour in order to get a unique wi-fi \"code\" to use their network.  Again, probably good for profits, but do I need to keep having the network drop while I'm working or sending an email?  What Mugshots fails to get is that people WILL spend money if they hang out for a couple of hours, without all the restraints and rules.  Those tend to fly in the face of the laid-back, bohemian vibe they've got going on.\n\nStill...good sandwiches, salads, coffee, and tea.  Plus they're fair-trade and organic, which I kind of like.  \n\nWish I could do better than a 3, but they're not really there..sorry.", "date": "2011-03-27 00:33:26", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 18, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2011-02-15 22:15:46"}}

I had some time to kill before catching my bus, so I didn't really mind standing in line for a while and browsing their menu. Looks like they have some tasty options, and as someone looking to incorporate more vegan and local cuisine into my diet, I found the menu exciting.  However, the prices on some of these things (and the fact that I was on my way to a Honey's Brunch-- seriously, an addiction) deterred me.  \n\nAs a company that snubs Starbucks (and hey, I do too, so I appreciate it!), I was a little perplexed by their coffee menu, which looked like it had some pretty frou-frou and expensive drinks not unlike the bigger chains.  I like places that list a cup of coffee as being COFFEE, not Americano, or \"mugshot,\" whatever that is (is it their coffee? plain? Suppose I could've asked).  I got the Mayan Chai tea, mainly because I found their coffees overpriced.  Let me say, it was delicious!  And I'm really happy they offer a variety of milks (including soy) by the counter, not just cream.  Probably my biggest peeve about DD is that they don't have milks and sugars out on a counter for you to mix in, but my problems with Dunks' should probably be reserved for a different review.\n\nOverall, cute little place, a little overcrowded and hipstery/yuppie-ish, but I like their mission to provide decent vegetarian/vegan options and fair-trade drinks.", "date": "2008-12-11 16:46:03", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 78, "average_stars": 3.93, "yelping_since": "2008-10-03 13:56:00"}}

The place was very crowded, and when it was our turn to order we noticed that there weren't any free seats. So my girlfriend told the cashier that we weren't sure if we were going to order because of the lack of available seating. Before she even finished this sentence, the cashier smirked, pointed to the line like we didn't know it was there, and gestured to the person behind us to place their order. She didn't say a single word to us. \n\nI understand that that isn't the type of thing a cashier wants to hear when it is busy. We were, however, going to ask her for just a second to decide what we wanted to do. But apparently she didn't feel like giving us the chance. It's like she felt that she was doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to order, and since we had inconvenienced her so terribly she decided to revoke that privilege. Overall, this woman came off as impatient and condescending. I must say it is ironic for a cashier to have a superiority complex. \n\nThe very fact that there was no available seating was also, in itself, annoying. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but I looked around a bit and noticed that about half of the customers were sitting there typing away on their Macbooks while nursing small coffees (some of them were just drinking water from Nalgene bottles). Even worse, many of them were sitting alone at tables meant for multiple people. And worst of all, every single one of them was a hipster. \n\nI know I am going to tick a lot of people off with these comments, but let's be serious here: Mugshots isn't just a \"coffee shop\" like Starbucks. They also serve breakfast and lunch. And people would like the opportunity to sit down and eat said foodstuffs. But they don't get the chance if everyone else thinks its acceptable to buy a cup of coffee and then sit there for extended periods of time writing term papers, brooding poetry, or whatever they consider to be trendy. This is fine when the place isn't so busy, but during rush hours it is downright inconsiderate. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY PUT A ONE HOUR LIMIT ON WIFI ACCESS FOR CUSTOMERS!!!!!\n\nI should mention that although we left without ordering, we had been to Mugshots once before and the food was pretty tasty. This doesn't make up for the awful customer service and the droves of self-absorbed \"cool kid\" customers, however. \n\nSo in sum, go to Mugshots if you enjoy:\n-Good sandwiches (if you don't mind paying high prices and waiting a half an hour for your food to come out)\n-Snarky and disrespectful staff members\n-Not being able to find an open seat\n-Being around gaggles of hipsters who think the place is a library, or a Starbucks, or something. \n\nEND RANT!", "date": "2012-03-05 06:06:36", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 15, "average_stars": 2.67, "yelping_since": "2011-10-09 21:51:41"}}

One of my favorite pastimes is to stand in line and watch people get angry because they don't get what they want. Pro-tip: you're probably not that special\n\nWhat people forget when they make a decision to skip Starbucks and hit up a local coffee shop is that they forfeit their rights to \"have it your way\" service.

You're not eating at a Stephen Starr restaurant- you're getting a burrito and a coffee.\n\nAlso, tickets get lost, mixed up or even forgotten. I've sat many places and watch the same food I ordered get served out to people who placed their orders after me. It happens\n\nFor as much as I'm willing to stick my neck out for Mugshots, I will admit there have been many a times I've walked away unhappy with my order. But that's part of eating out- you're not guaranteed perfection every time. Maybe the kitchen messed up, maybe the produce for the week isn't that good, maybe suppliers have been switched. Who knows, but goodness knows you most likely don't.\n\nThe food here is pretty darn good, the coffee has gotten way better and the customer service, although shaky, is great if you can take the time out of your day to treat the person behind the counter like a human being.

It was mad busy when we went there but we found a table without much trouble. My girlfriend got the Vegan BLT with apple and enjoyed it thoroughly. They use the tempeh bacon which I am generally not a huge fan of, but overall, the sandwich was delicious. She also got the vegan chili and was unable to finish it due to it being way too hot for her... which made it perfect for me!  I got \"The Slammer\"  which is a wrap with vegan sausage, guacamole, salsa and lettuce. It was a tad small for my liking, but the taste was undeniably good.\n\nThe also offer a ton of smoothies, juices and milkshakes all with vegan options. We ended up getting the organic lemonade with blueberries... simple and amazingly delicious.\n\nI also got a cafe au lait with soymilk which was pretty good. I am not a huge coffee afficianado so unless something it really bad, it's pretty much all the same to me.\n\nOne of the overriding negative comments on here about this place is the slow service. Like I said earlier, I went there on Labor Day and they were PACKED. It took us about 10 minutes to even order and another 20 for our names to be called for our food... not that bad given how busy it was. Everyone behind the counter seemed to be hustling and doing their best to get the food out as quickly as possible.

What does a girl want more than an egg sandwich on a Saturday morning. Instead of nice eggs, folded over from the griddle, I received some baked holey mess. Instead of cheese spilling over the eggs it was seemingly absent.\n\nWhen inquiring about the aesthetics and taste of the rubbery eggs the one employee began an obviously rehearsed spiel about how more people prefer their eggs baked and fluffy, that it's healthier and the eggs are so local they were fresh, just delivered yesterday. \n\nTo give credit where credit is due, he did try to accommodate by offering to make the sandwich again, yet it would still be baked into a square chunky mess of holey eggs. I declined and he told me that all major chains like Dunkin Donuts and Wawa bake their eggs, still harping on how most people prefer it that way.\n\nIf I was looking for shitty baked eggs I would go to Wawa, pay way less and wouldn't regret trying to get decent food from a presumably locally owned establishment. \n\nIt was at this point that the one line-cook offered to fry me some eggs on the griddle, something that the other employee never even offered. I was grateful that someone was listening to a customer's opinion instead of reciting what popular opinion polls found. \n\nI understand new owners mean a new style of doings things, but I didn't think when the shop boasted on Facebook about shorter waiting times it meant they were industrializing local and creating a more popular, yet less tasty egg.\n\nI will have to look elsewhere for a morning breakfast sandwich, unfortunately I am of the apparent minority who prefers an old fashioned egg.

I have never once had an experience there related to customer/employee interaction that has EVER been more than a two at most. I'm going to go ahead and share all of these experiences. Maybe (but probably not) someone at Mugshots will care this time. \n\nToday: Brought all my school work and computers down to Mugshots to work on school work. There Wi-fi is accessible for 60 minutes only with purchase and with a code provided by the cashier (I am not even complaining about this fact but still, come one guys, free wi-fi is a little give for a lot of get in the coffee shop world. Your image could use a boost.). I also ordered an egg, tomato, guacamole, and cheese sandwich and an americano. Americano was fine. Sandwich was made with obviously old guac...it was brown, cold, and flavorless as avocados tend to become when refrigerated for too long. I was contemplating asking for a different sandwich but then I thought better of it because I would just be met with blank stares and don't care attitudes (those things are extremely commonplace with the staff). The first code I received for wi-fi access came up with \"promotional access denied.\" So I asked for assistance, was given another code, and that one did not work either. When I went back to the counter and said that it didn't work either the guy said he didn't know. He asked two of his co-workers about it and they said \"Last time it happened, we had to call the company.\" Then the three of them kinda stood there with blank stares (like I said, a common response). Then the guy said \"Well, how do I do that.\" One girl shrugged her shoulders and the other said \"Oh, I don't know I don't go into the office.\" More blank stares then the guy said to me, \"Sorry, I don't know what to do.\" What?! You DO know what to do, dude. Call the company and fix the problem. Obviously this has happened before as your co-workers pointed out and obviously the solution is to call the provider. However, none of them wanted to do it so I was told \"Too bad.\" Really, Mugshots? You know how to solve a problem but you don't do it because...you're lazy? You don't want to? It's not \"your\" job? What is it? This is a common theme throughout all of my negative experiences here. Disconnected, disinterested, too-cool-for-school employees who can't be bothered with simple customer service. \n\nA summary of other complaints:\n\n1. A few weeks ago I ordered an Americano. There were three people at the registers and one person in the kitchen area. I waited 18 minutes (I timed it on my phone) before I said anything. I said \"excuse me, is someone going to make my drink?\" Yes, I said it with a little bit of an attitude. The girl stared at me (blank stares!) then said, \"Yea, give me am minute\" and went back to the registers where two other people were (there are only two registers so...) Two minutes later she went to the espresso machine clearly annoyed and sloppily made my drink. It was filled all the way to the top making it difficult to carry to the condiment stand. I felt it was done on purpose. My evidence: the smirk and \"here you go\" delivered with an attitude when she handed me the drink.\n\n2. Last Saturday morning (an insanely busy time at Mugshots) I was waiting in line along with 16 other customers (I counted because I wanted to write a Yelp review and be accurate) for my morning coffee. Some man walks in the door, cuts to an open register before the woman waiting in line gets to it. The woman seemed confused and said she was too embarrassed to say anything so I leaned over and said to the cashier, \"That man just cut in front of everyone.\" The cashier look flustered, said \"oh, I just got here\" and continued to help the man instead of asking him to wait in line. Yea, no. \n\n3. The food and drink are over-priced for the quality of customer service. I understand that Mugshots supports local and sustainable farms and I truly appreciate that and understand that that means higher prices. I wouldn't have a problem paying them if I was treated like the PAYING customer that I am.\n\n\nSo, the reason why I keep going here is two-fold. One, I live 4 blocks away and I will put up with a lot for convenience and non-Starbucks coffee. Two, I'm somehow convinced it will get better. I, for some reason, believe management will catch on to the arrogant, disrespectful ignorant way it's staff operates and make changes.
