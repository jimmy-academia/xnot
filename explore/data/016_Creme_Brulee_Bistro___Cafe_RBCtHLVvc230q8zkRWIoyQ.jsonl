My fiance and I recently tried this place after hearing great things time and time again from other local patrons.  This unassuming restaurant, which seats about 10 patrons, is serving up fresh bread, French pastries and delicious breakfast.  \n\nOn the weekends, we've stopped in for breakfast and were surprised to see a full menu of delicious options.  Thus far, we've had the Creme Brulee Omelette, which is a delicious omelette filled with spinach and mushrooms, served with a fresh slice of house made bread (so good) and your choice of breakfast potatoes or mixed greens.  The mixed greens are tossed in a delicious house made dressing, which is perfectly balanced and refreshing.  The waffles are served with fresh berries and sweetened condensed milk and come with a side of scrambled eggs.  While lots of restaurants have waffles on the menu, this place knows how to make a great waffle, which had the slightest hint of sweetness and was perfectly cooked. The french toast is also very good and came paired with scrambled eggs too.  On the weekends they just started making Chai teas, perfectly created and served by the owner's sister in law, a trained barista, who is coming down from NYC on the weekends to help this budding establishment.  \n\nThe pastries are also delicious.  We've had the most delicious miniature tart pies and croissants, not to mention the macaroons, which are also house made. Most pastries run about $3.50.  Everything here is just so good!  Also for those who like fresh juice, Armando (the owner) and his team prepare fresh juice daily, ranging in price from $3.00-5.00.   \n\nThe owner is also just SO nice and kind.  He eagerly shared his vision for the restaurant and let us know they close in the evening for reservations only, serving fresh fish and mussels in addition to other options.

The food is AMAZING. Armando, the chef and I believe owner, is wonderful. He even gave us a run down of the pastries and desserts which look amazing in the case. I could only give this place 3 stars because for dessert we ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I mean that is the name of the restaurant and I actually came for this dessert specifically. When the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e came to the table, the top which is supposed to be BRULEE'd, meaning a hard top just torched was a liquid syrup, literally. So they serve it right out of the case and it appears that they br\u00fbl\u00e9e it a day or even days before. You absolutely cannot serve Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e without the top coat of sugar being hard. It was literally a brown syrup. We sent it back and the server seemed to torch the syrup on top that had already been previously brulee'd. THEN, he put salt all over the top, it was GROSS and the top was a charcoal black all over. I was so disappointed and it was really really bad. The sad thing is, is that the custard/ creme was yummy but it doesn't matter if you can't br\u00fbl\u00e9e the top properly. There is an easy fix, torch the custard per order, it should not be sitting in the case already brulee'd getting soft. The server tried to explain to us that the refrigerator case softens the top and that the temperature was the reason why it doesn't come out right. If you name your restaurant Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, you have to do Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e right. If I had just come for that desert, I would never have come back.

I came for a sandwich which was not available. Which is their option.  But my to-go chai was placed on the counter with no lid and rudely told she would make an exception \"this time\" re payment. And that was only when I argued that my other option was to take nothing.  So diner beware, They do not always accept cards,  (During my 2nd visit the system was down).

We walked in around 11:00am and saw there were no open tables. We waited outside, in the rain waiting for a table to open up. After 10 minutes a couple got up and moved toward the front counter waiting for a to go order. I asked one of the servers for a table for 2 and she pointed to the dirty table that just opened up. I waited in the front doorway for one of the 2 servers to clear and clean the table. Waited about 10 more minutes while they were more interested in waiting on the take out customers. We finally sat at the dirty table hoping that one of the servers would take the cue and come over and clear and clean the table. Nope, she came over with menus and I had to ask to have the table wiped off. She left and came back with a dirty rag and wiped down the table leaving 3 unused glasses upside down on the table from the last customers. After she walked away, we realized the table was still sticky and dirty. At this point we had lost our appetite and got up and walked out. No one even asked what was wrong? This is no way to run a business! If you can't handle sit down dining and only seem to care about take out orders, STOP serving and just do take out. I'm very sad about today's experience since I really love the food here and it's only 4 blocks from my house. Message to the owner....find better servers or just do take out! Not fare to those of us that want to sit down and eat! I would love the opportunity to discuss this with the owner! I look forward to a response.", "date": "2021-05-29 16:47:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 36, "average_stars": 3.59, "yelping_since": "2014-04-12 15:34:12"}}

My boyfriend and I stopped by for a Christmas Eve brunch, and the quaint cafe with only one other couple felt warm, greeting us with a refrigerated case of sweet goods. I got the French Toast while he got the Classic Burger, as well as coffee and Earl Grey, and everything was made pretty well. \n\nI was excited that the berry coulis was not too sweet, and the french toast wasn't soggy but had a great crisp on the outside as well as a soft inside. I was a little disappointed with the scrambled eggs being a little too underdone for my tastes but I'm just picky so I'm not going to fault them on that. They did, however, forget to add his cheese, but that was fixed pretty quickly. His report: burger cooked to proper temperature, coffee was decent.\n\nThe food was overall pretty good, but it certainly didn't blow my socks off. I'm a sucker for atmosphere and it's hard to gauge a place based on one visit, so I'll be sure to come back with more fun details on other menu items!", "date": "2017-12-24 22:39:50", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 300, "average_stars": 3.97, "yelping_since": "2014-09-05 04:24:48"}}

I'm not impressed, but I really wanted to be \nMy sister lives in this neighborhood and took me to her favorite place for brunch. We brought a bottle of moscato(it is byob) and we're greeted quickly by the staff. The service was fantastic, from start to finish. That needs to be said. The seating area is small, but even on a Saturday we did not have to wait. They even have an outdoor area. \nMy sister recommended the California Benedict. I am a huge Benny fan so I quickly took the suggestion.  Hollandaise is one of my favorite breakfast sides! The Benedict is served on top of homemade bread, seasoned potatoes, two eggs, hollandaise, and fresh greens. Visually it was impressive! Taste wise, it was bland. The eggs and potato's were cold. My sister said her potatoes were cold but her omelette was hot. I'm assuming they poached the eggs first, but they were not even luke warm. The most upsetting was the hollandaise sauce.  It did not have a distinct taste and was also cold. \n\nI trust my sister and these reviews rave about this place! I just didn't have a good first visit and I left without a memorable food experience.", "date": "2019-08-04 17:18:29", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 282, "average_stars": 4.06, "yelping_since": "2011-02-08 04:34:46"}}
