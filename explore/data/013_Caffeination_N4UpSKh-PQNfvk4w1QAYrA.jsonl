However, the service is still pretty sub-par. The employees are not very friendly and do not make an effort to accommodate customers. The mediocre quality of the service is particularly noticeable in comparison to the excellent service at Good Karma and Joe, both of which are located just a few blocks away from Caffeination. \n\nATMOSPHERE: The chairs are uncomfortable and the temperature is way too hot. This place is also pretty strict about the wireless policy. You can only access the wireless for a limited period of time, which is a little annoying. It's not the best place to work because the tables are right next to each other so you can hear everyone's conversation. \n\nCOFFEE: Most importantly, the coffee here is terrible. The coffee is either weak and/or tastes burnt. The pastries also look stale and unappetizing. \n\nThis place also has a $5 minimum for credit cards, which is very irritating. \n\nI would go to La Colombe, Joe, Good Karma and even Starbucks on 19th over this place.", "date": "2014-10-01 19:50:57", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 62, "average_stars": 3.37, "yelping_since": "2012-05-12 16:39:31"}}

I kept hoping each bite would somehow get better, but no, it was just a cup (kind of) full of plastic tasting soup. You can't do that to soup!

Given, however, that my companion had already had a rude experience and bad food during a previous visit, I felt a rating of one star is fair. \n\nI understand if people had good experiences with the food and service there, but there is absolutely NO excuse for someone in a position of authority to treat customers so disrespectfully. She not only convinced us get up and leave, but was so offensive that she now has two customers who will never go back, and in addition, are spreading the word on what a rude establishment Caffeination is.", "date": "2011-02-12 22:20:00", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 3, "average_stars": 3.0, "yelping_since": "2011-02-12 20:41:38"}}

Read on if you want the full unbelievable story.\n\nOK, I know I am an environment freak, so I always either bring my own cup or drink-in at a place that has mugs.  They do.  Fine so far.  I order bagels and coffee for here, but then the coffee comes in paper...with plastic lids...with sleeves...\nI'm cringing but I drink it.  They do offer to correct.\nI'm finished and I decide to ask how they designate for-here orders, explaining that I try to avoid throwaways.  The barista who made the mistake pipes up that \"you have to order 'for here'\" as if it is my mistake.  Never mind that the bagels were correctly served on plates.\nI explain again how passionate I am about not generating trash and how I could not have ordered to-go, but by then one of them is on the phone to the police! (at least they said)\nI asked why, they actually told me \"because you are being rude\".  Another of them called me an @ssh0le.\nAttitude?\n\nUpdate: I've since been back with good results.

Seems to be a pretty place to get a cup of coffee, coffee-like drink, pastry or snack.  The regular coffee was ok... a little bitter for my taste, but I know that's some people's cup of tea... err, coffee.  They also have about 50 flavored syrups for coffee or italian sodas.\n\nIt was WARM inside.  I love a toasty place in winter, but they could stand to turn down the thermostat just a couple notches.  Or who knows, maybe it's not always that sweltering.  I also noticed they have free wi-fi and ample seating.\n\nPrices didn't seem bad either - a medium coffee was $1.65 plus tax.  I appreciate that drinks come in \"small, medium, large, etc\" rather than \"tall, grande, venti\", all of which sound big to me.\n\nGood coffee, good location, pleasant.

My job hooks up a swank coffee discount so I really didn't need to come here. But it was a brand new coffeehouse, and McThrill gets drawn to those like a moth does to a lamppost. On top of that the name of the house is McThrill's drug of choice! So resist was something that I just couldn't do.\n\nThe place's grand opening is on Saturday. So they were pretty much open and working out the kinks before their big occasion. So it is too early to fully criticize. But it's a good thing that they're working out those kinks because they were definitely there. They had one of those counter prep systems where one person works the register, another does the food, and another preps the drinks. That usually works for places like Dunkin Donuts and Fourbucks (or even Bonte and Coffee Bar) because they usually have 5 or more people working the counter. But when you have 3 people working under that system it usually only succeeds in making everyone involved wait longer. And in the end it took them longer to get me a large coffee than just about, oh, every other indie coffeehouse in Philly that I've been to (If your keeping track on my list than that's a pretty big number).\n\nBut as far as product and quality Caffeination definitely has it. The Large coffee was the perfect wake up call that I needed in the morning. And I definitely noted the delicious looking pastries and variety of bagels. They also had an incredible assortment of drinks in the cold case. The menu also has an number of inexpensive sandwiches. So if they figure out a better counter system, or get a little more in the groove over the weeks to come, than Caffeination might just be on the road to some good things.
