They had great food, good customer service, and parking around the neighborhood was easy to find. However, on my most recent visit, I found myself questioning this place. It could have been an off day, but everything was such a miss-- food and customer service. \n\nI came with a group of 5, which is a little large for such a small establishment. We tried to call several times houra beforehand to put in a reservation, but the phone kept going to an automated message and telling us to try again. With no luck, we decided to just go and try our luck. We found parking right away, but came in just after a couple of larger parties. We waited for our table with a couple of cups of coffee. \n\nBy the time our table was ready, our cups were empty, but we were distracted by the menus. But our coffee was never filled until we prompted the waitress. Once filled, I had a steaming cup, whereas my friend had a lukewarm, almost cold cup of coffee. We brushed it off and just ordered our food. We noticed our waitress greet another table nearby and list off specials that were not written on the regular or specials menu. She had never recited them to us and they sounded more enticing than what we had actually ordered since the menu had changed since our last visit. The whole restaurant just seemed to be more chaotic and disorganized than ever before. \n\nAgain, we had to prompt our waitress to fill our coffee for the second time, but it was almost already at the end of our meal. She had checked in with us once, but turned around before we had answered her and could ask her for something, which we then had to wait another 10 mins to grab her attention. \n\nAs for the food, I have had way better from them and elsewhere. Everything we had ordered was really bland and underwhelming. The only people who enjoyed the food were my younger cousins who like anything sweet or with pancakes. \n\nI might come back again, but I am officially turned off and unimpressed. I am sad to have had such a bad experience when I have been 2-3 times before and enjoyed myself. Maybe I just need to find a new local favorite.", "date": "2018-05-20 05:45:34", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 175, "average_stars": 3.85, "yelping_since": "2016-11-19 15:34:11"}}

Holidays, cooking in, cold weather, and nothing too exciting on the restaurant front have all conspired against me trying out new places. I'll definitely have two new posts for restaurant week.\n\nI went to Hinge Cafe for brunch on Sunday.  I went to this spot months ago, and decided to try it out again.  Despite its location on a weird block on Port Richmond, this spot was packed for Sunday brunch.  We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated.  It's nice to be able to have a good brunch spot close by without epic Sabrinia's-esc waits.  \n\nI had an omelet that was on special.  It was filled with cheese, and several kinds of peppers and onions.  It was a generous portion, probably a three egg omelet.  With the side of potatoes, it was honestly enough food to fill me up for the entire day.  Dining with my friend Bryana, she also ordered from the special board: eggs florentine.  She had a similar assessment as myself; the meal was delicious and served in generous portions.\n\nThere are two factors that impress me the most about Hinge: The coffee is excellent and served continuously, and the menu is extensive.  There were several great offerings on the board for specials that I didn't even take a serious look at the regular menu.  I could easily come back here several times in the future and have a lot of good, different options.  Hinge doesn't just do brunch, either, they have a good offers for all meals.\n\nBottom Line: Hinge offers quick service and meals at affordable prices.  It makes a great brunch spot that is (for me) close to home.  I've never been at night, but apparently Hinge also host small music events.  It would even make a great stop for a coffee shop, as it has a few small tables up front and a bakery case filled with mouthwatering desserts.

My companion had the scallops, which were nicely seared, a nice size, and just about perfect.  The duck too, was excellent.  The maple and sherry flavor was not too sweet or overpowering.  The breast was cooked fine.\nI have a problem with the sides.  Risotta was just rice.  I got a thing about risotto, and I watch enough food porn to know exactly what it should be like.  Creamy, not just a pile of rice.  Tasty rice, but plain old rice. (Ever see the movie \"The Big Night\" with Stanley Tucci and Tony Shaloub...it revolves around making risotto, great film.)  Parsnip potatoes were iffy.  I never had a  parsnip, they sound like something my grandmom would make if she ran out of rutabagas.  But they must be very mild, because I couldn't taste them.   My mashed potatoes stand on the plate like clay after five minutes, I don't expect theirs to.\nAnd the next time someone throws some wilted baby spinach on my plate, and calls it a vegtable of the day, I'm gonna freak.  Its wilted spinach!  Its sooo cheap.  You can't throw a couple of asparagus spears on there instead? For a $22 plate?\nThe dessert was probably delicious.  By then, I had some early signs of alcohol poisoning, so it went into a styro box and home.  It didn't last in my fridge longer than 5mins, so I will assume it was good.\nI really like the Hinge...the staff is nice, the food is generally very good, and its comfortable. I will be back again, many times I'm sure.  But I'm just wondering if the bloom is off the rose.\nUPDATED 7/20/12\nIn the past, I know I have doubted whether or not they were still on their game.\nSince then, I've been back monthly, and I have to retract that statement.\nI really think this is the hidden gem of the area.\nWent last night, and it was really, just unspeakably good.\nGrilled watermelon with bacon and feta cheese.\nTempura fried asparagus,\nBronzino with tropical fruit salsa with coconut rice,\nChicken Grand Marnier with mandarin oranges and cranberries.....\nDelicious desserts.\nSo, so, very good.\n\nhttp://www.hingecafe.com/", "date": "2012-12-10 15:40:48", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 26, "average_stars": 3.84, "yelping_since": "2011-07-11 18:58:50"}}

I rarely wait for a table, or coffee, the waitresses are awesome, and the food is top-notch.

We planned a party for my parents' 60th birthdays and the Hinge made the whole experience fantastic. Simone was super responsive over email, and helped me plan a great menu AND stay within my budget. On the night of, I hooked up my playlist, set out flower arrangements, and welcomed my folks into their favorite brunch place, which was now our private party space! My entire family was so impressed with the decor and the service. Our waitress Jill paid very close attention to everyone's orders for food & drink. After we sang and blew out candles (that Jill brought out because I forgot them!) they took the cake back and portioned it out into individual slices, half on plates and half to go! Everyone ate their faces off AND took goodie bags home. \n\nThe hardest part of this entire experience was keeping the secret from my parents. The staff @ the Hinge made everything so easy! I can't thank them enough for taking a lot of stress off my shoulders so I could enjoy the party with my family! If you are looking for a cozy, comfortable space for a party, where you can play your own music, get served amazing food, and enjoy stellar service from awesome people, my recommendation is to get on the horn with Simone and reserve the date NOW!

We then realized that the house next door was attached, providing ample seating (our server also told us there was an upstairs). \n\n-- Hinge has a rotating menu that changes every month.  Some of the house favorites, like the Penne Vodka remain, but most items rotate. \n\nAppetizer: The Wedge Salad - $6 - a 1/3 of a head of Iceberg lettuce cleaned and cut.

REALLY hungry... this past Saturday for good brunch food- and I couldn't have been happier to saunter into the Hinge Cafe.\n\nFirst impression- COOL!  The art on the walls could have kept me entertained for hours- lots going on (and all for sale).  I loved the vibe of the place.  It was cool, comfortable, and not particularly portentous.  Just good food- who can't get down with that?\n\nWe walked in and sat right down- which is an amazing thing on a Saturday morning at a place that has a reputation for being busy.  We had a great little table off to the side.  Our waitress brought us water immediately (i think she could read my rosy cheeks and knew not to spare a minute!), and then took our coffee/tea order.  My boyfriend went for a vanilla latte and it was delicious!  I went for an iced tea that was strong, tasty, and came with a big ol' slice of lemon.  When I got a lemon seed implanted in my straw, my waitress laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation, and hooked a sister up w a new straw :-).\n\nFor breakfast I ordered the skillet which came with 2 eggs my way (over easy) perched atop sauteed onions and green peppers, roasted potatoes and an abundance of cheddar cheese with 2 pieces of rye toast.  Everything was even more delicious than it looked.  Some of the potato slices were kinda on the huge side, but it sure didn't stop me from eating just about the whole thing... which from a volume perspective is asinine.  \n\nMy boyfriend had something (I was too busy chowing down to notice) that he enjoyed- i noted scrapple- 2 pieces cut thin cooked super-crispy.  I'm a vegetarian- but I haven't always been this way... and when I ate scrapple, i preferred it cooked this way, but noticed it wasn't the norm.  He seemed pleased as well.  Finally, his pancakes.  OMG- perfection.  The buttermilk, the syrup, the fluffiness and the flavor- a vivid positive memory in my pancake history which is a very rich history I assure you.  I was stuffed, but I couldn't stop eating.  They were too good.\n\nCheck was reasonable- under $30 including tip which was really awesome considering our fancy coffees and the sheer volume of food.\n\nWe left Hinge Cafe, went home, and took a nap... one of those beautiful summer-day naps with the warm breeze and the windows open.

Well lets find out, because i think this spot is a winner.\n\nfirst off, it was father's day and they accommodated us, and opened up the top floor myself and my friends. eventually more guests came too, and it was a nice private area that was cooled off, and much more quiet than the rest of the cafe.\n\nservice was quick, the waitress was friendly and made sure our coffee and waters were filled and on point. and now for the foood.....\n\n\ni immediately jumped on the special for fathers day, the crab cake benedict (modestly priced at $14). our waitress said the chefs had made these at a special event, they were on point, and they just had to make them for the cafe. and well, she was right. they only had a certain amount, since they were made fresh and just for fathers day. i am one of those weirdos that finds it a positive that places run out of food, for the most part this means what im about to stuff in my mouth is made fresh. and hey they just ran out for that day. so anyway, the crab cakes were a perfect size and not much filler. big pet peeve of mine? crab cakes with a pound of bread crumbs and other fillers. as soon as she brought over my plate--i can smell the crab, fresh real crab ladies and gents! THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL! perfectly toasted english muffin, a nice plump egg. the hollandaise sauce was the perfect consistancy and flavor. the potatoes it came with, needed to be cooked a little longer in my opinion but they hit the spot. the buttery grits, the side i added, were good. not southern grits, but had a nice butter flavor and felt like mashed potatoes. overall, i truly loved this meal and appreciated the service since it was so busy but still got served pretty quickly.", "date": "2017-06-22 16:18:47", "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 7, "user": {"review_count": 1401, "average_stars": 3.89, "yelping_since": "2012-11-10 16:04:48"}}

First came the flat soda, followed my more flat soda when we sent it back. After settling on water, the cold tomato basil soup came. Not only was it cold, it contained weird chewy pieces that reminded me of the texture of animal fat. Next came the veggie burgers...Disgusting and I mean gross! I could have had a morning star burger at home that would have tasted better! Not only was it flavorless but it was so poorly constructed that I found myself chewing on bits of salt (a true sign that the burger was a mess)!

The hostess said 10-15 minutes to be on the safe side, we said not a problem.  While we were waiting, several other parties arrived of various sizes.  After watching table after table being sat, a few couples left (which were there before us) and that seemed to move us up in the line.  We then watched every single party that came in after us get sat.  40 minutes later we were sat and told by the same hostess that if anyone asked we should say there was third person in our party because we were in a 4 top.  I looked around the dining room and everyone was in a 4 top.  We read the reviews on Yelp and everyone said the food was great however when were served our food was either a) burnt to a crisp or b) the wrong order.  It took 30 minutes for the waitress to check back on us to even see how our meal was going.  She asked if everything was ok and when my wife said she got the wrong order the waitress said ok, i guess we will put the right order in this time.  My wife said no thanks and the waitress acted as if we were putting her out.  The waitress than looked at me and asked if I was ok.  I showed her my burnt skillet (not served in a skillet) and she then realized what was going on.  She grabbed my plate and took it back to the kitchen.  20 minutes later she said the owner would take care of our entrees but not the coffee and bagel.  I didn't ask for any comps or anything but to imply that I would need to pay for those items and that I was asking too much (again, never asked for anything) was off-putting.  The table next to us said that they used to get amazing food here but only when the owner cooks.  To me, it's not worth the gamble to see if the owner is cooking that day and the service alone would keep me away.

Hinge used to be one of my top 3 brunch places in Philly, but after my last visit, it has quickly dropped off my list completely.\n\nI was really looking forward to eating at Hinge again after not visiting for almost 2 years because.. life. I went with my BF and sister. My BF had the On the Border Skillet. My sister & I each ordered a Chai Latte, and for our food order, we had the Lite Bite Lunch Plate, which gives you the option to pick 2 or 3 options which includes soup, sandwich, and salad.  I had half the Chipotle Chicken Panini and a Garden Salad. My sister had the House Soup and Chicken Club sandwich. We shared a side of Cinnamon Bun Pancakes. Sadly, neither of us enjoyed our meal. \n\nThe Chai Latte was super foamy. At least half the mug was filled with foam, It tasted like a foamy milk latte with hardly any flavor. I didn't even taste the Chai at all. I was really disappointed in the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes. My BF & I had it plenty of times before. This time, it was different. The size was smaller, the texture was mushy, and it did not taste like how it used to. My Chipotle Chicken Panini was meh. It was a little dry and it lacked flavor. My sister did not enjoy her sandwich or her soup. The On the Border Skillet was really dry and... NOT in a skillet. There's a Breakfast Quesadilla on the menu for $9. It was essentially the same thing except you pay an extra $1 for the skillet in the name even though it wasn't in a skillet. Kind of sad & humorous if you ask me. It's either morale went down or everyone in that kitchen is new, maybe both? I don't know. \n\nThe service dropped as well. Our server was impatient and made us feel rushed when ordering. She seemed like she hates her job and it shows when she interacts with guests. There was a big party across from us and I witnessed one of the servers asking when the rest of their party was arriving and they said soon as they are already on their way. The server made it clear that she was annoyed and said \"I shouldn't have seated you since most of your party isn't here yet.\" I saw how appalled the guests were when she said that. Awkward...Definitely left a bad taste in their mouths. Overall, a very disappointing experience.

The wife and I showed up at 10:30 yesterday (Saturday). It was very busy but we waited less than five minutes.\n\n* Expect the coffee to be great and served in over-sized mugs.\n\n* Expect the menu to change frequently.  This can be good and bad.  You might see something that calls your name in one of the dozens of Yelp photos only to discover is was a special two months ago.\n\n* Expect classic rock to be playing in the background at just the right volume.\n\n* Expect a funky, eclectic atmosphere with original art on the walls that is also for sale.\n\n* Expect to meet your neighbors as the seating is tight.\n\n* Expect your brunch to coast about $10.  Most of the menu is within a dollar or two of that.\n\n* Expect the portions to be large.\n\n* Expect your waitress to be exceptional.  Yesterday ours was amazing and I took a few minutes to observe two other waitresses.  They appeared equally as good.\n\n* And most importantly EXPECT your food to be excellent.   The wife had the MONTE CHRISTO with raspberry preserves on the side.  I enjoyed a MEXICAN SKILLET dish that was packed with spicy sausage, black beans, corn, and served on top of a cheese quesadilla!
