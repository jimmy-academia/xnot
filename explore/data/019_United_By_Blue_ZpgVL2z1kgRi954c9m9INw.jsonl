It's a different world - like something out of Portland. Take a moment to eye the merch as you pass through the store.\n\nYou order from a counter, and if you're only having coffee and pastries then it's completely self serve. The coffee, served up in mugs, was quite good. We split a large croissant to nibble on while waiting for our hot meals. The croissant was quite good as well, crusty/flaky if rustic in appearance and not exactly authentically French.\n\nHaving gone two for two on our first two choices we eagerly awaited our meals. The grit cakes with bison sausage was the  winning dish. Perfectly cooked sunny side eggs, tasty cakes, and juicy, flavorful sausage. I probably should have changed my order when the counter-person told me I could not have sunny side up eggs with the salmon/bacon hash - the eggs would come scrambled in. This dish did not work for me. Had the eggs been separate, the hash - potato chunks, plentiful salmon, bacon, onion and scallion would have been divine under a runny egg yolk.  Mixed with egg, the hash could not develop crusty goodness. The  were overcooked, under-seasoned and made the whole dish a little bland. Adding salt, pepper and hot sauce after is not the same as cooking the seasonings into the eggs. The sourdough toast that accompanied the hash was near perfection, fresh, lightly buttered, toasted just enough.  Maybe if I come back and ask nicely, I can get fried eggs on top of hash the way it should be. UBB, please reconsider this dish.\n\nI would certainly return.

Well, it's a donut with cannoli cream in the middle. Uh huh.\n\nWell, you can only imagine how getting here and getting a donnoli became my mission. The mission was further pressed when a coworker came back with a donut and told me it was hand pressed. But it was no donnoli, so it was up to me to taste the glory.\n\n$5 later - yes that's right, a $5 donut - I had a donnoli in my hand. Not able to wait another minute, I crammed it into my mouth as I walked. The cannoli cream was pretty darn good. But the donut was a let down. It was kind of okay, maybe even a bit stale.\n\nUp there, at the top, where my review started, that's my bubble. Right here is where it burst.\n\nSo yeah, I got to taste a donnoli, and can say I had a $5 donut. I am more proud, though disappointed, of the former.

The quality of this shirt is such that it will last 20 years without visible wear.

You probably already knew that).\nAnd there's not just clothing, but bags, gifts, and home accessories.\nWhat's most impressive about this place is the owner, Brian. Now, I am biased. I do know Brian personally, as I was his personal trainer for a short period in the fall while he was working on opening the store. He and his lovely wife Joanna  (hi Joanna!) are simply two of the nicest, humblest people I've ever met. In fact, he never even spoke about the store like it was his own. It just sounded like a project they were working on together, not this monumental, charity-driven business endeavor.

I recently bought a t-shirt which was on sale - I really didn't mean to buy it, but as soon as I tried it on, I knew it would probably be one of my favorite articles of clothing because of how soft and nice it was... so I went for it and I'm glad I did.\n\nAs far as coffee/food:\nI've ordered the cortado a few times, and it is quality, delicious coffee. I have become a bit of a coffee snob since moving to the city, and it didn't disappoint!

This place fits all the requirements and more!\n\n-$4.00 matcha latte  -- made without sweetener but you can add your own simple syrup (which I love bc sometimes places make it TOO sweet); they make it with almond milk which is super light and doesn't change the taste at all\n\n-$2.70 chocolate chip cookie -- biggest chocolate chip cookie ever with even BIGGER chunks of chocolate; i think they are semi-sweet/dark chocolate chunks. DELICIOUS! \n\n-wifi -- good, fast and easy\n\n-hours -- on the weekends, they open at 8am and close at 7pm. on the weekdays, they open at 7am and close at 7pm. ample time to do work. \n\n-atmosphere -- bright windows and great lighting; mixture of areas to sit in (people eating meals together, people doing work on their computers, people sitting on some couches and enjoying a drink together); not super crowded so it's easy to get work done; music is light enough to focus\n\n-water (still and sparkling) on tap!! love this \n\nlove this place for all the reasons above, PLUS they compost and are very sustainable/eco-friendly. it's also a part-store that sells what seems to be a lot of hiking gear. super cool place. would defs return!", "date": "2019-02-03 21:32:28", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 141, "average_stars": 4.15, "yelping_since": "2014-06-27 22:39:24"}}

There's no shortage of coffee shops around this part of town that are great for doing work in and have great cups of coffee, but what's great about United by Blue is that it also has a great menu of food options, both suitable for breakfast and lunch, and there is almost always seating available since the space is so large. I love coming here to study and to work, as I've noticed many people do, but on weekends it's also a great place to stop for brunch. \n\nIn terms of drinks, I've tried most of their menu and everything is great depending on your mood. They have awesome hot and iced coffees, and they serve a great matcha latte. They also have a free water fountain with both still and sparkling water which is clutch. Regarding food, I've also tried most of the menu and have loved everything. I love making my own egg sandwich for breakfast, their salads are great for lunch, and for weekend brunch my go-to is usually the eggs benedict. Lastly, make sure you try their chocolate chip cookies and ask for them warmed up; they are to die for!\n\nBesides the food, they also have great clothing options that I have gotten for both myself and as gifts. They also strive for sustainability and promote recycling, and have the pounds of trash they have recycled updated on their wall. Overall, I come here on average three times per week, and I could t ask for a better coffee shop to live next to!", "date": "2019-01-18 18:31:21", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 109, "average_stars": 4.52, "yelping_since": "2017-06-24 21:36:30"}}
