They are also cash only, but there's an ATM located at the bottom of the steps.\n\nThe drop has an incredible selection of sandwiches including egg salad, tuna, bagels with lox, and an avocado and red pepper sandwich that is just divine!

The only serious problem, besides the female counter jerk, is the inexcusable fact that the cafe doesn't wash its corpse-like garbage smell off the sidewalk where its tables are placed.

The radio is usually on a little too loud, you have the obligatory coffee house noises, but once you get a table or two of people talking in the place, it becomes nearly impossible to get work done (again, grad school so this was important) even with earphones.

Clearly I'm not in the \"in\" crowd or a friend of the joint because the baristas seemed annoyed that I even placed an order. I remember seeing a posted note that someone wrote to them on the wall saying something to the effect of \"stay tastefully snobby!\" which is probably bad advice. It isn't as if they were being downright rude to me, they just were not at all warm and welcoming. \n\nNext, I've had a coffee, a mocha and a latte, all three were subpar. I mean, I'm a picky bitch when it comes to coffee but so many shops make a good cup in the city, it hits me like a brick when I don't get it. Perhaps my taste is maladjusted because my clothes aren't rag-taggy enough or my shoes and socks aren't disjointed and zooty, I'm not really sure. \n\nMy next gripe (which isn't a direct knock on the joint but obviously it attracts them in throngs) is the clientele. Sure, I like a diverse crowd, but there always seemed to be at least one asshole just too close to me no matter where I sat. I actually sat outside for one visit because it was a nice day. Two women where behind me, sucking face and spreading their odors my direction.  I mean, it was a noisome hippy cloud of pure \"soap is too conformist\", but I got over it.  I couldn't care less that they were lesbian, and I could overlook the stink, but the conversation was the stake in the heart. I tried to drowned it out but I could hear the one over my headphones! Her conversation was so inane and just flat out ridiculous, I just couldn't focus on anything but her.  ( I feel sorry for her girlfriend, she seemed nice). \n\nSo, what really got me about the place? The first time I went I lugged my computer and planned on staying for at least an hour to get some work done. It was old so it didn't hold a charge.

They don't want people just hanging out.\" Sweet Jesus, really? I went up to ask if they would turn the power on and they kindly said no.

It's bizarre that people spend so much time hanging out at these places.  I'm baffled by the logic that the purchase of a $2 cup of coffee entitles one to sit at a place of business for an entire day.   \n\nI'm surprised you don't hear more stories about frustrated baristas gutting the shiftless lay-abouts that sit around all day and don't even have the common decency to put a single dollar in the tip jar.  I admire their patience because if I were in their shoes, I'd be decapitating beret-bedecked domes on the regular.\n\nLast Drop seems to suffer from an overabundance of self-righteous, look-at-me tool boxes.  I'm hard pressed to determine whether their loitering is for genuine enjoyment or some sort of performance art...a modern-day street theater.\n\nThe other weekend I stopped by the Drop (as the cool kids call it) to drink an iced coffee, sit outside with my dog, and enjoy a beautiful Saturday morning.\n\nSadly, relaxation and peace of mind were not in the cards.  Sitting directly behind me was arguably the most annoying person I've encountered in Philadelphia...an unemployed lesbian with a crew cut.  \n\nUpon sitting, I was immediately subjected to the pleasure of listening to her explain her career philosophy.  She does freelance work to make money, but she doesn't do too much because then she won't be eligible for unemployment.  Terrific.  \n\nIt's so inspiring to hear about a person so consciously manufacturing a mediocre existence.  There was a time when the American dream meant working your hardest to achieve your goals, to elevate yourself in society.  Apparently, in the age of the entitled, that dream has died...to be replaced with nothing more than a desire to simply get by with the least amount of effort.  Her parents must be so proud.\n\nAs if this unabashed, unashamed, public explanation of her utter patheticness wasn't painful enough, she didn't even pause to take a breath before launching into a tirade about the rationale behind her hatred of Brokeback Mountain.  I literally broke into tears.  \n\nI sobbed like I haven't sobbed since Elliott reached his hand out to ET, looked into his eyes, resolved himself to save his best friend, and began ripping off his heart monitors while screaming, \"Leave him alone!  You're killing him!\"\n\nI love the coffee here, but going to Last Drop makes me wish that people were more self-aware.  Is that too much too ask?  From the fat business woman on the train discussing her work duties loudly so as to convince me that she is a serious person and not just a revolting slob to the disaffected youth performing a dramatic street corner pout, I just have a simple request...leave me alone...I don't care about you....", "date": "2010-07-16 14:00:26", "useful": 6, "funny": 13, "cool": 5, "user": {"review_count": 32, "average_stars": 4.11, "yelping_since": "2009-04-22 22:26:17"}}

Pretty standard greeting no problems here.\n\nWith my assumption I was correct she was still setting up things. I ordered a coffee but I failed to realize there was a 3$ limit. She apologized & thanks me for understanding as I grabbed an bakes item to hit the card limit. The barista didn't really pay any mind as I signed and didn't offer a receipt... I had to say thank you in order for her to a knowledge me. I was also not offered a receipt. That left a sour taste. That's a star gone unfortunately.\n\nI took away a half stars because there wasn't any sugar, and the sugar in the raw was quite old to the point it didn't come out of the container and was clumped together.

Please note that any dialogue or personal thoughts portrayed here, though stylistically portrayed, is truthful and completely honest. \n\nScene 1:\nI entered The Last Drop Coffee House on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Bright light permeated this warm and inviting coffee shop through large windows. A quaint row of beautiful white marble tables, spacious benches, and comfortable chairs greeted me, as I approached the counter.\n\nScene 2:\nMe: \"I would like a small iced tea please.\"\nBarista: \"One sec... [Checks under counter for long period of time] Unfortunately, we have no iced tea here. Someone didn't do their job.\"\nMe: \"....um. Small latte, perhaps\"\n\nScene 3:\nBarista: That will be $13.\nMe: [Looks at small latte, looks at small sandwich. Looks at menu and tries to decipher confusing, poorly marked prices on menu. Figured out sandwich is $7.50. Could not figure out how a small latte could be $5.50, even with tax.]\n\nScene 4:\nI was informed that the restroom was downstairs. Descending the stairs, I found another seating area. This one starkly contrasted the airy room above. The walls and ATM machine were scrawled with graffiti (unclear if it was the artistic kind, but if it was, it was most definitely not aesthetically pleasing). The entire basement was unlit, dark, and dreary. I found the bathroom with some effort, at first mistaking it for a broom closet (it was impossible to see what was in there as it was completely pitch black). After fumbling for a light switch, I was able to light one very, very sad brown lightbulb to find a graffiti scrawled bathroom....\n\nI could barely see the toilet, there were no paper towels, and if my memory serves me right, no toilet paper as well...\n\nScene 5:\nReading a book, I heard one barista complaining to another in the background:\n\nBarista: \"******* shift is so long, 2 more hours.\"\n\n[5 minutes later]\n\nBarista: \"I can't wait for this shift to be over.\"\n\n[5 minutes later]\n\nBarista: \"Thank god, I get off in 2 hours.

I only stopped in because I wanted to check it out as a possible future place to eat breakfast and grab a quick sandwich for work. Also, I order sandwiches and pastries, for monthly meetings I have so I thought this could be a good place to meet that need as well.\nFast forward to today's occurrence. I walked in, it was a blonde chick and an African American male standing chatting, nothing odd about that. I said good morning, and they responded accordingly. I was checking out the sandwich display when another lady walked in. I informed her to go ahead in front of me since I was not ready to order. The man walked away as the blonde took the woman's order. Once she finished with the lady, she saw that I was still looking and said there is a menu over there. I said thanks and walked over to where she pointed to look at the menu. I returned and ordered the egg and cheese sandwich. She said what are you having it on? I replied an Everything Bagel. Her tone was curt, not friendly. So I said let it pass maybe it's me. Then I looked at the sandwich display still thinking maybe this would be a close enough spot from work to hang out for lunch. However, I quickly changed my mind since the blond's tone didn't change. I asked while she was preparing my sandwich are these sandwiches made fresh to order? She said, excuse me or something to that order so I repeated the question. She responded they are already made, we make them. I asked, you make them in the morning? She responded yes. All questions I asked the tattooed blond woman were answered in a monotone voice with no interest on expounding . Needless to say, I will not be visiting that establishment again neither to satisfy  personal or business needs.\nThe blonde's response may not be a big deal to you; however, for me, it is important for any establishment that I spend my hard earned money at to demonstrate good social skills by being courteous and, professional. I don't care if you are pretending, I do desire the business employee or owners to make an effort to be social. \nNow about the sandwich, nothing special about it: I took a bite or two, and for me, it is too much egg. Also, I like my bagel toasted and not simply warmed as she prepared it for me. When I asked her to toast it, she replied it's toasted. I removed all the egg, and I am left with a piece of turkey like the turkey meat I purchase from the deli, cheddar cheese, and an Everything Bagel. Once I finish this review, I am going into the breakroom at my office to toast the Bagel the way I like it and will heat up this one piece of deli turkey. I paid $6.48.
