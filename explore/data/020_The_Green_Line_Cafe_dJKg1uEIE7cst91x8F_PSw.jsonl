I've had better experiences there in the past, but these past three visits were all 2-star visits at best.\n\nVisit 1: I order a large iced mocha and a Banana Nutella muffin. The barista goes out of her way to warn me that a large iced mocha has 4 shots of espresso in it, instead of just 2. I tell her I can handle it. She continues to ask me if \"I'm sure\" because that's \"a lot of coffee.\" My friend overhears and asks me, \"Did that barista just shame you about how much coffee you want?\" At least the muffin was good. \n\nVisit 2: I order a small iced mocha (for here) and a (vegan) Raspberry Almond Oat muffin. The barista tells me they're out of chocolate, so I change my order to a small iced chai. The barista hands me a tall glass. He didn't even bother to stir the chai concentrate and the milk together. There is milk dripping down the side of the glass. All I taste is milk and licorice. The muffin was barely edible. Super gummy like someone (unsuccessfully) tried to compress a soggy bowl of granola into bread form. Never again. \n\nVisit 3: This was the day after Visit 2. I tried again to order a small iced mocha, but (a different) barista said they were still out of chocolate. I get a small iced coffee (for here) and a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Muffin. The coffee was a million times better than the chai, but there was no simple syrup. The \"egg\" on the muffin looked like tofu and the bacon was \"ham\" without a lot of flavor. I was expecting real bacon and eggs, so I was pretty disappointed. I ate about half of it before I tossed it. \n\nI'll probably be back for coffee with friends since the location is so convenient, but I'll probably stick to coffee and bagels.", "date": "2016-09-08 12:50:42", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 3, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2013-05-10 12:46:47"}}

The Vietnamese hoagies are decent, but not very filling.  \n\nMost importantly, the coffee is bad.  Bad coffee at a cafe is a dealbreaker for me.  Also they tend to keep the little carton of soy milk sitting out on the counter all day instead of refrigerating it, so it usually has a funny taste.  \n\nThey do have a large selection of loose teas, which they keep in big canisters behind the counter and scoop out for you into a homemade tea-bag thing when you order a cup.  They put a lot of tea in there, so you can get a free refill of hot water and have a very flavorful second cup. \n\nIn fact, if they marketed themselves as a tea place and didn't sell coffee at all, I'd probably give them 3 or 4 stars.

I wish that they'd just not offer wireless--it's like, don't serve a dish if you don't know how to cook it so that it's at least palatable.  If the wireless were a dish of food, it would be something that I had to throw out half the time, because it just doesn't work half the time.  I love community-based coffee shops that aren't just a bunch of people plugging away on their laptops, so I would support the idea of this place going without wifi.  I just resent it being advertised as wifi, and me planning coming here to use the internet, only to find I can't use it at all.\n\nI like the ambiance here.  This place is on a corner, on a slight hill, placing the seating a bit below the level of the street.  This, combined with the big glass windows, gives you the odd but somewhat cool effect of looking up and out into the neighborhood, which is a quirky hodgepodge of nicely kept and more run-down buildings, always populated by interesting people.\n\nThis place serves good baked goods, and good tea, which is what I drink.  The tea is actually from the company Divinitea, and is pretty good; I have begun reviewing some of it, and you can find the reviews (or write your own if you so desire) on my interactive tea rating site:\n\nhttp://ratetea.net/brand/divinitea/248/\n\nSome of the employees here have been nice.  Some of them have seemed cold and detached, or snippy at times though.  I used to frequent Cafe Clave, and I wouldn't exactly call the employees warm and fuzzy people there, but I found them to be friendly on a deep level.  I never got like, a genuinely uncomfortable vibe from them.  Sometimes I have gotten the vibe here that the people seem irritated with me or with other customers, for some unknown reason--I've never seen a customer being difficult.  I don't know if there's something about the way they set up the shifts that causes the employees to become too stressed or what...but the employees here often seem run down or snippy.  I have noticed, what other people remark, about them sometimes being over-eager to kick people out before closing time--maybe it's juts giving a heads up so people have time to wrap up, but it sometimes seems a bit abrasive.  It's not what they say, it's how they say it.\n\nOne time I lost my temper at an employee here.  I'm not proud of it and it's more my issue than his, but I still think the way he was acting towards me was disrespectful; I had a not-particularly-important remark about the soap in the restroom, and I approached him about it and was very respectful and positive about how I brought it up with him, but he kept persistently interrupting me telling me he didn't have any control over it, without even hearing what I had to say.  It just seemed really rude because in like, 99% of my other interactions I've had in life in other businesses, when I've brought up a concern, people have at least listened to what I had to say, and they usually acknowledge it or say they'll say something to a manager instead of interrupting me and saying that I need to contact the management about it on my own.  I know others don't always have the same social norms for interactions, but I personally am very hesitant to interrupt a customer offering a suggestion or complaint, and the way the employee interacted with me struck me as dismissive and abrasive, and really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nThe music is eclectic...some days I love it, other times I'm a little less excited...but it's never generic.\n\nThe wireless here is notoriously unreliable.  Some days it works fine, most days it is spotty, sometimes it doesn't work at all.  I don't know what their issue is...the signal strength is strong.  I think their router can't handle the volume of traffic in the store, personally.  But that's not my issue to work out--it's theirs--and it already hurts their business because I don't come here as often as I otherwise would.\n\nIf it weren't for the spotty wireless and my awkward interactions with some of the employees, this would probably be my favorite coffee shop not only in West Philly, possibly in all of Philadelphia.  As-is, I usually only come here to hang out, or for a break, usually if other people suggest to come here, but I don't ever come here if I actually need internet.", "date": "2011-09-08 17:01:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 629, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2007-05-03 21:52:54"}}

New Wave music in the background. 30% of the crowd were on laptops. Half of the crowd were in small groups, appearing to be studying or discussing high-intellect topics. The tables are all varied, and though not necessarily practical or ideal, they work and there's a lot of seating space.\n\nI'll probably end up going back, either for a reading, or to do some writing/newspaper browsing. Yes, it's that kind of place.", "date": "2008-12-01 05:17:25", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 95, "average_stars": 3.86, "yelping_since": "2008-07-12 03:43:44"}}

It's not that I don't like hipsters.  I mean, some of my best friends are hipsters, etc. etc.  But Green Line is just ridiculous. It's where hipsters send their hipster friends that they're too embarrassed to hang out with because of how effin' hipster they are. The too-hipster-to-hang-out-with-other-hipsters-hipsters come here, meet other too-hipster-to-be-a-hipster-hipsters, drink lousy coffee, ride their homemade bikes home, and make little environmentally-friendly hipster babies.\n\nSo. Hipsters. Just so long as we're clear.\n\nClientele aside, there are a host of things that annoy me about Green Line.  First and foremost, the coffee is lousy.  It's a weird combination of burned- and watery-tasting that just isn't good.  At a coffee shop, this is a deal breaker.  Second issue, and this is a personal pet peeve, is the bagel situation. When you order a bagel with cream cheese, you receive a (barely toasted) Lenders-esque bagel, a pod of cream cheese, and a knife.  IMHO, to be a good cafe, your cream cheese should come out of a vat. Less wasted plastic pods, more cream cheese on my bagel, minimal extra work for baristas. Third issue. Cash only, and their ATM is often broken. Taking credit cards is *not that hard,* people.\n\nA few things in their favor (?) include vegan baked goods, expensive prepackaged Vietnamese hoagies, and gluten-free stuff. It's great if you're into that kind of thing.", "date": "2011-04-11 02:06:31", "useful": 6, "funny": 16, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 89, "average_stars": 3.55, "yelping_since": "2011-01-09 17:06:38"}}

When I decided not to, he made a very snarky and sarcastic comment and said \"Thanks for that. I live off of tip but no big deal.\" I was actually about to leave a tip in cash but after that comment and attitude, absolutely not. I watched as he did the same thing towards other customers. The barista also purposefully blasted the music after I sat down, which was very petty and childish. \n\nThe barista created an extremely uncomfortable and hostile environment. Tipping is not obligatory and customers can choose whether or not to tip and how much. I understand the frustrations that come with working in the food service industry. But if you treat customers as rude as you did, not only will you not be tipped but you turn people away from your store. You're turning away people who can potentially become regulars and big-tippers. \n\nBesides the rude employee, the mocha I ordered was very watery and I barely tasted the espresso. My friend also said her coffee was super sour and it wasn't drinkable. She drank half of it and couldn't finish the drink. \n\nI read through other Yelp reviews and apparently this isn't the first time that this happened at the store-- multiple different employees have received comments for being rude when a customer decides not to tip. This was an incredibly disappointing experience and I won't be coming back unless there's a drastic change in the employee's attitudes.", "date": "2019-10-26 15:36:03", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 160, "average_stars": 4.02, "yelping_since": "2019-08-10 18:26:15"}}

That's why I was doubly happy to here that Green Life was opening a new cafe on Locust, and That Sherman Arts was going to start booking shows there exclusively.\n\nI've been hearing about the new cafe since a couple months before it's inception and finally stopped in to check it out on Monday. So far so good. It worked out all of the kinks that it's previous spot on Locust used to have, and kept all of the good stuff. The old cafe used to get cramped and packed in rather quickly. But this spot has outdoor seating, church pews to sit on, and plenty of wide open space. In a way it felt a little too wide open, so maybe they could get a few more tables in. But it's still a great spot to get some work done on your laptop while chowing down lon a vegan chicken salad sandwich.\n\nRich Wexler and Sherman Arts has been putting on some amazing shows all around Philly for years. You might have seen some previous events at The Rotunca, and The Trocadero, or while helping out with events like Best Fest in Clark Park. So the fact that it's putting a lot of that behind them in order to focus exclusively on bringing shows to the Green Line really says something. and it should hopefully bring in a lot of acts who haven't previously playing in The West Philly scene.", "date": "2008-06-03 23:44:18", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 1512, "average_stars": 4.17, "yelping_since": "2007-07-13 04:00:59"}}
