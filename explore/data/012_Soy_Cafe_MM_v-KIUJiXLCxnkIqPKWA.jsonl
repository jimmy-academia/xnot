I have horrible food allergies and an extremely restricted diet.  I initially went to Soy Cafe way back when because of their name figuring it was a place I could find some good vegan food.\n\nWhen I saw that the menu included TWENTY TWO smoothies made with soy milk and honey I was so happy.  I am a huge smoothie fan!  My favorite smoothie is the Milk Vanilla:  peach, banana, vanilla, soy milk, honey.  Note for vegans who don't eat honey:  good maple syrup is available to substitute.  I always get the soy protein add-on.  It makes the smoothie richer and creamier (thus yummier).  :)  The Milk Vanilla + soy protein became my favorite smoothie of all time upon first sip.  I've been ordering this smoothie for over 5 years on a regular basis and have been impressed by the consistency shown by the staff.  They always make it the same way every time:  just right.  Highly recommend coming here for your smoothie fix!\n\nAnd there's more!  :)\n\nThe salads are phenomenal.  Very generously sized and brimming with perfect, delicious, extremely fresh veggies (and fruit in some!).  My favorite is the Avocado Grapefruit Salad...even though I can't have grapefruit.  The staff is always happy to substitute apples, oranges, or another fruit of my choice.  This salad comes with a bed mixed field greens, a sliced avocado, grapefruit, thin long curly tendrils of crisp carrots and beets, sliced cucumber, sliced tomato, and a generous sprinkling of toasted almonds.  This salad also might come with peppers and onions but I can't have those so I always ask for those to be held.  The dressing is house made fresh from scratch daily.  It's an apple carrot ginger dressing that is amazing!\n\nIf you are going to enjoy a hot tea I highly recommend the Green Tea with Roasted Rice.  The roasted rice gives the green tea a light nutty note that is particularly lovely.  It pairs especially well with one of the Sweet Toasts:  Honey Nut (sliced bananas, toasted almond chips, honey) or the Elvis Special (sliced bananas and peanut butter).  Choices of bread include Russian Black, whole wheat, and multigrain.  Tea is served by the pot or the cup if you stay - I prefer to get the pot.  It's definitely not too much for one person if you're planning to take your time and relax.  It's great for 2 people as well.\n\nThe Vanilla Oatmeal with honey soy milk is phenomenal.  I know, it's just oatmeal but...wow.  I got it one morning on a whim and was like, this is the best oatmeal I have ever had EVER.  It's just...so, so good.  Perfect comfort breakfast on a rainy morning!\n\nSoy Cafe also offers some really unique coffee drinks.  For an especially indulgent treat I love the Espresso Milkshake (shot of espresso, 2 scoops of soy ice cream, soy milk, honey)!  It's decadent, delicious, and perfect for a hot day.  The Vanilla Java (shot of espresso, vanilla, cinnamon, soy milk, honey) tastes exotic.  I prefer this drink hot but you can choose to have it served cold, blended with ice.  The Mocha-cha-cha (shot of espresso, cocoa, soy milk, honey) has just the right amount of cocoa in it - it's like hot chocolate and espresso had a baby!  Yum.  All coffee is Fair Trade organic.  Inquire about specific varieties.\n\nThe Soy Special Drinks have some big winners too.  The Soy Chai has harmonious, balanced notes that come together with the soy milk perfectly.  Nothing is overdone (I really hate too much cinnamon or too much clove, yuck!).  The Cocoa Mint Soy is like a Girlscout's Thin Mint in beverage form.  Yum!\n\nThere are always freshly baked vegan and non-vegan treats at the counter.  They are kept separate from each other which someone like me with food allergies really appreciates.  :)  Baked goods vary by the day but there are muffins (gluten free sometimes!), chocolate chip cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and more.  There are even mini cupcakes and muffins so if you are trying to keep to a diet you can still have a little something sweet with your coffee/tea/etc.  And they are just so cute!  :)  My favorites are the cupcakes.  Ahhh, so moist and such yummy frosting!\n\nAnd there is so much more:  wraps, homemade soy milk, fresh squeezed veggie & fruit juices, soups, sandwiches...  I could go on forever, lol!\n\nThe staff is always super friendly and helpful.  The decor is charming and welcoming.  The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  There is free unlimited wifi.  Go solo, go with your other half, go with a group of friends - this cafe is great for grabbing a quick bite or hanging out for a while.  There is even a little outdoor garden!\n\nI really love Soy Cafe.  I can't say enough great things about this wonderful place!  If you don't live nearby it's worthy of making a special trip there.  Plus there is plenty to do in NoLibs after you've had your fill at Soy Cafe, especially on N 2nd Street right where Soy Cafe is located.

Quite a cozy spot on 2nd and Fairmount, never too crowded, and a pretty extensive veggie/vegan menu. So far I've had:\n\n--Tomato and Avocado Sandwhich on Wheat, which is a nice option for light lunch but enough to fill you up if you're not a big eater. Also served with a salad and a homemade dressing which is fantastic.\n-- Miso + Steamed Dumplings - This was incredible. Great miso broth, served in a very large bowl with I think around 6 dumplings, which are also quite excellent. Will order that again for sure. \n-- Seitan Cheesesteak Wrap - I had to try this to see what it was all about. I've seen it as the special every time I go in there, figure lots of people are ordering it, and now I can see why. I like their wraps because there's a full salad in there. I cut mine up so getting bits of the wrap, salad, and seitan on a fork full is a perfect bite. Not too heavy which was my initial concern. Their honey mustard dressing is also to die for. Wish there was a little bit more of that for extra dipping. \n-- BBQ Pork Wrap - Tried this yesterday. Not bad.. I think I liked the seitan cheesesteak wrap better, but worth trying if you're looking to sample veggie proteins. \n\nThe food is a perfect veggie lunch and is also prepared and served in a way I can respect. Decent portion, home made, and overall has a certain care for the way it's put on the plate. I also like coming here because because of the atmosphere. It's quiet, friendly, and comfortable.

I'm not one to get filled up on mush but one Black Banana smoothie (bananas, cocoa, soymilk, peanut butter, oats, and maple syrup instead of honey) and I'm not hungry for hours. It's decadent and rich and very addictive. \n\n* Service is friendly and not snooty and apathetic like some other cafes that are in No Libs/Fishtown-area.\n\n* Good assortment of vegan baked goodies.\n\n* I also love their stash of current mags they have on hand.\n\nCONS: Here is why I can't give Soy Cafe 4 or 5 stars\n\n* One of the  vegan brownies I had was crumbly and flavorless. I believe most of their vegan baked goods come from North Port Fishington, which are always yummy, but whoever supplies the brownies (not North Port) needs to tweak the recipe.\n\n* I've ordered food twice. Bagel and hummus was alright. Tofu sesame salad was wholesome but the tofu is not flavored or cooked. I LOVE tofu--I even pop a plain, uncooked piece in my mouth while cooking--but a heaping plateful of plain tofu is not appetizing (I doubt a plateful of raw chicken on greens would be much better!). \n\n* This is my biggest caveat about the place. I never noticed until yesterday that the amount I was charged for two smoothies seemed off. . I calculated the price myself and realized they round up after adding tax and it is quite significant. My order, with tax, should have been $8.53, but they charged me $8.60. They don't use a cash register or offer receipts. I find this practice very dishonest (Golden Chopsticks on Spring Garden does this too) and if you multiply this by all the customers they serve each day, that's quite a markup. They should price their menu so that, with tax, the prices are a round number or they should stop this practice.\n\nI'll think twice about coming back now that I'm aware of the price hike and I'll mention it next time.

Soy Cafe finally gave me something worth writing about.  My family and I stopped by here for an early dinner after a day at the Zoo and our expectations were far exceeded.  It's a cute place, with cozy seating and very friendly staff.  They were setting up for some big event in the back when we came in but stopped everything to wait on us.\n\nOn to the food-- I had the grilled eggplant on multigrain toast, hold the soy cheese.  This sandwich was far beyond what I expected from a little corner cafe.  The eggplant was done just right (not mushy), the toast was just crusty enough without being too crunchy (and the bread itself was this absolutely delicious multigrain that I'm already craving again).  The best thing was the homemade soy mayo, though, which added a fantastic tang to the sandwich.  I probably could have eaten a shoe dipped in that stuff.  The portion was a perfect size, too-- big enough to be satisfying without being excessive.  Plus it comes with an ample (and aesthetically-pleasing) side salad with a tasty house made dressing.\n\nMy folks got the turkey pesto sandwich and the bella burger on multigrain, respectively, and both raved about their meals as well.  They also shared a berry berry smoothie and loved it (I sipped a chamomile).  At the end of the meal, we also snagged some vegan & wheat-free brownies to go and devoured them later (so chocolatey and decadent - couldn't believe they were vegan!)\n\nTo sum up, this place was fantastic.

She even came over with a bag for our items(when we were putting our stuff in a takeout wrapper).\n \nSoy Cafe has an awesome seating arrangement and they have some very nifty reading material. These are not your average magazines =). \n\nOh and the food. The vegan cinnamon buns were so good looking that  my boyfriend (omnivore) actually got (and ate) one. Yes, one; he ate one! And so did I, so I can say that they were VERY good: soft, just the right amount of cinnamon, and the icing was \"lick your fingers good.\" She asked if we wanted them \"for here,\" and we said sure (she warmed them up for us =) ). We also got them out of the wrapper and on to a plate. \nThe banana nut (homemade) muffin was really good too: tasty and moist. Again, she asked if I wanted it warmed up, but I got it to go.\n\nThey also have some of my favorite drink options: water (Fuji), Viva coconut water!, bubbly lemonade, aloe vera (why is spell check saying vera is spelled wrong? Ohhh there is goes again, and it just did it again for o + three \"geez\") juice and some teas --- as well as other options.\n\nWhat else am I forgetting? Oh and I should have asked myself that before leaving. We get down the street and I go \"I want the vegan ham and cheese\" *sad face,*\" so my boyfriend told me to just get it. I walked back in feeling a little weird that I didn't make up my mind the first time, but they are so sweet and friendly here that my weird feeling went out the door, and I ordered up a vegan ham and cheese! I got it to go, and by the time we got on the El, I wanted to try some (I know there are germs, but it smelled so good). I opened it up and almost freaked out because the vegan ham looked so real! I thought I was given the wrong order possibly (the woman in front of me ordered sandwiches too). But a Google search later, I realized some vegan ham is super thick. (Oh and my boyfriend also tried it.) It was awesome. Super thick cut, taste almost like the real thing, awesome dressing, toasty wheat bread (you have an option of the type of bread) and a side salad. \n\n5 Stars for Soy Cafe (next time I'm going to try a smoothie; everyone was coming in for them).

Our neighborhood wasn't always that way, and so it is the case with where Soy Cafe resides. It really helps to have an open mind in life when you try anything that's new to you, and no restaurant can make everyone happy. \n\nI have friends in Philly and make the trip down there from time to time and the Soy Cafe gives me a chance to to stay on track with my mostly vegetarian diet. \n\nSoy Cafe reminds me of New York in the 70's and 80's, when it comes to decor. The old vintage look has plenty of character, and as long as you're comfortable in an old world, casual setting, you'll feel right at home there. Today there are too many food and beverage chains, so to me this is a nice place that fits somewhere between an old pharmacy and a really old bar. What I like most is that it's a very laid back place that has tasteful accents. \n\nThe folks who work there are mostly friendly and courteous, one shouldn't expect the kind of service that many more traditional restaurants have. That said, they get the job done and most importantly are community oriented folks. So as long as you have reasonable expectations from a very minimal staff service wise, you'll be just fine with it. \n\nI've had wraps, sandwiches, salads and deserts. Coming from New York, I find the pricing to be very reasonable, but of course that is relative. The food is fresh and quite good. The Semi Philly styled wrap was very tasty, and the salad I've had was quite a complete offering, which really hit the spot. I'm used to vegan deserts, and these deserts ( ex. Chocolate Cup Cakes) are fresh home baked and are up there with the best of them. I do find that one does have to acquire a taste for these newer vegan recipees, but once you do, it seems as natural as anything else that you've had. \n\nHaving worked in restaurants on and off for a bit over 20 years, I can see that Soy Cafe has a wonderful potential to become a highly appreciated and successful restaurant in it's community. I just think more people who are into vegetarian food, fish and noodles need to know about the place. \n\nI applaud all the hard work that has gone into putting this place together, and sincerely hope you get a chance to try some different dishes so you can get a better idea of what is offered there.

The Berry Berry is my favorite.  There is just something about Soy Cafe's homemade soy milk in the smoothies that makes them about 100 times better than anything I can make in my kitchen.

My second favorite is the grilled eggplant, either on black Russian toast or in a wrap.

I was asking a lot of questions because I'm picky when it comes to my drinks. I don't like them sweetened, a certain kind of milk etc. the girl behind the counter seemed annoyed. I went with a steeped chai tea latte and she said it wasn't sweetened but when I received my drink it was too sweet and she said they sweeten it with brown sugar. Annoyed that I paid $5 for something I wouldn't drink any more of I asked to return it for a regular tea. The girl continued to be rude and act annoyed and gave me my tea without offering me my money back for the difference. There are definitely better coffee shops around and I probably won't be returning here.", "date": "2015-03-16 02:59:51", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 132, "average_stars": 3.73, "yelping_since": "2013-06-18 05:01:37"}}

I mean, yeah, I'll probably go back, mostly for the convenience.  Their menu has a lot of variety, especially for a healthy-diet kind of restaurant.  Their sandwiches and wraps are all pretty delicious, albeit pretty overpriced for what they are, and serving sizes leave a lot to be desired.  I mean, really, is throwing an extra handful of veggies on that rice paper that cost you $0.01 but you're charging extra on top of the sandwich price for, really hurting your bottom line?\n\nThe smoothies are hit-or-miss, sometimes made with way too much ice which makes them slushy and flavorless, but usually pretty delicious, I'd say 7/10 visits.  Most seem to be around $6.00, which I think is still overpriced, but fair for the area.\n\nThe staff are the only thing that I could consistently complain about.  For whatever reason, almost every staff member I've dealt with here, over years, has been less than friendly.  Sometimes, downright rude, ignoring me as I stand at the counter smiling and waiting for service for 5 minutes or more. I understand you might be busy slicing fruit and unable to help right away, but a smile back and acknowledgement of my presence instead of a cold glance and returning to your conversation with your coworker would be nice.", "date": "2018-02-23 19:41:06", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 5, "average_stars": 2.4, "yelping_since": "2018-01-31 02:10:34"}}

I'm not a vegetarian, so anything with \"Soy\" in the name makes me a bit nervous - but people around the office seemed to like it, so I decided to take a shot. I've stopped back about a half dozen times, and have been happy every time. I usually wind up with the Nova on a croissant. It's a bit pricey, coming in at nearly $10, but it's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and I'm a lover of sandwiches. The Philadelphia Wrap is another one to write home about - Smoked salmon, homemade soy mayo, cucumbers, caviar, some sort of greens and I'm pretty sure I found some capers in there too. *VERY* good. \n\nThe only thing stopping me from giving them a 5 is that they don't take credit cards - once or twice I've been in there and not remembered that, and had to run down to Palm Tree Market to use their ATM machine. Last time I was there though, there was a sign saying they now have an ATM in back, so that might fix the problem. Really though, I'd prefer they just took credit cards. I haven't carried cash around with me in years, and there are more than a few times that I've passed up going to Soy Cafe in favor of somewhere that takes cards. I'd really rather give my money to Soy Cafe though.\n\nI have pictures of the Nova, Spicy Tuna Wrap, and Philadelphia Wrap here:\nhttp://www.thisiswhatimeating.com/tag/soy-cafe/", "date": "2010-08-04 14:46:26", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 18, "average_stars": 4.2, "yelping_since": "2010-08-02 16:28:46"}}

A cold, vegan treat...maybe ice cream or one of those brownie sundaes on the bottom of their menu. Unfortunately, they were out.\n\nInstead, I tried a chocolate donut and a Philly wrap. It pains me to say this, as I love when menus have vegan desserts, but this donut was truly inedible. I'm not sure if it was just old/stale, but I couldn't even finish! The Philly wrap was not bad, but was about as good as I can do...so not really worth the $ to me.\n\nThe atmosphere was a little dark and unapproachable to me, but I can see it being a nice hangout spot if you are reading.

I'm not from the area, so I drove about 45 minutes, struggled to find parking, but I was incredibly excited. I've been meaning to check this place out for a while, and I figured a safe bet was the vegan soft serve. They're always shoving it down your throat on ig, so I figured it HAD to be good. \n\nI've been craving soft serve all summer, and thought there was FINALLY a vegan soft serve option. I was dead ass wrong. \nWhatever the hell I was given was not even close. Being that they use oat milk, I assumed it would be creamy. The best way to describe it was cocoa powder water. It tasted like very watered down chocolate water ice. Thank god I paid (a whole ass dollar for like 6 chocolate chips lol) to add chocolate chips. The entire thing costed $7. And I thought paying $5 for a small at little baby's (at least they're actually good) was bad. \nMy boyfriend is a huge chocolate water ice fan so I figured he would like it, but he almost spit it out. \n\nDisappointed, I drove home, swerving all over 95 while eating my shitty soft serve that wasn't even worth risking my life for. Maybe Batter and Crumbs will be better.\n\nOh and the girl who was working as the cashier couldn't have been anymore dry and unfriendly if she tried.

We ordered at the counter and waited for the food to be brought to us. The menu was huge and was excited to order. However, the cashier/waiter wasn't too friendly. I didn't feel like asking her too many questions. \n\nMind you, the entire menu is vegan! There is no real cheese except soy cheese. We ordered the nachos (with \"edamame guac\" and \"soy cheese\") It was surprisingly not that bad. But then again, we were hangry so ate anything brought to us! It also had olives and scallions. The portion was enough as a small appetizer.\n\nThe MUSHROOM OMELETTE was fairly okay. It was topped with a generous portion of soy cheese and honey mustard dressing, which gave it a different yet slightly palatable flavor. A side salad accompanied it as well. We ended up forcing ourselves to finish the plate. Guess soy cheese makes you full!\n\nThe AMERICAN CHEESESTEAK wrap had soy flavored beef. The first bite takes you by total surprise but then it sort of grew on you! The BELLA BURGER WRAP basically was a whole lot of greens with large slices of portobello mushrooms. It was super plain and boring. Both the wraps were slightly disappointing. They both tasted similar towards the end, nothing stood out in them.\n\nI was eyeing the appetizing baked sweet treats on display, but after experiencing dinner I wasn't ready to be disappointed with dessert either.\n\nWe left feeling under-satisfied. Though the menu was quite extensive, I probably will not return, unless to try their extensive smoothie menu. 2 stars for the extensive menu and cute venue.", "date": "2018-03-21 16:09:20", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 136, "average_stars": 4.15, "yelping_since": "2015-04-05 23:13:08"}}

This would have been my sons first time trying something vegan. First I would like to say, there is a way you speak to ppl when you want something done. We were looking at the menu when a man (owner maybe) came in with supplies on a dolly. There is not much room so he asked if we can move aside. Nicely we tried to move when he then asked my son to go outside. Due to the COVID 19 I figured it was also bc too many ppl were in the restaurant, so I asked him were there a certain amount of ppl allowed to be in the restaurant. He walks away mocking me in the most arrogant manner. I told the man I was merely asking a question and it was not meant for him to be arrogant, so we left. The lady behind the cash register apologized. It was only my son and I in the restaurant and the way he asked my son to go outside. I felt as if he was throwing him out. I will never go back to this place again. I will be deleting my member account. This is not the only vegan restaurant around to order from.
