I brought my coffee snob friends from Pittsburgh here and not only did they buy a few pounds to take home, they joked they were thinking of moving back to Philly just for this place.\nThe espresso is always smooth and delicious, never burnt or bitter. And the tea. Holy hell, the tea selection here is crazy good. Black tea with coconut is the best thing I've ever tasted, and I'm not even a huge tea guy, but I buy a bag every couple weeks to keep the fridge stocked with iced tea.

Nice, open atmosphere. Freshly baked scones with delicious clotted cream and the Americano was superb - all at a reasonable price. AND they accept credit cards with a reliable wifi! As a grad student who gets the most work done at cafes early in the mornings, Steap and Grind appeared to be an awesome find.\n\nI came here around 8am on a weekday to get some work done. There was no one at the counter, but I saw that there was one patron sitting and getting some work done so I thought the barista must have just gone to the bathroom or something. \n\nEventually, he came out (I waited probably about 5 minutes), took my order. Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\n\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\n\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It's not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\n\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it's just coincidence.\n\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\n\nSeriously, this doesn't sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn't). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \n\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\n\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn't)\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\n- Maybe he doesn't like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\n\nRegardless. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because the scone and the coffee left my taste buds wanting for more. It is very plausible that today was just an off-day.

Coffee from Ithaca, NY) and both were very knowledgeable. It is hard to find a coffee shop these days that carries something other than La Colombe, and Gimme! is a worthy alternative. \n\nI typically only drink drip coffee, so I can't speak for the espresso or barrista skills, but the coffee is well made, fresh, and delicious. They boast a large selection of loose leaf teas, and brew times are monitored carefully and selected appropriate to the type of tea. I haven't tried the food, but the menu just has a few basic veggie sandwiches on bagels, nothing special. They promise more options in the future, but the kitchen is still in development. I found the prices to be quite reasonable, especially considering the quality of the coffee and tea. \n\nAs one reviewer said, the decor is a little sterile for Fishtown, it almost does kind of remind me of an airport or post office. The place is huge for a coffee shop, very modern and spread out. I suppose it is good if you don't like anyone sitting near you. It would be a great location for a jazz trio to play in the evening. A couple of couches with coffee tables would be a great addition here, and there is ample space. Still, the place is bright and welcoming with big windows and doors. \n\nSadly, I never see anyone in here. If you live in the area, please give this place a chance! I love it and I would hate to see it fail.", "date": "2013-12-21 19:30:51", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 8, "average_stars": 4.38, "yelping_since": "2011-12-17 18:20:19"}}

However... I love this place so much I have to give them some stars!!! \n\nI work down the street so I often stop by on my way to grab a coffee and a sandwich before work. Coffee is good, I'm not a person that is too picky about coffee so take that with a grain of salt but I enjoy it. I'm in for the caffeine. Is it a little overpriced? Of course, it's a coffee shop in Fishtown. The service is EXCELLENT. The staff are so kind and dealing with COVID very well. I'm guessing the people complaining haven't worked in the food service industry....especially during a global pandemic. \n\nBut anyways... the veggie sandwich.... I saw a complaint about it in another review and I am in shock, this sandwich is the greatest sandwich. It is the Queen of Sandwiches. It is my sun, moon and stars. I LOVE THIS SANDWICH. I don't care that it's $10, it keeps me coming back every time. It's so simple but the ingredients are SO fresh and well seasoned. I am ready to marry this sandwich. Please never get rid of it.

But as I entered within I discovered a caffeinated utopia of incredible coffees and loose leaf teas from around the world.\n\nWith all of the La Colombe, Saxby's, Counter Culture, and other well known brands of beans grinding throughout Philly its refreshing to see a coffeehouse using beans from a newer solid brand like Gimme Coffee. And whether you go drip, french press, or go fancy with an Americano or cafe au lait, it leads to some pretty refreshing coffees and espressos.  But with the amount of loose leaf tea houses depleting more and more in Philly I was especially sold on seeing a solid varieties from around the globe. And all of that oolong, green, and herbal teas can be picked up by the cup or in 2 or 4 oz bags.\n\nCaffeine isn't the only thing that delivers a win for a solid coffeehouse. And Steap & Grind also wins for being pretty large and providing plenty of good spots to read and work in. It also makes some pretty amazing sandwiches like the Melter Skelter with fig spread, and sharp cheddar melted on multi-grain bread (and with the option of adding prosciutto if you need that meat!).Add in plenty of baked goods and homemade scones and you have a win!", "date": "2017-04-15 07:28:33", "useful": 7, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 1512, "average_stars": 4.17, "yelping_since": "2007-07-13 04:00:59"}}

He order I believe a lite roast hot coffee and I ordered a small ice coffee. The granulated sugar they had was sugar in the raw.  I'm typically like this sugar but, in my hot coffee.  The coffee had a bit of a taste to it that wasn't to my liking.  Also, after some time my partners stomach then began to give him some issues. \n\nNow the interior was really nice.  They have a bunch of different flavored teas and even had different styles of tea, I believe I saw frap. tea. \nStaff was polite and pleasant while we were there. \n\nAs we were entering there was a customer exiting with her dog. I understand people/businesses are dog friendly and they don't want there pet owner customers to not be able to patron their business but...not everyone likes dogs. People may have trauma associated with dogs and could have an absolute fear of them, regardless of how much the owners tries to convince the other person how friendly there dog is.  I personally don't like to support businesses that allow dogs into their eater.

The lack of stars is for the sandwich. \n\nLook at the picture and see how thin the ingredients are. The only vegetables are cucumber and sprouts and not a lot of it. Sandwiched between a thin layer of hummus and avocado and what I'm assuming is very generic store bought bread. This would all be fine if it was $5 but for a $10 sandwich they should be doing better. \n\nMy recommendation is use this place for drinks and hit up philly style bagels for food, better food and slightly cheaper sandwiches (this is right across the street, you could throw a rock and hit it). OR depending on where you're coming from...Franny Lous, la Colombe, or Milkcrate are other similar priced coffee/cafe options but you get more for your $$$ there.", "date": "2020-06-30 15:01:56", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 256, "average_stars": 4.22, "yelping_since": "2013-08-16 19:44:22"}}
