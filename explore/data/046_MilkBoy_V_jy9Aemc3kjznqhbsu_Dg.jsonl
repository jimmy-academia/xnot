We asked the the waitress several times and she continued to tell us \"it's coming, it's coming\" Once we finally got our food it wasn't up to par. The fried chicken sandwich was way over fried. And one smoked bourbon turkey was ordered asking for chili mayonnaise on the side but the sandwich had mayo on it.

I don't think the waitress was trying to be rude, but was just slow and aloof. Finally the food comes, my one friend's burger is wrong.. my pork tacos ($13) were awful!

She ran down all the the beer subsitutions (and there were quite a few) and seemed to know what she was talking about with regard to the beer selection. We didn't have to wait long for service and our beers were delivered promptly. \n\nI ordered chips and salsa. Unfortunately they were sub-par but this isn't a mexican restaurant so I wasn't expecting a whole lot. Just a little something to fill my belly before I destoryed my liver at the Flyers game. Others got burritos, meatball veggie soup, etc. Everyone had kind of the same reaction to their food as I did to mine... it was just \"okay.\"   \n\nThe real issue I had was with the check. First, the check took forever. We were on the way to a Flyers game and were pressed for time. Second, when you advise of substitutions to your beer list you should also mention that said substitutions are not equal in price to the originals. The bill was a bit surprising because we were expecting that the $5 beer would have been substituted with another $5 beer -- not a $6 beer. Finally, when you take my money to ring me out please do so with some courtesy for my time. Taking the check and then chatting with your coworkers for 10+ minutes before you even get to the register with it is totally unacceptable. I am sure that conversation about your plans for after work could have waited 5 minutes while you rang me up and returned my credit card to me. \n\nSeems they have some kinks to work out but the beer was solid and I'll likely give them a 2nd shot before deciding they aren't worth the time.", "date": "2011-11-03 16:03:23", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 533, "average_stars": 3.69, "yelping_since": "2010-01-28 20:52:54"}}

I only assumed that this corner fell into ranks with the rest of the vacant spaces that occupy this area of Center City that I've recently heard referred to as \"the donut hole.\" A sad, but fitting name for an area with great potential but little success. Well I'm happy to announce that this donut finally has a dipping companion, and its name is: Milkboy (get it? Coffee and donuts...I thought it was clever).\n\nI knew, only by word of mouth, the awesomeness of the other two Milkboy Coffee locations. A coffee shop and music venue: how could you go wrong with that combination? My friend and I decided to stop here late last week to finally give it a try. I was feeling particularly sluggish after a long day at work, and thought some coffee would be the perfect pick-me-up. You can see before you even go inside what incredible potential this place has. The main entrance is on Chestnut Street, but they've actually converted the 11th Street side of the building into two huge garage-door style entrances where patrons are able to enjoy indoor/outdoor seating. When we entered there was a huge staircase in front of us, I can only imagine leading to the space that will eventually become the music venue (can't wait!). The downstairs space is actually somewhat limited, due largely to the fact that most of the room is occupied by the bar. Oh yea, did I mention this place serves alcohol?!\n\nWe decided to snag a seat at the bar, seeing as to get to the coffee register you have to walk all the way to the end of the room. Not sure if this was the best decision logistically, but I'm not complaining. Anyway, once we took our seat my attention quickly turned from that much-needed boost of caffeine to the cool intoxication of a beer. Their drink menu, while limited in size, had a nice selection of both draught and canned beers. Also, if you're looking to get loaded, they offer a Straub beer and shot of JD for a measly $6. Both my friend and I opted for a Wild Onion's Pumpkin Ale. I'd never heard of this craft brewery before, but it was arguably one of the best pumpkin beers I've tried. Wonderfully spiced and a great reminder that Fall's quickly approaching.\n\nI also decided to sample something from their (limited) food menu. There were a lot of burrito options, which seemed random, however, seeing as their kitchen only recently opened I'm sure over time their menu will expand along with their exposure. I decided to try the \"Pickled Veggie Tempura\" on the recommendation of our bartender. Lightly battered, house-pickled veggies served with buttermilk dipping sauce. Delicious. Check em out.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my first visit to Milkboy. I'm glad to see that all the time and red tape that was encountered while working to secure and convert this space has finally paid off. I'm looking forward to catching a show here sometime soon, not to mention grabbing a cup of their coffee...that is, if I can keep away from the bar.", "date": "2011-08-31 15:54:19", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 12, "average_stars": 4.15, "yelping_since": "2011-05-11 21:21:28"}}

I remember hearing from other friends that their Ardmore location had a TON of awesome vegan food on their menu and good coffee to boot.  I checked their menu for their Ardmore location and got really excited at the prospect of having a warm vegan breakfast (tofu scrambles and vegan scrapple, hell yes!) available to me on my way in to work.  With that being said, I spared no time in checking out the center city location for lunch.  \n\nWhen I got there, I was greeted by a waitress/barista and I asked if I can place a take out order, she handed me the menu and upon looking at it, was immediately disappointed in the vegan options, there are barely any!  No tofu, no tempeh bacon, no scrapple, no vegan cheese (daiya), just seitan and roasted veggies.  Not even any vegan baked goods!  Maybe it's just because they just opened and are just trying to figure out the kitchen before expanding their menu?  I don't know, but I ordered their seitan cheesesteak anyway (sans cheese, SO lame).  After waiting for almost 30 minutes (no exaggeration, literally 30 minutes!), I finally got my order and proceeded back to my office to dig into lunch.  I opened the container and seriously couldn't believe I just paid $9.72 for a 6 inch seitan cheesesteak.  Cut into half, I felt like I was eating a finger sandwich, not a cheesesteak.  That really sucked.  Coupled with the long wait time, the confusing ordering (I had to order my coffee and food separately), the fact that I heard the owner or manager yell at one of the employees, it was just NOT a good experience.  \n\nVegans, do yourself a favor and skip this place.  $10 for a kid-sized sandwich??  Ugh, I feel like I just got played.  And who knows if there is any cross-contamination going on the cooking surfaces.  Go to Blackbird, and get yourself a real sandwich that's double the size AND cheaper.  If you're looking for a beer to go with your food, there are PLENTY of gastropubs in center city that cater to vegans and your omnivorous friends - Monk's, Knodding Head, Khyber Pass Pub, just to name a few.\n\nNote: I have Milkboy two stars just because in theory, this place would be great.

I really enjoy their imaginative cocktail menu and they always have some great beers on tap with an awesome bartender to boot. You can't go wrong with their coffee on a hungover Saturday morning either.

The taste (aside from the chicken) was just OK - nothing really there to bring the whole thing together.

Why else would it take so long to bring it to me? My other theory is that they wrote up the description before ever having made this, and mine was the first one, and it took a few practice runs before they got one that met the minimal standards to serve on a plate.\n\nEither way, I'm disappointed that I spent so much of my limited city-exploring time waiting for someone to overcook a bland meal.

My wife and I came by around 10am on a recent Sunday and it wasn't open yet.  I was a little disappointed, considering it's a bar that features coffee, so my first critique would be that they shouldn't wait until 11am to open.  The good news is that it's in a great location so there was plenty to do for the hour we had to wait.\n\nOnce there we were very impressed with the friendly staff, including the talkative bartender.  But it's the food that keeps me coming back.  They have a very good Breakfast Burrito here; in my opinion it is the best in the city.  My wife prefers the one at Cafe Lift and it's hard to argue with that.  But Milkboy has chopped seitan as a topping you can add and this takes it over the top for me.  Scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, jack cheese, potatoes (inside the burrito, not on the side like at Lift), scallions, and pinto beans round it out with a spicy green sauce for dipping.  I also love that this burrito is meant to be eaten with your hands!  They wrap it up in tinfoil and paper, and you can eat the burrito the way God intended, another plus over Lift's.\n\nMy wife ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Seitan Sandwich and she had a foodgasm.  I was so happy to see her smile like that.  She had been waiting a long time to find a sandwich to replace her favorite that they used to serve at the Belgian Cafe but removed from the menu, and she told me this one was absolutely it.  The seitan was crispy and smoky and amazing.  The bread was a french roll.  And it comes with a mushroom jus for dipping that really sells the sandwich.  Fantastic.  We both can't wait to go back and have it again.  Do yourself a favor and replace the American cheese with Gruyere - it changes the sandwich.  I hate American cheese and it seems like a cheap add-on to such a great meal, so substituting Gruyere was perfect.  Our waitress even complimented us on the choice and told us people should all be doing it.\n\n The cocktails are OK.  They could use some slight improvement before Milkboy gets a 5 out of 5.

I work around the corner and first would stop in for after work drinks to take the edge off the long day, Kevin the bartender is always accommodating and incredibly funny. I drink Guinness and Jameson and a shot is $5, you can't beat it.\n\nI then learned they do live music and food, I had the fried catfish BLT having lived in TN for many years I find it hard to find good catfish done right it seems so simple, but it really isn't. The sandwich was perfect the fish flaky and warm but not dry, so then I got the bacon bowl which is genius, it's what it sounds like a big bowl of bacon...why is this not on every menu everywhere?\n\nI then learned they do third shift or \"breakfast\" for those not in the industry. I stopped in before work today and got the breakfast burrito with steak and a cup of coffee. Potatoes scrambled eggs pepper jack cheese steak scallions and the same size as those jumbo burritos at chipotle or qudoba for a grand total of $11.88 again you can't beat it. If you're in or around center city give milk boy a try. \n\nLove this place keep it up guys.", "date": "2014-01-31 16:07:39", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 10, "average_stars": 4.1, "yelping_since": "2013-05-20 19:32:26"}}

Despite the fact that yelps says it opens at 7am it did not open til 9 a.m.\n\nWe placed our order immediately as we had a 10 o'clock  tour to go to.I know its a bar slash restaurant but the minute we sat down they started blaring obnoxious heavy metal music this is at 9 o'clock on a Saturday morning. I felt like I was dealing with a bunch of petulent obnoxious rebellious  teenagers.  Anyway we placed our food order immediately.  We ordered omelettes and an egg sandwich.\n\nAt 945 we still had not received our food.  I mean we were the only people in the restaurant does it really take 45 minutes to jiggle up some eggs.  Adding insult to injury when we complained to young woman who appeared to be in charge she said \" I'm sorry if the food isn't coming out fast enough for you guys\". There were three women working there and just the 4 of us. We put our order in immediately upon arrival.  There's just no excuse for eggs to take that long.\n\nWorse yet was the managers attitude.  Not only was she rude but she seemed  more preoccupied with her tatoos and heavy metal music then taking care of the customers in the restaurant.  I would suggest for next tatoo she get one of either Aunt Jemima or Mrs Butterworth that tattoo could serve as a daily reminder that any idiot can prepare breakfast for four in  less than 45 minutes.", "date": "2013-07-06 20:32:23", "useful": 7, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 26, "average_stars": 2.55, "yelping_since": "2011-09-29 04:05:13"}}

And honestly, I'm not terribly impressed.\n\nThe happy hour here is pretty solid. Drafts and mixed drinks are $2 off and the beer selection is good enough to make me happy. I found the bartenders to be awesome, they were really nice people. I also enjoy getting a beer koozie when you order a can. I also have a special place in my heart for any place that serves me a drink in a mason jar.\n\nDinner here was eh.  It was bar food that tried to be slightly fancier, but was still just bar food. Granted, this is a bar so there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that. I wouldn't suggest seeking out the food here. It's fine for convenience, or for before seeing a show upstairs. (Note: tell your server you're going to the upstairs show, we almost missed the beginning because it took so long to get our check).\n\nThe upstairs has nice acoustics, but the long, skinny set up makes it kind of difficult to be near the stage. I also found the cover to be a bit on the high side ($10 for the one I went to). \n\nAfter looking over the upcoming shows, I wish this location seemed as into the local music scene as their Ardmore counterpart. I feel like they have more concern for getting \"larger\" national names than supporting our own pretty awesome local music scene. The problem with this is, when a local act opens the show, they will not receive any money until the cost of bringing in the larger act is covered, which ends up screwing over those local acts the vast majority of the time. In contrast, their Ardmore location pays acts based on how many people they bring. So if you brought 20 people, you'd get paid a percentage of 20 people's covers, no matter where you stand in the line up.\n\nI'm also a little confused as to how they think 200 people can fit up there. I'm thinking at 100, I'd start getting quite claustrophobic.", "date": "2012-07-06 15:00:56", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 267, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-01-15 20:44:09"}}

I think I may have a new favorite small venue. \n\nThe spot is very intimate and essentially a big room with a stage at one end and a bar at the other. The room has more length than width, and the stage isn't too high of a platform. You can get up, close and personal with the bands. Not to mention there's no \"back stage.\" Fangirl/fanboy away as the band walks up to the stage to start their gig. By far, my favorite aspect was the sound quality. I'm no physicists, but the long room did wonders for acoustics. That's such a huge deal, since I can think of some popular venues in this city with atrocious sound quality. \n\nI can't speak to all ticket pricing, but the show I attended in May 2018 was extremely inexpensive. I bought my tickets in advance online and paid $28.60 for two tickets when all was said and done with fees. How sad that the fees accounted for 30% of the cost! Day of tickets would've been $15. I'm curious if there are still fees if you buy at the venue. \n\nThe venue was very laid back. They stamp your hand after scanning your ticket, you are free to move between the venue upstairs and the downstairs bar. The bar in the venue doesn't offer drafts and the beer selection isn't overly exciting. Downstairs I was able to grab a draft beer to bring back up. While their draft list isn't huge, I lucked out with one of my favorites: Half Acre Double Galactic Daisy Cutter.  If you arrive before 7pm, you can even take advantage of happy hour. \n\nChill scene, great sound and good vibes.", "date": "2018-05-24 18:06:36", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 1402, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-04-19 19:23:27"}}

After finishing a shift, a colleague and I were in the mood for a brew before passing out, at around 8am. Much to my complete aghastion (not a word apparently) this place was open and LIT. \n\nWe squeezed onto a high top near the open windows. I actually like being adjacent to the outdoors. Adjacent is the key word here. \n\nIt was actually difficult to track down the bartender it was so poppin'. I have zero patience so I creeped behind as she was placing orders and then squeezed into the corner to place an order. \n\nDespite the fact that by some miracle I wasn't hungry, my dining companion suggested nachos. Fuck, she knows my weakness. \n\nI caved and very adamantly specified \"no onions\" when I placed my order. 7:30am-drinks-companion ordered a blue moon. Milkboy had me at both \"pumpkin\" and \"stout\".\n\nDespite the fact that I love both pumpkin (ShOuT oUt To My BaSiCc BiTcHeSsSs) and stouts, this brew was disgusting. I had to force it down while pinching my nose. \n\nThe 'chos came pretty quickly. Just look at the photo to see how well they accomodated my \"no onions\" request. Unamused face. Because we were in a rush to get into bed, I didn't want to complain. My dining companion just tried to push off the onions as best as she could onto a napkin but it's difficult trying to filter them out and leave the seitan and tomatoes. I had to wade around the onions. Eating shouldn't require effort.\n\nWhen there was about 15% remaining in my stout glass, I ordered a bloody mary. Way too liquidy and horse radishy.

So their Philly location was a no brainer that I had been waiting years for as a result.\n\nI had my first chance to check it out during the Yelp Intern Event and I was instantly enamored. Downstairs still gave the same cafe feel that you'd become accustomed to from the other spots, while adding in a full bar with some choice drafts and an impressive food menu. the meatballs, wraps, chicken wings, and other choice bites we were offered were delicious, and have me ready to try it out for a food visit. And I especially can't wait to try boozy coffee drinks like the Picket Line that Sue suggested.\n\nUpstairs yielded an impressive stage, and a bar that has plenty of booze and the most impressive selection of canned beers that I've seen any bar offer. From basics like PBR and Rolling Rock, to craft brews like Six Point and Oskar Blues, to imports like Strongbow and Becks; if its a beer that comes in a can then there's a good chance that they'll have it.\n\nI finally went to a show when my friends Penrose (http://penrose.bandcamp.com/) and En Fuego (http://enfuego.bandcamp.com/) celebrated En Fuego's Album Release and I was definitely in awe. The sound was perfection, and the lights and smoke effects were flawless enough to the point that they were even able to be controlled from an IPAD (I think I finally have a reason to want one!). The shared bathroom situation was the only thing that was kind of awkward, but it was a manageable hassle.\n\nSince that point Milkboy has soldiered on with some eclectic show lineups.

I knew I would have a problem when I learned that counter culture was their bean of choice...although I WANT badly to like fair trade brands, there has NEVER been one that I find to my liking. Dark is the bean that pleases the galester. I HATED both blends that were on tap; a house that was medium, described as a mocha Java, and a varietal (that will change daily) of El Salvador. They made me an americano, no extra charge, and they KNOW coffee, because like a hawk I watched her deftly manipulate the ones and twos like a DJ, producing a crema that was smile worthy. They will boast a full kitchen where veg and vegan options will abound, and look out for beer on 6 taps and a show lineup scheduled as they evolve into a 2 floor nightspot. Happy hour begins at 5, and although the price point is high, their quality is Top notch. It IS the first day though, so as they grow and I revisit, we will see how the updates fare.
