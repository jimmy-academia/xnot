Speaking of getting things done, no one bothered me or gave me a second glance as I read D. H. Lawrence's the Rainbow (well, the introduction), and a communist newspaper. Both are good qualities in a cafe, at least by my book of books.\n\nSpeaking of which, the majority of the customers/visitors were indeed doing work--reading, such as myself, or using a computer, or engaged in some group activity. There were a couple couples that chilled outside, as the December Globally-Warmed Climate allowed for that to be comfortable. All in all, there are probably ten tables, including the two outside. But the place is a bit crowded, with tables each fitting around four people total, so I would not recommend large groups.\n\nThe food was fine. Check out the semi-strange selection of sandwiches and omelets. I tried the Brie Sandwich, which include Brie (not sure the kind), granny smith apples, on toasted raisin bread. It wasn't the most complex thing in the world but I've never heard anything like it so I gave it a shot. Great bargain--four bucks. There were also bigger sandwiches on hoagey-style rolls, and salads, and soups. Also, sandwiches come with free salad or chips. I went with the salad. A lot of cucumbers but I hear those things are good for you, so I'm over my marked distaste for them.\n\nThe barista, or counter help, was a nice woman who seemed helpful and friendly to most customers. I'd definitely go back, and in fact, let's switch that tense over--I will definitely go back. It helps that the place is located in one of the hippest neighborhoods in Philadelphia--Northern Liberties--and it helps that there's a lot of cool galleries/bars nearby, Market Street a five minute walk southwards, and highways on the other side, tearing the neighborhood apart.

Perhaps it is prepared in the basement? \n\nThis tangent doesn't much matter, as there didn't seem to be much cooking going on anyway.

Even my good lady was unable to pretend that this plate, and indeed place, was anything other than bollux.

Most of the places I have been visiting have been nothing short of 5 stars and this tiny cafe is on that list! You may ask why so many stars for a little coffee shop? Let me paint a picture in your mind...\n\nYou are tried and thirsty from the heat. You turn down 3rd street to steer clear of the crowds on Market and come across a little shaded cafe. You order an iced coffee and iced green tea with subtle hints of mint and lemon. Suddenly, you feel refreshed! \n\nIf the beverages of this cafe aren't enough, you can look to their tables outside on the sidewalk or the comfiness of the chairs toward the back, where you can sit and chat and not be bothered.\n\nI know what you're thinking. So what? You can get that anywhere. Well here's where the five stars come in. \n\nSince that iced tea was so damn good and refreshing, we decided to order another one only large this time. Instead our server informed us that there were free refills and that he could just refill each of our cups with iced tea. I don't know about you, but this is kind of a rare thing to have happen at an independent coffee house. I mean even Starbuck's (a large corporation that has mediocre drinks at best) charges you for refills (I know unless you have a SBUX card, but still!) I was just pleasantly surprised of how nice our barista was and how he didn't charge us for the refills.

The waitress/hostess behind the counter who took our order probably could've perked up a little bit, as she seemed a bit moody/distracted/inattentive.  It's fine, as you only have to order and then you can go find a seat and wait for your food to be called.\n\nThey have an assortment of chai tea lattes, which are super delicious, a bit sweet, and surprisingly a little filling.  When our food came out, we were shocked at how much they give you - a full plate of 'shakshuka' - two poached eggs covered in tomatoes, onions, garlic, and a tomato-based warm sauce.  The two sesame buns it comes with are super flaky and melt in your mouth delicious, along with this creamy butter with olive oil to dip it in.  It was by far one of the tastiest brunches I've had, as the flavors and aromas work so well together.  It does pack a punch, not in a spicy way, but in a flavorful way.  It can be a bit messy and definitely eat it quick, because as soon as it starts to get lukewarm, it doesn't taste as good, as the texture of the dish also changes.\n\nOverall, a fantastic spot and I'll definitely be back to have more!", "date": "2017-06-09 19:31:04", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 389, "average_stars": 3.73, "yelping_since": "2010-09-17 17:24:01"}}

So I had to get a refund and leave because I had to go to work and couldn't wait another 20. The second time someone else took my order from the counter so I had to wait another 20 minutes to get his order instead. And today I waited for almost a half hour and then finally approached the counter and asked how much longer it would be. My food had apparently been sitting under the register getting cold and no one called it out? They were apologetic but again, very frustrating because I was sitting there wasting time.\n\nI think the food is great here and the workers are polite which is why I have continued to come back. However I think there's some communication issues between the food runners and the other staff, at least it seems to always happen with my orders. It seems like these things could be easily fixed, perhaps by adding a person's name to the order?

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I saw that they had good reviews, so I was hopeful.\n\nWe were surprised at how busy they were, considering the weather and the holiday weekend, but the staff is clearly used to a rush of people, because they handled the crowd effortlessly. Even though it was very busy, we didn't feel cramped at our table, or rushed to finish our meal.\n\nThey have a wide array of freshly baked goods, breakfast options, fruit cups, salads, and sandwiches. They also offer standard coffee options. I was planning on getting a latte until I saw the varieties of chai flavors that they offer, and went with a dulce de leche chai latte w/ soymilk. They have non-dairy milk options (almond or soy, from what I recall) for a small surcharge. It was very delicious and not overly sweet. My friend ordered the spice chai latte with almond milk, and said that it was also very good. \n\nFor breakfast, two of us chose the pesto omelette, which had pesto mixed into the eggs, and was filled with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and olives. It came with a warm roll and a side salad. The bread came with a dipping sauce with oil & sesame seeds, but I am not sure what it was called, or what else was in it. The omelette was fresh and very tasty. The third person in our party ordered the egg & cheese on a croissant, and had them add spinach to it. She said that it was very tasty & satisfying.\n\nI would definitely consider stopping by here again sometime.

I ordered a vegan wrap too and it came up while other customers were still being waited on, and I was being asked to pay while someone else was still being rung up... hey one at a time!\n\nThe tea was good, and the lemon and other herbs in there which seemed odd at first were actually a nice touch. The vegan wrap was more like a panini, and just barely warm, and cold in the middle.

It was training day for a new staff member, so there was a lot of uncomfortable banter between the owner (?) and the new trainee.
