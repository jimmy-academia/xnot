Standard horseradish sauce with two tiny pieces of lemon per platter. 4/10\n\nSeafood etouffee - pretty good (can't go wrong with tomato and cream) but salty. We added the fried crawfish, and the fried pieces were tiny and mostly batter. 6/10\n\nNew Orleans medley - sausage was kind of dry, seafood gumbo was really yummy as was the jambalaya, and the beans and rice had nice chunks of meat in it. Overall pretty good save for the sausage, but I again feel that there are better places to go for these dishes. 7/10\n\nSoup of the day - on 1/16/2022 it was corn and crab chowder.
