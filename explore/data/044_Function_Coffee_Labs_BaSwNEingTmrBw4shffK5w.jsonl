I live in a city that attracts coffee enthusiasts from across the country, and I'd trade all of Portland's award-winning specialty roasters and retailers for easier access to a caf\u00e9 like this.\n \nTake 60 seconds to scan the menu overhead and there will be no need to read between the lines: Function Coffee Labs is out to save you from so much as a sip from a subpar cup. This is very, very good coffee. Meticulously sourced, small-batch, artisanal; you could rattle off all the makings of a third wave coffee shop too. But it's not just the espresso (or the coffee shot, or the cortado, or the cappuccino -- oh my god, the cappuccino) that makes me wish FCL were a fixture on my own walk to work.\n \n-Service: Chances are, the owner will be the one behind the bar. Here's what I liked about Ross: he's able to read people. If Instagram is your thing, you can count on a latte that looks too good to drink. If you want to talk about the latest signature drink and grams and fluid ounces and what he's tweaked to dial it in that day, he will happily oblige. It doesn't matter whether you've ordered the same drink for the past decade or if 90% of your counter space is devoted to home brewing gadgets and accessories. There's nobody more down-to-earth, knowledgeable, or contagiously enthusiastic about temperature, technique, purveyors, and flavors. But if you just want your large iced coffee to go, ideally sooner rather than later (since you're running a few minutes behind), he'll hop to it. And in either case, he's bound to remember your name the next time you come in.\n \n-Ambiance: 10/10. Perfect playlists. The happy hum of caffeinated (and soon-to-be caffeinated) people. Just the right amount of miscellaneous background noise. No shortage of green growing things. A variety of tables for slow-sipping, talking, reading, or working. This is the type of place where you can meet someone for a blind date, catch up with a friend, get good work done on your laptop, and/or easily befriend someone sitting a table away.\n \n-Aesthetic (and other bonuses): Ross's fianc\u00e9 and co-owner, Meg, is behind much of FCL's aesthetic appeal. The brightly lit, smartly branded shop has a clear color palette, with broad navy strokes and splashes of white. Copper elements abound, as do pretty pops of turquoise. A chalkboard sign out front speaks to Ross and Meg's combined intelligence and wit; the creative commentary is often as social media worthy as any pourover action shot. The real draw, however, may be the bakery case, which is loaded with the homey and locally sourced, each more irresistible than the next. If none of the day's sweet treats sway you, snack options range from Stroopwafels and bean-to-bar chocolates to RX bars and overnight oats. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on one of the half dozen breakfast sandwiches the caf\u00e9 puts out each morning, don't tell me. You'll break my heart.\n \nAll this to say, if you're lucky enough to have Function Coffee Labs at your fingertips: Go hungry. Go thirsty.
