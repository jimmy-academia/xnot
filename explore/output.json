Definitely very fresh, and you can taste it. The chargrilled was definitely different from the raw, but in a good way. Those were smothered in butter, garlic, and cheese (definitely a recipe for clogged arteries but so worth it). The poopa I got was a seafood gumbo in a bread bowl.

This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal. I'll start off by saying it is slightly pricey but you honestly get what you pay for! I paid around a total of $117 (not including the tip) for this so I'm yeah lol anyways! Located in the heart area of New Orleans. \\nThe gumbo 5/5: The flavor is just so savory and delicious. The chicken and sausage is super tender and mind you, I am not a fan of okra but this one in particular is super soft and BARELY noticeable. The flavor is delicious and I never leave a single drop when I order! Definitely a must! \\nThe fried boudin 5/5: This is honestly a New Orleans staple but these are the best dang boudin balls I've ever had. The texture of the ball is so crispy but the middle is super soft. The meat and the rice are perfectly seasoned it's hard to find anything to compare it with and the Dijon mustard dip I believe they give with it adds a nice sour flavor to it.\\nThe mac and cheese casserole 5/5: I believe it has onions in it? And I am honestly not a fan of onions but I barely even noticed it was in there! And I have some pretty strong taste buds. The macaroni is nice and soft while the top is nice and crispy and hits you with a sharp cheddar flavor. It's enough to honestly get as an entree! \\nLastly we have the smoked porterhouse 2lb pork 5/5: I didn't eat this myself although I think I could considering how delicious it was. The pork has a nice smokey flavor to it and the sauce that comes on top of it has a smokey almost faint wine taste to it? But it isn't anything crazy that takes away the taste of the pork. It really makes the pork even juicer. The pork itself reminded me of a Christmas ham. Except it was super tender and not dry at all. It felt lean honestly. I'm a person who tends to fear too much pork since it usually gives me chest pain if I eat too greasy but this was on point. I didn't even feel full afterwards because I was still down to get some beignets! \\nAnyways, if you're visiting New Orleans I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, you will not regret it!\", 'date': '2021-11-08 22:13:53'}\n[R26] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': '9unutXmPv4y1PK8IKwuCTQ', 'user_id': 'Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ', 'business_id': '6a4gLLFSgr-Q6CZXDLzBGQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 4, 'text': \"Great food in a relaxed, modern location.

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pay as much attention to our companions\\' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen\\'s\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn\\'t think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal.

This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal. I'll start off by saying it is slightly pricey but you honestly get what you pay for! I paid around a total of $117 (not including the tip) for this so I'm yeah lol anyways! Located in the heart area of New Orleans. \\nThe gumbo 5/5: The flavor is just so savory and delicious. The chicken and sausage is super tender and mind you, I am not a fan of okra but this one in particular is super soft and BARELY noticeable. The flavor is delicious and I never leave a single drop when I order! Definitely a must! \\nThe fried boudin 5/5: This is honestly a New Orleans staple but these are the best dang boudin balls I've ever had. The texture of the ball is so crispy but the middle is super soft. The meat and the rice are perfectly seasoned it's hard to find anything to compare it with and the Dijon mustard dip I believe they give with it adds a nice sour flavor to it.\\nThe mac and cheese casserole 5/5: I believe it has onions in it? And I am honestly not a fan of onions but I barely even noticed it was in there! And I have some pretty strong taste buds. The macaroni is nice and soft while the top is nice and crispy and hits you with a sharp cheddar flavor. It's enough to honestly get as an entree! \\nLastly we have the smoked porterhouse 2lb pork 5/5: I didn't eat this myself although I think I could considering how delicious it was. The pork has a nice smokey flavor to it and the sauce that comes on top of it has a smokey almost faint wine taste to it? But it isn't anything crazy that takes away the taste of the pork. It really makes the pork even juicer. The pork itself reminded me of a Christmas ham. Except it was super tender and not dry at all. It felt lean honestly. I'm a person who tends to fear too much pork since it usually gives me chest pain if I eat too greasy but this was on point. I didn't even feel full afterwards because I was still down to get some beignets! \\nAnyways, if you're visiting New Orleans I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, you will not regret it!\", 'date': '2021-11-08 22:13:53'}\n[R26] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': '9unutXmPv4y1PK8IKwuCTQ', 'user_id': 'Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ', 'business_id': '6a4gLLFSgr-Q6CZXDLzBGQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 4, 'text': \"Great food in a relaxed, modern location.

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pay as much attention to our companions\\' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen\\'s\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn\\'t think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal.

This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal. I'll start off by saying it is slightly pricey but you honestly get what you pay for! I paid around a total of $117 (not including the tip) for this so I'm yeah lol anyways! Located in the heart area of New Orleans. \\nThe gumbo 5/5: The flavor is just so savory and delicious. The chicken and sausage is super tender and mind you, I am not a fan of okra but this one in particular is super soft and BARELY noticeable. The flavor is delicious and I never leave a single drop when I order! Definitely a must! \\nThe fried boudin 5/5: This is honestly a New Orleans staple but these are the best dang boudin balls I've ever had. The texture of the ball is so crispy but the middle is super soft. The meat and the rice are perfectly seasoned it's hard to find anything to compare it with and the Dijon mustard dip I believe they give with it adds a nice sour flavor to it.\\nThe mac and cheese casserole 5/5: I believe it has onions in it? And I am honestly not a fan of onions but I barely even noticed it was in there! And I have some pretty strong taste buds. The macaroni is nice and soft while the top is nice and crispy and hits you with a sharp cheddar flavor. It's enough to honestly get as an entree! \\nLastly we have the smoked porterhouse 2lb pork 5/5: I didn't eat this myself although I think I could considering how delicious it was. The pork has a nice smokey flavor to it and the sauce that comes on top of it has a smokey almost faint wine taste to it? But it isn't anything crazy that takes away the taste of the pork. It really makes the pork even juicer. The pork itself reminded me of a Christmas ham. Except it was super tender and not dry at all. It felt lean honestly. I'm a person who tends to fear too much pork since it usually gives me chest pain if I eat too greasy but this was on point. I didn't even feel full afterwards because I was still down to get some beignets! \\nAnyways, if you're visiting New Orleans I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, you will not regret it!\", 'date': '2021-11-08 22:13:53'}\n[R26] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': '9unutXmPv4y1PK8IKwuCTQ', 'user_id': 'Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ', 'business_id': '6a4gLLFSgr-Q6CZXDLzBGQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 4, 'text': \"Great food in a relaxed, modern location.

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pay as much attention to our companions\\' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen\\'s\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn\\'t think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal.

This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal. I'll start off by saying it is slightly pricey but you honestly get what you pay for! I paid around a total of $117 (not including the tip) for this so I'm yeah lol anyways! Located in the heart area of New Orleans. \\nThe gumbo 5/5: The flavor is just so savory and delicious. The chicken and sausage is super tender and mind you, I am not a fan of okra but this one in particular is super soft and BARELY noticeable. The flavor is delicious and I never leave a single drop when I order! Definitely a must! \\nThe fried boudin 5/5: This is honestly a New Orleans staple but these are the best dang boudin balls I've ever had. The texture of the ball is so crispy but the middle is super soft. The meat and the rice are perfectly seasoned it's hard to find anything to compare it with and the Dijon mustard dip I believe they give with it adds a nice sour flavor to it.\\nThe mac and cheese casserole 5/5: I believe it has onions in it? And I am honestly not a fan of onions but I barely even noticed it was in there! And I have some pretty strong taste buds. The macaroni is nice and soft while the top is nice and crispy and hits you with a sharp cheddar flavor. It's enough to honestly get as an entree! \\nLastly we have the smoked porterhouse 2lb pork 5/5: I didn't eat this myself although I think I could considering how delicious it was. The pork has a nice smokey flavor to it and the sauce that comes on top of it has a smokey almost faint wine taste to it? But it isn't anything crazy that takes away the taste of the pork. It really makes the pork even juicer. The pork itself reminded me of a Christmas ham. Except it was super tender and not dry at all. It felt lean honestly. I'm a person who tends to fear too much pork since it usually gives me chest pain if I eat too greasy but this was on point. I didn't even feel full afterwards because I was still down to get some beignets! \\nAnyways, if you're visiting New Orleans I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, you will not regret it!\", 'date': '2021-11-08 22:13:53'}\n[R26] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': '9unutXmPv4y1PK8IKwuCTQ', 'user_id': 'Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ', 'business_id': '6a4gLLFSgr-Q6CZXDLzBGQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 4, 'text': \"Great food in a relaxed, modern location.

For drinks: the Ramblin Rose and the Elevation.\\n\\nThe gumbo was pleasant and well-balanced. It had good flavor and spice without overdoing it. Some of the rice felt a little undercooked, but I'm not sure if that's intentional. There was also a small bone in the gumbo (oops). \\n\\nThe fried gator was a tasty dish as well.

I want to note that some pieces were a little less tender than others, but full disclosure, I'm not sure if that is the nature of gator meat.\\n\\nThe wood-fired oysters were solid.

Highly regarded Cajun cuisine that works with local farms for a large amount of their ingredients. Menu, though not extensive, looked great before our arrival so was looking very forward to our meal. I would consider it on the pricy side, though maybe not for New Orleans. Very personable service throughout our time here. Once seated we ordered drinks and perused the menu. A bowl of delicious rolls with butter arrived shortly. Having just gotten off a plane and not being all that hungry, along with being budget conscious, we chose to order light. Wife ordered the bacon and pork pie and the cucumbers and herbs in vinegar salad. My choices were the chicken & andouille sausage gumbo along with fried alligator with chili garlic mayo. The pork pie was a bit light on flavor-lacking any discernible seasoning or bacon flavor. More bacon would add a lot. The crust was well made and it was cooked perfectly. Cucumber salad had a large amount, IMO, of red chili flakes not listed on the menu. Avoiding them was difficult but she powered through it, pronouncing it \"fine\". My gator was delicious, tasting very fresh and lightly breaded. But for me, as I was expecting, the chili mayo was too much for my palate. Very small bits of sauce added to the flavor but it was easy to add too much. The gumbo was the star of the show for me. Deep, rich flavor profile along with tender veggies and sausage that was flavorful without being too hot. I should really have ordered more of this.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pay as much attention to our companions\\' meals as I should have but I did try a bite of the wood fired gulf fish served \"fishermen\\'s\" style that on our visit was redfish. Requested grilled, it had a great seasoning and was very reminiscent, IMO, of a fresh trout, though the person who ordered it compared it to halibut. I didn\\'t think so.  Desserts were a German Chocolate Pie and an Apple Cider donut. The donut was pronounced flavorful by our fellow diners but I never tried it as I was fully involved in our pie. I will say it was not really like a pie IMO as the texture was very firm, not soft and moist like a traditional pie. It resembled to me more of a pecan pie with chocolate and coconut or a 7-layer bar for those who know what those are. Very very good. A really enjoyable meal.

He seemed to be annoyed by our presence and disengaged with providing the service that had be raved about. My husband and I are still unsure what we could've done to warrant a change in demeanor. While we barely got the occasional check in, 2 nearby tables were doted on. My husband never got his napkin (that he asked for back) and we were never given the opportunity to ask for another drink. By the time we finished dinner, we were eager to leave. Given it was our anniversary and that my husband notified the restaurant upon booking, we were given ice cream (sweet policy of the restaurant) that was pretty much dropped at our table.

The gumbo was delicious and I had plenty of gumbo on this trip. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I decided on the Gulf shrimp with greens while he had the pecan encrusted fish (Black drum). The shrimp were big and plump. The fish was delightful. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the bread pudding souffle which is their specialty. This needs to be ordered in advance because it takes 20 minutes to prepare. I really wanted the Bananas Foster but it's a two-person dessert and my bf isn't a sweets person. The souffle was poufy and they poured a liquor laced cream sauce into it which gave it a boozy flavor. It was light and boozy, much like the ambiance in New Orleans.

You won't regret it.\", 'date': '2021-11-08 16:47:51'}\n[R13] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'ogcNwUh3_uH9YfpuSA4zTw', 'user_id': 'wxpZQhwke9-99xaZQBYDcA', 'business_id': '_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"One of the must do places in NOLA.

Kept hoping it would improve but bafflingly it got even worse. He lectured us like misbehaving children when we asked about ala carte options rather than the 3-course Prix-fix meal.  \\n\\nDid you ever think that maybe 1 or 2 of our 6 diners woke up with digestive issues that were not present when we made the reservations a month ago? We didnt want to bum anyone out or cancel, so we just kept it to ourselves and decided to try to go a little smaller. A little less snide attitude and a little more understanding from would have been much appreciated. Maybe Trust that there was a reason we somehow wanted less, not more.  Please in the future consider that there might be a legit reason a customer might want a smaller meal. \\n\\nUnfortunately this was just a mockable moment for  Dewayne.  Everyone must overindulge and be decadent and not watch calories and live-a-little and other super \"funny\"  lines of persuasion we were unnecessarily and unfortunately subjected to.  I would have loved to spend the  morning over-eating and over-drinking, but I couldn\\'t and the juvenile lame unfunny comments made it even worse. \\n\\nIn addition to the poor main service, the assistants were kind of off too. They put the drinks in front of the wrong people, then the meals in front of the wrong people, then the desserts in front of the wrong people. At some point I thought we were being punked with some kind of pathetic practical joke. It\\'s not like we switched seats or anything.  No one emptied our gumbos into our bowls, so it just sat there in its tin cup. And  the whole process seemed to take too long. \\n\\nNow, of course, all of these secondary mistakes would easily have been overlooked if we were having fun, but we seemed to be getting punishing  for some reason or bad day, and we were really just ready to be gone.  Instead we had the service \"team\" repeatedly disappear and leave dirty dishes on the table for twenty minutes at a time.  And Then the band came. They were good, but their timing.... not so much.  We already had one foot out the door.\\n\\nThe food itself was, however, indisputably wonderful and other servers we observed seemed much more smiley, friendly and -I hope- better.  I am therefore willing to cut some slack for a bad outing and hope DeWayne pays forward the same courtesy the next time someone deigns to ask for a smaller meal or an adjustment to the menu. Or even if he\\'s just grumpy.

First, nothing makes me happier as a Yelp elite reviewer than when a manager or owner comes over and greets the tables. On this particular night my party was greeted by the owner of the restaurant not once but twice as she made her way around to all of the tables in the dining room. This is a true showing of Class and Customer Service. In the midst of everything that she is responsible for as an owner she took the time to come by two times in the few hours that we were there to eat our meal that is a class act. Our waitress her name was Keisha and she was fantastic, very lovely and knowledgeable of the menu and she took really good care of us. The food was fantastic and the desserts were to die for. The matrody greeted us as if we were family returning home from a vacation which was also nice. But the evening began when we arrived and the valet outside was beyond nice and accommodating for my party. He was all smiles and I wish I knew his name because he definitely deserves recognition for having been at this location for years, I remember seeing him the last time I was in town.

The souffle dessert is great and unique with a touch of liquor. The shortcake strawberry sauce is a bit too sweet for me.\\n\\nThe service does not match the high qualify food. It\\'s the first time I got annoyed by service. A good service should be invisible when not needed and catering when needed, not pressuring. Either the waiters were not well trained or they didn\\'t really care. At first, we couldn\\'t decide what to drink, and our waiter just stood there while we were reading the drink menu. I felt quite pressured like a student being supervised by a teacher to order a drink on the spot. I should probably tell him that I needed a minute. But I was just settling down and wasn\\'t familiar with the place to ask him to leave. And then I asked for recommendations, either the waiter really likes expensive drinks or he thinks the more expensive drink tastes better, he recommended the two most pricey drink on the menu, which didn\\'t really fit my tastebud. Then comes the entree, without telling us there was an extra charge (or maybe he did? But we definitely didn\\'t hear it), he suggested us to add crab meat in our dish, and we thought it was just part of the dish, so we agreed. Turns out there was an extra $20 for the crab. We might still order it if he told us the price, but we felt uncomfortable without being informed and then saw it on the bill. Another waiter didn\\'t do our utensils properly, making me wonder if they were trained properly. They also forgot to serve our side dish, and the waiter was busy serving several tables, so it was not easy to gesture him. Last, the check. They brought the POS machine to the table and our waiter put 25% tips and asked if it is okay. It would be REALLY awkward if a customer says \"no, I\\'d tip less. \" So I bet most customers would just say \"ok\" and let go with it. I usually only tip 25% if the service is really impressive, but for them, if I have a choice, I\\'d tip much less. Overall, the service at this place feels pressuring and not professional. \\n\\nSo good food, but no matching and unpleasant service.

Everything was cooked to perfection. The Crispy NOLA Barbeque Bayou Frog Leg on Garlic Focaccia was a perfect starter to whet my appetite. The Caf\u00e9 Pierre Lacquered Texas Quail Stuffed with Boudin was probably the best Quail I have ever had in my life.

When we were sat at the table, our waiter (Dwayne) immediately greets us, removing our napkins from our plates to return to my lap but never to my husbands. We ordered some apps and our meal and a pour of Pappy (we were impressed at the availability and range of Pappy). Upon receiving our drinks, something seemed to change with our server, Dwayne. He seemed to be annoyed by our presence and disengaged with providing the service that had be raved about. My husband and I are still unsure what we could've done to warrant a change in demeanor. While we barely got the occasional check in, 2 nearby tables were doted on. My husband never got his napkin (that he asked for back) and we were never given the opportunity to ask for another drink. By the time we finished dinner, we were eager to leave. Given it was our anniversary and that my husband notified the restaurant upon booking, we were given ice cream (sweet policy of the restaurant) that was pretty much dropped at our table. At this point, my husband and I felt that we were stuck waiting to leave and most certainly weren't going to upset Dwayne by not having the ice cream.

We were quickly whisked upstairs to the garden room. Our servers Duwayne and Jerryd were outstanding. \\n\\nWe started with a few cocktails: Sazarac and Fuzzy Buffalo. I tried the classic Sazarac which is a typical New Orleans cocktail. It wasn't my jam so I traded my bf for his Fuzzy Buffalo. For round two, I opted for the Honey Rush, which was perfect. \\n\\nWe started with the 1-1-1 soup trio: turtle soup, gumbo, and soup du jour (potato leek). The soups are amazing and you would have a hard time choosing just one. I didn't think I'd like the turtle soup but it was delicious and reminded me of a soupy chili but in a good way. The potato soup was outstanding with its depth of flavor. The gumbo was delicious and I had plenty of gumbo on this trip. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I decided on the Gulf shrimp with greens while he had the pecan encrusted fish (Black drum). The shrimp were big and plump. The fish was delightful. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the bread pudding souffle which is their specialty. This needs to be ordered in advance because it takes 20 minutes to prepare. I really wanted the Bananas Foster but it's a two-person dessert and my bf isn't a sweets person. The souffle was poufy and they poured a liquor laced cream sauce into it which gave it a boozy flavor. It was light and boozy, much like the ambiance in New Orleans.

He lectured us like misbehaving children when we asked about ala carte options rather than the 3-course Prix-fix meal.  \\n\\nDid you ever think that maybe 1 or 2 of our 6 diners woke up with digestive issues that were not present when we made the reservations a month ago? We didnt want to bum anyone out or cancel, so we just kept it to ourselves and decided to try to go a little smaller. A little less snide attitude and a little more understanding from would have been much appreciated. Maybe Trust that there was a reason we somehow wanted less, not more.  Please in the future consider that there might be a legit reason a customer might want a smaller meal. \\n\\nUnfortunately this was just a mockable moment for  Dewayne.  Everyone must overindulge and be decadent and not watch calories and live-a-little and other super \"funny\"  lines of persuasion we were unnecessarily and unfortunately subjected to.  I would have loved to spend the  morning over-eating and over-drinking, but I couldn\\'t and the juvenile lame unfunny comments made it even worse. \\n\\nIn addition to the poor main service, the assistants were kind of off too. They put the drinks in front of the wrong people, then the meals in front of the wrong people, then the desserts in front of the wrong people. At some point I thought we were being punked with some kind of pathetic practical joke. It\\'s not like we switched seats or anything.  No one emptied our gumbos into our bowls, so it just sat there in its tin cup. And  the whole process seemed to take too long. \\n\\nNow, of course, all of these secondary mistakes would easily have been overlooked if we were having fun, but we seemed to be getting punishing  for some reason or bad day, and we were really just ready to be gone.  Instead we had the service \"team\" repeatedly disappear and leave dirty dishes on the table for twenty minutes at a time.  And Then the band came. They were good, but their timing.... not so much.  We already had one foot out the door.\\n\\nThe food itself was, however, indisputably wonderful and other servers we observed seemed much more smiley, friendly and -I hope- better.

The best table service of any restaurant in North America, hands down.\\n\\nWhen you come to a top-drawer restaurant, it\\'s about the total experience. Commander\\'s Palace, downstairs, is more for the locals. It\\'s old-school elegant. Paneled walls. People who have been dining there for a long time. For the tourists, we almost always get the top floor, or the patio, in better weather. Both are lovely spaces.\\n\\nThe food is always exceptional. Even menu items that are a bit more \"classic,\" like the Pecan Crusted Fish, are prepared with perfection. The  Shrimp & Tasso Henican was a delicious start. Turtle Soup is a house standard, with a bit of sherry drizzled in liberally, at service. Newer dishes, like Maggie\\'s Autumn Mushroom Strudel, are experiential cuisine.\\n\\nDessert was excellent.  We shared a bread pudding souffl\u00e9.  DO order in advance, at the start of the meal. Amazingly light, totally delicious.\\n\\nCocktails are a specialty here. For one of the top restaurants in New Orleans, their very pedestrian bourbon list, with the rise of boutique limited-run brands like Wilderness Trail, or Kentucky Owl,  may be their only Achilles heel.\\n\\nYour bread is like a cloud. Your water glass will always be full.  \\n\\nService? I\\'ve paid more, at other New Orleans top-shelf dining, for a lot less. It\\'s not just that the staff here is highly professional. They\\'re kind. They\\'re gracious. They have a sense of humor. You can train someone to do a job. To treat what is, at 99% of restaurants, a \"gig\" that ranges from slinging hash, to sucking up for cash, there is nothing slapdash about Commander\\'s Palace service. \\n\\nAnother notable is that the front desk always is not only professional, but CALM. Pleasant. They set a wonderful tone for the evening.

It\\'s the first time I got annoyed by service. A good service should be invisible when not needed and catering when needed, not pressuring. Either the waiters were not well trained or they didn\\'t really care. At first, we couldn\\'t decide what to drink, and our waiter just stood there while we were reading the drink menu. I felt quite pressured like a student being supervised by a teacher to order a drink on the spot. I should probably tell him that I needed a minute. But I was just settling down and wasn\\'t familiar with the place to ask him to leave. And then I asked for recommendations, either the waiter really likes expensive drinks or he thinks the more expensive drink tastes better, he recommended the two most pricey drink on the menu, which didn\\'t really fit my tastebud. Then comes the entree, without telling us there was an extra charge (or maybe he did? But we definitely didn\\'t hear it), he suggested us to add crab meat in our dish, and we thought it was just part of the dish, so we agreed. Turns out there was an extra $20 for the crab. We might still order it if he told us the price, but we felt uncomfortable without being informed and then saw it on the bill. Another waiter didn\\'t do our utensils properly, making me wonder if they were trained properly. They also forgot to serve our side dish, and the waiter was busy serving several tables, so it was not easy to gesture him. Last, the check. They brought the POS machine to the table and our waiter put 25% tips and asked if it is okay. It would be REALLY awkward if a customer says \"no, I\\'d tip less. \" So I bet most customers would just say \"ok\" and let go with it. I usually only tip 25% if the service is really impressive, but for them, if I have a choice, I\\'d tip much less.

They have valet service, ambient lighting, and a dress code (which I'm ambivalent about; however, I do love a reason to get dressed up, especially after not having many opportunities to do so in lockdown.)

Everything was cooked to perfection. The Crispy NOLA Barbeque Bayou Frog Leg on Garlic Focaccia was a perfect starter to whet my appetite. The Caf\u00e9 Pierre Lacquered Texas Quail Stuffed with Boudin was probably the best Quail I have ever had in my life.

While the food was delicious (as expected), what was not expected was the service. \\nOur experience started by being brought to the bar (through the active kitchen which was cool) while we waited for our table to be ready. When we were sat at the table, our waiter (Dwayne) immediately greets us, removing our napkins from our plates to return to my lap but never to my husbands. We ordered some apps and our meal and a pour of Pappy (we were impressed at the availability and range of Pappy). Upon receiving our drinks, something seemed to change with our server, Dwayne. He seemed to be annoyed by our presence and disengaged with providing the service that had be raved about. My husband and I are still unsure what we could've done to warrant a change in demeanor. While we barely got the occasional check in, 2 nearby tables were doted on. My husband never got his napkin (that he asked for back) and we were never given the opportunity to ask for another drink. By the time we finished dinner, we were eager to leave. Given it was our anniversary and that my husband notified the restaurant upon booking, we were given ice cream (sweet policy of the restaurant) that was pretty much dropped at our table. At this point, my husband and I felt that we were stuck waiting to leave and most certainly weren't going to upset Dwayne by not having the ice cream. We couldn't have signed that bill fast enough. \\nIt was a shame that the food (again, very delicious) was shadowed by horrible service.

Emeril Lagasse used to be the chef here. I made reservations a month in advance to dine at Commander's Palace. It's definitely one of the few places in New Orleans that you would need a reservation for. We walked in and were asked for our COVID vaccination cards along with the name under the reservation. We were quickly whisked upstairs to the garden room. Our servers Duwayne and Jerryd were outstanding. \\n\\nWe started with a few cocktails: Sazarac and Fuzzy Buffalo. I tried the classic Sazarac which is a typical New Orleans cocktail. It wasn't my jam so I traded my bf for his Fuzzy Buffalo. For round two, I opted for the Honey Rush, which was perfect. \\n\\nWe started with the 1-1-1 soup trio: turtle soup, gumbo, and soup du jour (potato leek). The soups are amazing and you would have a hard time choosing just one. I didn't think I'd like the turtle soup but it was delicious and reminded me of a soupy chili but in a good way. The potato soup was outstanding with its depth of flavor. The gumbo was delicious and I had plenty of gumbo on this trip. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I decided on the Gulf shrimp with greens while he had the pecan encrusted fish (Black drum). The shrimp were big and plump. The fish was delightful. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the bread pudding souffle which is their specialty. This needs to be ordered in advance because it takes 20 minutes to prepare. I really wanted the Bananas Foster but it's a two-person dessert and my bf isn't a sweets person. The souffle was poufy and they poured a liquor laced cream sauce into it which gave it a boozy flavor. It was light and boozy, much like the ambiance in New Orleans.

And  the whole process seemed to take too long. \\n\\nNow, of course, all of these secondary mistakes would easily have been overlooked if we were having fun, but we seemed to be getting punishing  for some reason or bad day, and we were really just ready to be gone.  Instead we had the service \"team\" repeatedly disappear and leave dirty dishes on the table for twenty minutes at a time.  And Then the band came. They were good, but their timing.... not so much.  We already had one foot out the door.\\n\\nThe food itself was, however, indisputably wonderful and other servers we observed seemed much more smiley, friendly and -I hope- better.  I am therefore willing to cut some slack for a bad outing and hope DeWayne pays forward the same courtesy the next time someone deigns to ask for a smaller meal or an adjustment to the menu. Or even if he\\'s just grumpy. This was my first time (others were repeat diners) and it was not a great first impression \\n\\nWe will probably try again some other time for regular lunch or dinner and keep our fingers crossed that things have improved or gotten back to what I\\'m led to believe is ordinarily an excellent experience.', 'date': '2021-11-15 07:16:06'}\n[R17] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'i1ia8lZFsYIdk02j46t1mQ', 'user_id': 'QfiLPx3kAj-iYe8jTmzQsg', 'business_id': '_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'text': \"The absolute best dining experience I had in New Orleans and it is not even close.

I believe if you are old enough and drink, try a cocktail or two (both Sazerac and Honey Rush were phenomenal), as well as an app, a soup, an entree, and dessert. You are here and you really should fully indulge. Give the turtle soup and the pecan crusted fish a try, both were some of the best food I have tried.

But otherwise everything was great and it was a really food New Orleans experience', 'date': '2022-01-03 00:38:19'}\n[R43] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'ZM0YncXSXAH7WYlud5pkIQ', 'user_id': 'tEq55WM9ea6Jl5-Ssb-CXw', 'business_id': '_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'The food is good. Our Uber driver told us this place is overrated, but I think the food is spot on. We had snails, crudo for appetizer, duck gumbo, and veal for entree. The souffle dessert is great and unique with a touch of liquor. The shortcake strawberry sauce is a bit too sweet for me.\\n\\nThe service does not match the high qualify food. It\\'s the first time I got annoyed by service. A good service should be invisible when not needed and catering when needed, not pressuring. Either the waiters were not well trained or they didn\\'t really care. At first, we couldn\\'t decide what to drink, and our waiter just stood there while we were reading the drink menu. I felt quite pressured like a student being supervised by a teacher to order a drink on the spot. I should probably tell him that I needed a minute. But I was just settling down and wasn\\'t familiar with the place to ask him to leave. And then I asked for recommendations, either the waiter really likes expensive drinks or he thinks the more expensive drink tastes better, he recommended the two most pricey drink on the menu, which didn\\'t really fit my tastebud. Then comes the entree, without telling us there was an extra charge (or maybe he did? But we definitely didn\\'t hear it), he suggested us to add crab meat in our dish, and we thought it was just part of the dish, so we agreed. Turns out there was an extra $20 for the crab. We might still order it if he told us the price, but we felt uncomfortable without being informed and then saw it on the bill. Another waiter didn\\'t do our utensils properly, making me wonder if they were trained properly. They also forgot to serve our side dish, and the waiter was busy serving several tables, so it was not easy to gesture him. Last, the check. They brought the POS machine to the table and our waiter put 25% tips and asked if it is okay. It would be REALLY awkward if a customer says \"no, I\\'d tip less. \" So I bet most customers would just say \"ok\" and let go with it. I usually only tip 25% if the service is really impressive, but for them, if I have a choice, I\\'d tip much less. Overall, the service at this place feels pressuring and not professional. \\n\\nSo good food, but no matching and unpleasant service. You can find good food elsewhere in the city with much better service.

While the food was delicious (as expected), what was not expected was the service. \\nOur experience started by being brought to the bar (through the active kitchen which was cool) while we waited for our table to be ready. When we were sat at the table, our waiter (Dwayne) immediately greets us, removing our napkins from our plates to return to my lap but never to my husbands. We ordered some apps and our meal and a pour of Pappy (we were impressed at the availability and range of Pappy). Upon receiving our drinks, something seemed to change with our server, Dwayne. He seemed to be annoyed by our presence and disengaged with providing the service that had be raved about. My husband and I are still unsure what we could've done to warrant a change in demeanor. While we barely got the occasional check in, 2 nearby tables were doted on. My husband never got his napkin (that he asked for back) and we were never given the opportunity to ask for another drink. By the time we finished dinner, we were eager to leave. Given it was our anniversary and that my husband notified the restaurant upon booking, we were given ice cream (sweet policy of the restaurant) that was pretty much dropped at our table.

Emeril Lagasse used to be the chef here. I made reservations a month in advance to dine at Commander's Palace. It's definitely one of the few places in New Orleans that you would need a reservation for. We walked in and were asked for our COVID vaccination cards along with the name under the reservation. We were quickly whisked upstairs to the garden room. Our servers Duwayne and Jerryd were outstanding. \\n\\nWe started with a few cocktails: Sazarac and Fuzzy Buffalo. I tried the classic Sazarac which is a typical New Orleans cocktail. It wasn't my jam so I traded my bf for his Fuzzy Buffalo. For round two, I opted for the Honey Rush, which was perfect. \\n\\nWe started with the 1-1-1 soup trio: turtle soup, gumbo, and soup du jour (potato leek). The soups are amazing and you would have a hard time choosing just one. I didn't think I'd like the turtle soup but it was delicious and reminded me of a soupy chili but in a good way. The potato soup was outstanding with its depth of flavor. The gumbo was delicious and I had plenty of gumbo on this trip. \\n\\nFor our entrees, I decided on the Gulf shrimp with greens while he had the pecan encrusted fish (Black drum). The shrimp were big and plump. The fish was delightful. \\n\\nFor dessert, we went with the bread pudding souffle which is their specialty. This needs to be ordered in advance because it takes 20 minutes to prepare. I really wanted the Bananas Foster but it's a two-person dessert and my bf isn't a sweets person. The souffle was poufy and they poured a liquor laced cream sauce into it which gave it a boozy flavor. It was light and boozy, much like the ambiance in New Orleans.

Kept hoping it would improve but bafflingly it got even worse. He lectured us like misbehaving children when we asked about ala carte options rather than the 3-course Prix-fix meal.  \\n\\nDid you ever think that maybe 1 or 2 of our 6 diners woke up with digestive issues that were not present when we made the reservations a month ago? We didnt want to bum anyone out or cancel, so we just kept it to ourselves and decided to try to go a little smaller. A little less snide attitude and a little more understanding from would have been much appreciated. Maybe Trust that there was a reason we somehow wanted less, not more.  Please in the future consider that there might be a legit reason a customer might want a smaller meal. \\n\\nUnfortunately this was just a mockable moment for  Dewayne.  Everyone must overindulge and be decadent and not watch calories and live-a-little and other super \"funny\"  lines of persuasion we were unnecessarily and unfortunately subjected to.  I would have loved to spend the  morning over-eating and over-drinking, but I couldn\\'t and the juvenile lame unfunny comments made it even worse. \\n\\nIn addition to the poor main service, the assistants were kind of off too. They put the drinks in front of the wrong people, then the meals in front of the wrong people, then the desserts in front of the wrong people. At some point I thought we were being punked with some kind of pathetic practical joke. It\\'s not like we switched seats or anything.  No one emptied our gumbos into our bowls, so it just sat there in its tin cup. And  the whole process seemed to take too long. \\n\\nNow, of course, all of these secondary mistakes would easily have been overlooked if we were having fun, but we seemed to be getting punishing  for some reason or bad day, and we were really just ready to be gone.  Instead we had the service \"team\" repeatedly disappear and leave dirty dishes on the table for twenty minutes at a time.  And Then the band came. They were good, but their timing.... not so much.  We already had one foot out the door.\\n\\nThe food itself was, however, indisputably wonderful and other servers we observed seemed much more smiley, friendly and -I hope- better.

Pleasant. They set a wonderful tone for the evening.

This is a true showing of Class and Customer Service. In the midst of everything that she is responsible for as an owner she took the time to come by two times in the few hours that we were there to eat our meal that is a class act. Our waitress her name was Keisha and she was fantastic, very lovely and knowledgeable of the menu and she took really good care of us. The food was fantastic and the desserts were to die for. The matrody greeted us as if we were family returning home from a vacation which was also nice. But the evening began when we arrived and the valet outside was beyond nice and accommodating for my party. He was all smiles and I wish I knew his name because he definitely deserves recognition for having been at this location for years, I remember seeing him the last time I was in town.

It\\'s the first time I got annoyed by service. A good service should be invisible when not needed and catering when needed, not pressuring. Either the waiters were not well trained or they didn\\'t really care. At first, we couldn\\'t decide what to drink, and our waiter just stood there while we were reading the drink menu. I felt quite pressured like a student being supervised by a teacher to order a drink on the spot. I should probably tell him that I needed a minute. But I was just settling down and wasn\\'t familiar with the place to ask him to leave. And then I asked for recommendations, either the waiter really likes expensive drinks or he thinks the more expensive drink tastes better, he recommended the two most pricey drink on the menu, which didn\\'t really fit my tastebud. Then comes the entree, without telling us there was an extra charge (or maybe he did? But we definitely didn\\'t hear it), he suggested us to add crab meat in our dish, and we thought it was just part of the dish, so we agreed. Turns out there was an extra $20 for the crab. We might still order it if he told us the price, but we felt uncomfortable without being informed and then saw it on the bill. Another waiter didn\\'t do our utensils properly, making me wonder if they were trained properly. They also forgot to serve our side dish, and the waiter was busy serving several tables, so it was not easy to gesture him. Last, the check. They brought the POS machine to the table and our waiter put 25% tips and asked if it is okay. It would be REALLY awkward if a customer says \"no, I\\'d tip less. \" So I bet most customers would just say \"ok\" and let go with it. I usually only tip 25% if the service is really impressive, but for them, if I have a choice, I\\'d tip much less.

It didn't taste anything like traditional barbecue. Instead, it had more of an alcoholic/ cooking wine taste to it. It also was buttery, and tangy. I really enjoyed the shrimp.\\n\\n- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($23): This was absolutely life-changing and hands down the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor of this pasta was so unique and it's something I had never tasted before. The fettuccine pasta was tossed in a creamy creole sauce and had bits of alligator and shrimp in it. It was colorful, well-seasoned, and just flawless. Though creamy and flavorful, the pasta didn't feel too heavy. I feel like people don't think about ordering pasta in New Orleans, or at least I certainly did not, but you have to give this a try. \\n\\n- Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e ($18): the etouffee is a stew with a ball of rice in it and it's topped with bits of crawfish. Winter is not crawfish season, so I was glad to try a bit through the etouffee. Again, the seasoning for anything cajun is just so on point. \\n\\n- Fried Soft Shell Crab ($8): Gotta have crabs when you're in New Orleans but I actually struggled to find places with fried soft shell crabs. Fortunately, Oceana had it. I just wanted a taste, so I ordered one crab. It came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The crab was so good and had a texture comparable to shrimp tempura. \\n\\nI had Oceana Grill on my first night in New Orleans and it was a great start to the trip. All these flavors were so new to me and worked so well with every dish. My only complaint is that when you order take-out they give you something like Hawaiian bread instead of toasted baguette slices. Other than that, I loved all the food here and highly recommend it. \\n\\nTips and Notes:\\n- If you order pickup online through their website, there is a slight discount for first-time users. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing, but something to keep in mind. \\n- Most of the regular dishes had appetizer/ smaller sized dishes for you to taste and try. So, if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to get, you can get tons of mini dishes.\", 'date': '2022-01-13 18:26:47'}\n[R29] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'gWg-xcPHSTxaeKWiLr_mwg', 'user_id': '_3YwOzuBgxBUKFCSG7mXvg', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Excellent Service\\nExcellent food\\nExcellent ambience\\nExcellent drinks\\nEverything about this place was amazing, from the gator bites to the Redfish', 'date': '2022-01-14 00:30:28'}\n[R30] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'viuqhHquWLTiA9GrAxjsaw', 'user_id': 's0Zfw0eOahU0716H7e2mEw', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Great food and even better service!

It was hot, seemed fresh enough, and came quickly.  That\\'s about it... It was not bad, but it definitely was not a standout experience either.  It was an ok experience and makes sense that it was so easy to get into versus some of the other establishments that had huge lines.

We ordered to-go both times, and our food was always ready fast and packaged well to avoid any leakage during transportation. \\n\\nThoughts on the following:\\n- Barbecued Shrimp ($25): The BBQ shrimp is a NOLA classic you have to try, though I would say the name is a bit misleading. It didn't taste anything like traditional barbecue. Instead, it had more of an alcoholic/ cooking wine taste to it. It also was buttery, and tangy. I really enjoyed the shrimp.\\n\\n- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($23): This was absolutely life-changing and hands down the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor of this pasta was so unique and it's something I had never tasted before. The fettuccine pasta was tossed in a creamy creole sauce and had bits of alligator and shrimp in it. It was colorful, well-seasoned, and just flawless. Though creamy and flavorful, the pasta didn't feel too heavy. I feel like people don't think about ordering pasta in New Orleans, or at least I certainly did not, but you have to give this a try. \\n\\n- Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e ($18): the etouffee is a stew with a ball of rice in it and it's topped with bits of crawfish. Winter is not crawfish season, so I was glad to try a bit through the etouffee. Again, the seasoning for anything cajun is just so on point. \\n\\n- Fried Soft Shell Crab ($8): Gotta have crabs when you're in New Orleans but I actually struggled to find places with fried soft shell crabs. Fortunately, Oceana had it. I just wanted a taste, so I ordered one crab. It came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The crab was so good and had a texture comparable to shrimp tempura. \\n\\nI had Oceana Grill on my first night in New Orleans and it was a great start to the trip. All these flavors were so new to me and worked so well with every dish. My only complaint is that when you order take-out they give you something like Hawaiian bread instead of toasted baguette slices. Other than that, I loved all the food here and highly recommend it. \\n\\nTips and Notes:\\n- If you order pickup online through their website, there is a slight discount for first-time users. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing, but something to keep in mind. \\n- Most of the regular dishes had appetizer/ smaller sized dishes for you to taste and try. So, if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to get, you can get tons of mini dishes.\", 'date': '2022-01-13 18:26:47'}\n[R29] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'gWg-xcPHSTxaeKWiLr_mwg', 'user_id': '_3YwOzuBgxBUKFCSG7mXvg', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Excellent Service\\nExcellent food\\nExcellent ambience\\nExcellent drinks\\nEverything about this place was amazing, from the gator bites to the Redfish', 'date': '2022-01-14 00:30:28'}\n[R30] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'viuqhHquWLTiA9GrAxjsaw', 'user_id': 's0Zfw0eOahU0716H7e2mEw', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Great food and even better service!

We ordered to-go both times, and our food was always ready fast and packaged well to avoid any leakage during transportation. \\n\\nThoughts on the following:\\n- Barbecued Shrimp ($25): The BBQ shrimp is a NOLA classic you have to try, though I would say the name is a bit misleading. It didn't taste anything like traditional barbecue. Instead, it had more of an alcoholic/ cooking wine taste to it. It also was buttery, and tangy. I really enjoyed the shrimp.\\n\\n- Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($23): This was absolutely life-changing and hands down the best pasta I've ever had. The flavor of this pasta was so unique and it's something I had never tasted before. The fettuccine pasta was tossed in a creamy creole sauce and had bits of alligator and shrimp in it. It was colorful, well-seasoned, and just flawless. Though creamy and flavorful, the pasta didn't feel too heavy. I feel like people don't think about ordering pasta in New Orleans, or at least I certainly did not, but you have to give this a try. \\n\\n- Crawfish Etouff\u00e9e ($18): the etouffee is a stew with a ball of rice in it and it's topped with bits of crawfish. Winter is not crawfish season, so I was glad to try a bit through the etouffee. Again, the seasoning for anything cajun is just so on point. \\n\\n- Fried Soft Shell Crab ($8): Gotta have crabs when you're in New Orleans but I actually struggled to find places with fried soft shell crabs. Fortunately, Oceana had it. I just wanted a taste, so I ordered one crab. It came with a cocktail dipping sauce. The crab was so good and had a texture comparable to shrimp tempura. \\n\\nI had Oceana Grill on my first night in New Orleans and it was a great start to the trip. All these flavors were so new to me and worked so well with every dish. My only complaint is that when you order take-out they give you something like Hawaiian bread instead of toasted baguette slices. Other than that, I loved all the food here and highly recommend it. \\n\\nTips and Notes:\\n- If you order pickup online through their website, there is a slight discount for first-time users. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing, but something to keep in mind. \\n- Most of the regular dishes had appetizer/ smaller sized dishes for you to taste and try. So, if you're overwhelmed and don't know what to get, you can get tons of mini dishes.\", 'date': '2022-01-13 18:26:47'}\n[R29] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'gWg-xcPHSTxaeKWiLr_mwg', 'user_id': '_3YwOzuBgxBUKFCSG7mXvg', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Excellent Service\\nExcellent food\\nExcellent ambience\\nExcellent drinks\\nEverything about this place was amazing, from the gator bites to the Redfish', 'date': '2022-01-14 00:30:28'}\n[R30] {'_type': 'review', 'review_id': 'viuqhHquWLTiA9GrAxjsaw', 'user_id': 's0Zfw0eOahU0716H7e2mEw', 'business_id': 'ac1AeYqs8Z4_e2X5M3if2A', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Great food and even better service!
