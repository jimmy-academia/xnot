Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED -

Ricci's has been in business since 1920 and any business that can not only survive, but flourish after hitting a century mark, has to be doing something right. \\n\\nHoagies ate a Philadelphia staple and definitely a food of the working man. A hoagie allows someone to eat something substantial in a quick an efficient manner. You don't have to worry about a fork and knife to help you in eating it. I heard somewhere that a sandwich was a favorite amongst truckers because they could eat it while driving. I do not know about the authenticity of the story, but it makes sense. But I think what allowed hoagies (or subs, grinders, whatever you want to call them) to survive is that they also taste great.\\n\\nI can say that a hoagie is one of my favorite meals. It is a perfect culmination of bread, meats, cheeses, veggies, vinegar, oil and spices and has been embraced worldwide as a lunch (or donner) favorite. Ricci's do hoagies right and as it continues to get handed down through the generations, I hope that they continue to flourish.\\n\\nSo, after over a hundred years, the community still loves Ricci's and after eating here, you will understand why. My go-to hoagie has always been an Italian and they do their Italian right. It is a substantial meal at a fair price and it is something that you will return to Ricci's again and again for.\\n\\nAs Ricci's enters into their second century, they still produce an outstanding product. With them continuing to do so, I can see them making it another century and beyond.\", 'date': '2022-01-11 14:07:02', 'user': {'name': 'John', 'review_count': 3148, 'yelping_since': '2018-08-03 12:39:48', 'elite': '2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.0, 'fans': 87}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'b-pSMWmJdNVh7qnQf3AR4A', 'user_id': 'OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg', 'business_id': 'Bih0eT_lbbCUwKmGYpX0hw', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 3, 'text': \"Fantastic hoagies.

I love seeded rolls and this place had them. I will NOT eat at a shop that doesn't have seeded rolls with the exception of Chick's in jersey. The ratio of meat to cheese to bread was spot on.

Most ppl know that If you want a official, authentic South Philly tasting hoagie whether you from Sp or not, this is one of the heavy hitters in the whole city for hoagies. This coming from a dude that's from Southwest, but the two so close it ain't impossible but it's doesn't take away from the fact though.\\n\\n  My hoagies were a Turkey and cheese, and an Italian. The rolls are real soft with no signs of dryness down to the ends. The turkey was very, very fresh most likely also because they slice the meat as soon as you order. Fresh lettuce, juicy pickles, tasty onions, peppers, and creamy flavourful mayonaise. All this made me realize even at my age now and 20yrs later they may never fall off which is legend.\\n\\n  So to anybody curious about where and who in Sp have one of the best hoagies whether you not from the city or even If you are from here but never discovered Ricci's, Come here.

The eggplant appetizer was the best thing of the night, but was very small, comparable to a square of lasagna.  The grilled calamari was good too, well done with a fresh little salad.  Neither of the appetizers were very good for sharing though. All of the dishes were well done.  My veil cantaloni was good, the blush sauce tasted wonderful.

In truth if it were my restaurant I don't think it would even occur to me to fit a table against the wall next to the hallway but I wasn't going to let that get me down it was a special night and I was still looking forward to my meal.\\n\\nAppetizers\\n\\nThere was a limited menu for New Years eve so I was unable to order the grilled octopus appetizer that I was really looking forward to.  Instead I ordered the soup of the day which was an 8 dollar bowl of bland and uninteresting lentil soup.  For 8 dollars they might want to look into a sausage and lentil option because I can't imagine anyone getting excited for the current version which is not dissimilar to a can of progresso. In addition to the lentil soup we also ordered the stuffed eggplant which was similar to one medium sized square of Eggplant lasagna again nothing to write home about.  The eggplant was over salted but it was almost a pleasant surprise in comparison to underseasoned lentil soup.\\n\\nMain Course\\n\\nMy girlfriend was so excited they had the sweet potato gnocchi on the menu this is one of her favorite dishes.  All I can say is it must have been an off night for the gnocchi because that was easily the worst gnocchi I've ever had.  It was so bland and the texture was so soft, it was kind of like eating gnocchi made from Elmer's glue absolutely terrible I have no idea what everyone is raving about.  I had the Veil Marsala which again was pretty bland.  The meat was nicely cooked but the sauce and pasta left loads to be desired.  \\n\\nDessert was a slice of chocolate ganache with whipped cream it was good but not the most creative dish \\n\\nI'd give this place 2 stars I wouldn't waste my time going back.  Like I said maybe I hold Italian byob's to a higher standard.  When I go out to eat Italian I like food that's at least on par with my own cooking at home and this was a far cry.

It certainly sounded like what we were hoping to find: a small local place with a unique feel that had good tortellini (it was my daughter's 10th birthday and that's one of her faves).\\n\\nSo I don't know. Maybe it's one of those places that has variable quality, that sometimes has a down night because the cook's girlfriend left him or bad weather made everyone perform poorly. If that's the case, the cook's girlfriend has been really really nice to him and the weather was great yesterday, so Hosteria da Elio really knocked it out of the park for us.\\n\\nThe front room here is very not impressive, but that's not what you should go for. When the weather is nice (and, to re-state my earlier... uh, statement, the weather was fantastically gorgeous last night), the back patio is the epitome of what you want a restaurant's outdoor dining area to be like. Beautiful plants, very serene, cozy, just fantastic. The wine was great, because of course it's BYOB and we had a very nice chardonnay and a cold Sierra Nevada. The service was great, not pushy or fast moving, but well paced for the evening.\\n\\nAs for the food, we started with the eggplant parmesan appetizer as well as a gorgonzola salad. Again, in comparison with some other reviews where people talked about not being able to find the eggplant in their eggplant parmesan, our experience could not have been more different. The eggplant was sliced amazingly thin, lightly breaded, then layered thickly into a two-inch thick chunk of meltingly tender delicious goodness. The best eggplant dish I've ever had except for one spicy eggplant dish I had at a now-defunct Chinese in Santa Cruz, CA.\\n\\nThe tortellini with white sauce was tortellini with white sauce, well executed with bits of prosciutto and really tasty fresh sweet peas, but not anywhere off the range, as it were. Which of course is just what a 10-year-old wants from her tortellini.\\n\\nMy wife had the sweet potato gnocchi, which was, hands down, the best gnocchi I've ever had. I should interject here, I've lived in Florida, San Francisco, and St. Louis, all of which have quality Italian food, and been to New York and Italy as well, so I've had lots of gnocchi, good gnocchi, and my wife's a huge fan. This stuff blew us both away. Absolutely fantastic. It melted in your mouth, no chewiness or elasticity at all, but full of flavor.\\n\\nFor my dinner, I had the veal cannelloni with blush sauce. I seldom eat veal (for the obvious reasons, but it's so tasty that I sometimes break down and have it), so when I do, I really want it to deliver. This cannelloni delivered. And how. I'm used to cannelloni basically being like a meatball wrapped in a crepe. That's OK: when done well, it's a very tasty meatball. But the minced or ground meat has usually solidified into a mostly coherent structure. Not in this one. The meat was very finely minced and mixed with herbs and fell apart once you took a bite of it. The blush sauce gave a nice bit of sweetness and acidity to the dish, but didn't overwhelm the subtle flavor of the filling.\\n\\nThe portions were perfect, with no left-overs to take home, but our bellies well sated. The price was good, mid-range basically. We did not try the cannoli as many suggested, since my daughter wanted to go out for an ice cream cone afterwards and she's the boss.\\n\\nWe probably won't be back in Philadelphia all that often but when we are I would definitely make this a can't-miss place on each trip.\", 'date': '2013-08-05 20:03:48', 'user': {'name': 'Rick', 'review_count': 11, 'yelping_since': '2010-09-19 14:45:36', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.5, 'fans': 0}}\n[R19] {'review_id': 'FehiO_lb13NHSeogGN9y2A', 'user_id': 'zJrrf2WP9xvZAsNl8ssTqQ', 'business_id': 'gKZuvwFRHcO2Y6XfyWO7lA', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Oh I loved this place.

We had a larger group reservation and they took us to their private back room dining room on the second floor. Walking through, I felt like royalty. It had strong lounge-feel vibes and the darker lighting and red decor theme gave me really high expectations. The dining room I believe is traditionally used for meetings because of the TV on the wall and board room-esque seating, but we were happy with the view.\\n\\nWe started the night with cocktails and also ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. This is where the night started to go downhill. The cocktails were not as good as people raved. My Ginger Kiss and my friends Comcastini tasted very watered-down and for lack of better words, cheap. Our stomachs started rumbling and we went right to ordering.\\n\\nI went with the pasta a la norma and got a large platter of antipasto misto for the table for appetizers. The wait time was noticeably long, about 25 minutes before we actually saw some food. I will say, the portions are huge. The pasta was sized like an entree and I was able to give multiple people at the table a good portion to taste. However, it was very simple, something I\\'m sure I could throw together in my own kitchen. The antipasto was also very pretty, but nothing special, just a bunch of meats and pickled veggies on a wooden platter.\\n\\nFor the second course, I got the wild black cod. This course was miserable. I still have no idea what it was, but there was something in the oil that the fish was fried in that gave it a very very undesirable aftertaste. It was similar to the effect of adding too much MSG, but my tongue wasn\\'t tingling. It just felt like I was whiffing wafts of salty, spicy air. I couldn\\'t take more than one bite a minute. The celery root puree was also strangely flavored. Both me and a friend noted it tasted very similar to cup noodle seasoning packets and it just wasn\\'t impressive at all. The presentation was beautiful, but that\\'s it.\\n\\nThe dessert was also not impressive. The flavor of the semifreddo was okay, but it was so frozen that it was hard to cut through and the berries in the middle were rock hard. Definitely not an ideal finish to the meal.\\n\\nAnother thing to note was the music. I noticed it right away as we were ordering drinks and all I could hear was, \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" The remainder of our night was accompanied with 70\\'s and 80\\'s pop music, which definitely wasn\\'t fitting with the decor. \\n\\nFood was definitely not worth the price.

While eating my food, I thought to myself \"this food is on par with Chili\\'s or TGIFriday\\'s\".\\n\\nTable 31 reverse engineered restaurant week with the thought process of \"ok each person pays $35, how do we profit from that?\"\\n\\nFor our first courses, we ordered carpaccio and lasagna.  The lasagna was dry as it must have been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour or two.  It was on par with cafeteria lasagna.  As for the carpaccio, it was the coup de grace of the meal.  I would rate carpaccio as my top 10 favorite dishes.  In fact, my wife looked at all of the restaurant week participants and picked Table 31 as a surprise because she knows how much I love carpaccio!  I love the raw red meat, sliced so thinly that you can cut it with a fork.  \\n\\nThe waiter puts the carpaccio in front of me, and at first I thought that they forgot to put the carpaccio on my plate.  I realized that the carpaccio was white and blended into the plate.  It was plated with arugula, parmesan and a vinaigrette.  I am guessing it was pork, but honestly it tasted like turkey lunch meat.  The edge of the slices of meat were brown which meant to me that it was cooked somehow, and it tasted as if it was oven roasted.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  If someone gave me a plate of lunch meat and a salad, I may have preferred that over the carpaccio I had.\\n\\nNext, we ordered the oven roasted chicken, the eggplant parmesan and a side of meatballs.  My wife\\'s chicken was actually pretty good.  My eggplant was piping hot.  I could not touch it for about 5 minutes.  After waiting for a while, I finally took a bite and it burned my mouth a little bit, so much so that it took me another 5 minutes to actually taste eggplant.  The meatballs had way too much garlic.\\n\\nFor the dessert, we had the chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and panna cotta.  The chocolate creme brulee stunk.  We didn\\'t even finish it.  Who doesn\\'t finish chocolate!  My wife actually said \"I mean, this doesn\\'t taste good.  I feel like I am wasting calories by eating this.\"  With the panna cotta, it was ok not great.  The funniest thing about the whole meal was that on the panna cotta, they plated an assortment of fruits that were cut in half.  We got half a blueberry, not a full blueberry but a half a blueberry!  Who does that!  If the restaurant is too damn cheap to splurge on blueberries, then don\\'t plate them!!!!!!  Oh and the blackberry was cut in half length wise, very weird.\\n\\nThis was probably the worst meal that I have eaten in Philadelphia in the 10 years that I have lived here.  And it cost me $150!  I am not that much of a foodie snob, but the meal was so bad that I was forced to create a yelp account to complain.\\n\\nPlease do not waste your time and money on Table 31.  There are so many great restaurants in Philly these days that are 1000x better than this place.\\n\\nIf you like:\\n-Lunch meat and salads\\n-Mouth burning food\\n-Garlic\\n-Wasted calories\\n-Half of a blueberry\\n\\nThen by all means, don\\'t let my review discourage you.', 'date': '2012-10-12 01:17:07', 'user': {'name': 'Mark', 'review_count': 1, 'yelping_since': '2012-10-12 00:47:24', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 1.0, 'fans': 0}}\n[R21] {'review_id': 'wmzYgWN3JkuhltwlcYvQUA', 'user_id': 'qb93lt68RXCsrmAc9AYJeQ', 'business_id': '2BRbu3cBbH2bCgzN3DVc8w', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"This place is such a joke. \\n\\nFirst of all, they are ridiculously overpriced. The quality of food varies from decent to well below average to being served cold black coffee. I think they're trying to cut a lot of corners lately and just ride out a previously well-earned reputation of being a nice Philly spot for fine dining, but that Table 31 is long gone and all that remains now is a very transparent attempt at being something they are clearly not.\\n\\nI thought the hostess up front was rather rude, first pointing out that a friend of mine wasn't dressed appropriately but that she would need to check with her manager to see if it was a forgivable offense. Is that the actual restaurant policy? Last I checked, when your business is sitting around completely empty, and five people who were decent enough to make a reservation show up, you seat them with a smile, not a stop sign, regardless of what color shoes or pants they're wearing. Luckily the manager has half a brain and motioned that it was totally cool, but the pretentious hostess still felt the need to educate us on how to dress at a fine dining establishment. Clearly, she needed a way to feel important. Glad we could help.\\n\\nThe food was unfortunately pretty inconsistent. We had some decent appetizers and that was about as far as we got. The entrees were all over the place, some being completely offensive, others being decent, and the rest just showing some laziness in preparation.\\n\\nWe continually had to ask the waitress to come back to help us since she was focused on pandering for her tip at a table of old rich people. \\n\\nLater we were handed serving spoons for eating our desserts, which in retrospect, I wish I hadn't ordered because it was forgettable at best.\\n\\n\\nDefinitely will not come back, and will also mention to others that it's not worth going to.\", 'date': '2012-10-01 00:30:30', 'user': {'name': 'Rizwan', 'review_count': 199, 'yelping_since': '2011-06-18 11:57:49', 'elite': '2011,2012,2013,2014,2015', 'average_stars': 2.93, 'fans': 13}}\n[R22] {'review_id': 'KxAmnJFUGicKnlZ4j1de2w', 'user_id': '5G2IF0VIN3Brl-m45QDXsA', 'business_id': '2BRbu3cBbH2bCgzN3DVc8w', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'No more Insalata Funghi?

It was on a Wednesday in the summer so we were there during Center City Sips, but were passing our time at the inside bar which doesn't do Sips before our dinner reservation in the Table 31 dining room. We had a lovely time at the bar, but everything went bad when we went to the hostess stand to be seated for dinner.\\n\\nThe hostess was condescending and rude.  She handed out the dinner menus while we were standing there to be seated as she stated that we would have to order from the dinner menu which is more expensive than the bar menu..  The implication seemed to be that we couldn't afford dinner..?  The waiter also got in on the poor service act stating us that he would need the table back in two hours.  I'm not sure what sort of establishment tries to hurry dinner guests along, but we should have left before we were seated as the evening would have gone better for everyone involved if we had never stepped into that dining room.  The waiter was ironically slow and despite our best efforts to eat and get the heck out of there, dinner still took an hour and a half.  Well below his two hour request, but we couldn't get out of there quick enough.  He was condescending throughout our dinner and unattentive and he should not be in a part of the food service industry that requires him to deal with customers. \\n\\nI don't understand what could have have happened to make these folks look down on our group of 30-something professionals, so I can only assume this is how they treat all their customers.

It was honestly some of the best polenta I've ever had... not at all heavy, perfectly seasoned, and with just a slight tang from what I assume was goat cheese. The pulled pork was great too, but I'd bathe in that polenta.

The place was already buzzing with activity with most of the tables filled with dinner guests. The service was impeccable with our BYOB wine being uncorked, water glasses filled and a basket of fresh crusty Italian bread with dipping olive oil arriving at our table within minutes of being seated. The menu is extensive with many interesting Italian specialties. Only a seasoned chef can handle so many wonderful dishes on a daily basis! In most eateries a couple of these dishes would be offered only as the dinner special. So, we started with Polipo Fantasia which is grilled octopus with capers, pur\u00e9ed ceci beans and sun dried tomatoes, finished with olive oil and balsamic glaze. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the pur\u00e9ed chick beans was fabulous. Not a humus but a delicious dipping sauce. A second appetizer plate was Calamari Fritti which is traditional fried calamari but these were served in a sweet and spicy chili sauce. A really great mixtures of flavor between the sweet & spicy but adding to the explosion of flavor were the fried calamari. The calamari were crisp, tender and not chewy or greasy! The final appetizer plate was Antipasto which is Chef Tony\\'s selection of an assortment of Italian specialty meats, cheese, and vegetables that included thinly sliced soppressata, salami, prosciutto, provolone, pecorino and mozzarella cheeses, pickled eggplant, roasted peppers, fresh and sundried tomatoes...yep another culinary delight! Some in our party had eaten here before and knew their go to pasta dish was Fettuccine Pugliese that\\'s squid ink fettuccine with shrimp and crab meat, served in a cheese bowl with white wine sauce. I tried Gnocchi Mascarpone con Aragosta which is mascarpone gnocchi saut\u00e9ed with lobster and typically finished with a touch of tomato and cream, but I skipped the tomato and cream and the Chef accommodated my request for an arrabiata sauce. Each gnocchi was stuffed with a dab of mascarpone and cooked to perfection! For my taste the lobster in arrabiata sauce was heaven! All four pasta plates were sparkling clean from our \"scarpetta.\" The dinner was topped off with espressos and orders of strawberry and hazelnut gelatos!

We ordered another special of the night that was even worse than our starter; the veal was gray, slathered with a white gelatinous sauce--a texture that suggested the sauce might have been canned. We also ordered the Antonio pizza, which is topped with prosciutto, arugula, and oil. It was the driest pizza I've ever eaten. Giving them one last shot, we ordered the pistachio cake for dessert. The pistachio cake seemed to be an angel-like cake with cannoli filling. On brand with the rest of our meal, the pistachio cake left more to be desired; it simply lacked flavor.

I had been wanting to try this place since I heard about his pizza on One Bite Pizza Reviews. He started making pizza at home for friends and was shipping them out in the mail during Covid. He opened a brick and mortar store in November 2020 but I hadn't gotten Dowtown until today. After snagging a coveted spot on 3rd street, we made our way to the shop. The location is across from Sonny's on Market. The decor and signage is great and features what you came for ......Pizza! Not just any pizza, excellent pizza!\\nAngelo Pizza (Yeah, that is the owner's name) is creating artisan pies that are incredible and as advertised.\\nMeeting Angelo himself, at the register, was a treat. You can tell how passionate he is about what he does in the quality of the product and how personable he is to his customers. We went with two selections...The Angelo Pizza and The Not Pepperoni Pizza. My wife is more of a purist so the Angelo was her pick. It was fantastic! Great blend of cheese, the right amount of sauce and thin, crispy crust. It is a spectacular straight up cheese pizza that will have you eating slice after slice until it is all gone! For my choice, The Not Pepperoni, there was no doubt you would never go back to pepperoni again. It was covered with soppressata and roasted red peppers. Both combine on an already perfect pie to create the right amount of spice with the cheese blend. It really is an epiphany if you have never had sopressata before on your pizza! The dough and it's perfect crust are really the flavor base that have you eating slice after slice.  One other touch with each pizza is a whole, hot cherry pepper. These add a great flavor note to the pizza as well!\\nSorry if I did not take any pizza pictures! We were too busy eating it. \\nDo yourself a favor, go and get this pizza.

I first met Angelo many years ago in the Little Italy district of Baltimore.  My wife and I got to know Angelo and his family very well. They are individuals that believe in community, family, and helping out those less fortunate. We were very excited to see the Portnoy review of Angelo's homemade pizzas, and we were equally excited to see him following his dream.\\n\\nWe bought about 10 frozen pizzas right after the Barstool review and could not have been happier. When we picked them up in Baltimore, Angelo made us a special pie which we shared on the street. It was, and is a great memory. So we were very happy when Angelo got the opportunity to open up his own shop in Philadelphia. Living in Boston, we really looked forward to making the trip to Philly to support our friend.\\n\\nWe finally had an opportunity to try Angelo's Pizza the Saturday before the Super Bowl. Though all the pizzas looked great I had to order the Pauli's, as I was really looking forward to trying the meatballs. We did order the larger size pie which was available just for the weekend. When the pizza arrived at our table, we were blown away by not only how perfectly it was cooked, but also the amazing smell. This truly was a piece of art. I could go into a great detail about all of the individual ingredients, however I will just say that the pizza was extraordinary. Every aspect was spot on and I particularly enjoyed the basil placed underneath the cheese, actually part of the sauce. I did not think Angelo could make a better pizza. It truly was on a par with some of my absolute favorites such as Di Fara, Mozza, Scarr's, and being a Boston guy, Santarpio's. Each one of those has it's own unique style, and The Angelo's Pizza, more than any of them, seems to be a reflection of Angelo himself. It was very evident that the pizza really was developed with a certain person and feeling in mind. It was almost as if each pizza is a personalized letter from Angelo.\\n\\nI talk about each pizza because before we left we ordered three more pizzas to take home.  After careful consideration, we ordered the Noni, the Not Pepperoni, and the Saint Antney's. These were not pizzas with just a bunch of toppings on them, rather they were pizzas developed to send a certain message and reflect something meaningful in Angelo's life. At least that was my take.  I loved each and every one of them and I could not even pick a favorite.\\n\\nKeep in mind, we ordered the regular size pizzas for the ones we took home. I highly recommend sticking with the smaller or regular size pizza as Angelo has fine-tuned the recipe to ensure that the smaller pizza is absolutely optimal.\\n\\nI don't need to go into great details on each of the pizzas, as others clearly have done that. Angelo will not create custom pies but he will remove items from each individual pie off of the original recipe. Take my advice, and have the pizzas as they were intended, they are all absolutely outstanding.\\n\\nThe Noni is a white pie with the sausage and broccoli rabe.  Every pizza is cooked to perfection so there is no need to go into details in that area. However the toppings,  crust, and sauce were just incredible. I absolutely loved this pizza.\\n\\nI am not a big sausage, pepper, and onion guy, so I did not think the Saint Antney's was going to be a real hit with me. Boy was I wrong! The entire pizza is incredibly well crafted, and just the right amount of each ingredient is put on to ensure that no one flavor dominates the pizza. It was truly outstanding.\\n\\nThe Not Pepperoni pizza includes soppressata and red pepper.  This is just simply a step up and elevates the pizza to another level. It is not a simple pepperoni pizza. Again the preparation, quality of the ingredients, and attention to detail adds an element that really cannot be adequately described in words.\\n\\nWe took these three pizzas home to Boston. Over the next three days, my wife and I finished off the three pizzas. We did share one pie with a couple friends who were just blown away by the quality of the pizza and immediately checked how long it would take to drive to Philly to get one themselves.\\n\\nI will be 100% transparent, I have never rooted for someone more or wanted to post a positive review more than I did for Angelo. However, I would never post something on Yelp that was not 100% true. As I stated, I would put this pizza right up there with my all-time favorites. So while I am very happy to write this review, Angelo has certainly earned it and I'm sure that he will continue to build his business and become a major success. If you want to have a pizza that truly reflects the owner and provides a personal experience, I strongly suggest you go to The  Angelo's Pizza. you will not be disappointed.\", 'date': '2021-02-15 03:29:27', 'user': {'name': 'Mark', 'review_count': 158, 'yelping_since': '2010-12-28 16:33:19', 'elite': '2016,2017,2021', 'average_stars': 4.3, 'fans': 2}}\n[R38] {'review_id': 'CrmzXBo-qbgyY4fM5_6dLA', 'user_id': 'M5QAuzQB9ee0ntf9RKkx7Q', 'business_id': 'nmeGoVi_U-bbnojJsi52Aw', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 5, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 2, 'text': \"Recently moved nearby and walked passed here several times before finally caving in to the temptation.

At Angelo, personal pies only, without additions or substitutions (although they will exclude any ingredients if you ask).\\n\\nI opted for The Pauli -- a pie topped with \"real nice\" meatballs. For something so simple, the pizza was also polarizing! The crust was limp in the middle, and the first few bites of each slice sagged depressingly. However, closer to the edges, the crust was surprisingly crisp and tasty. Moreover, the taste of each topping was spot on. The slightly tart sauce and herby meatball transported me back to pasta dinners of my childhood.\\n\\nAt $16 dollars for a 12\" pie (marginally larger than a personal pie), my wallet felt noticeably lighter after my visit.

If I hadn't grown up in the metro NYC area, I would have given the place 5 stars.\", 'date': '2021-01-23 23:36:56', 'user': {'name': 'Caitlin', 'review_count': 13, 'yelping_since': '2017-10-07 23:12:41', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 4.38, 'fans': 0}}\n[R42] {'review_id': 'wQstL4cVEmiDmlKcShkLiw', 'user_id': '_pzPGi1g2hCP_dVvS0OsvQ', 'business_id': 'nmeGoVi_U-bbnojJsi52Aw', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Waited over 40 minutes for the pizza, when they told others the wait was 20 minutes.

He grew up slinging pies in his father\\'s  shop in Baltimore. (Yes, he\\'s a Raven\\'s fan, but a secondary Eagles fan so don\\'t crucify him. He even has a lie named \\'The Carson\\'). He came to Philly to attend St Joe\\'s and never left. Recently, during the pandemic, he opened his fun little simple shop. The prime real estate was surprisingly very affordable because of covid.\\n\\nAngelo & I chatted quite a bit. We talked sports, and Portnoy, obviously. He told me where to get the best pizza in Baltimore and we bonded over both of our favorite pizza in the world (besides his), Frank Pepe\\'s in New Haven. He\\'s adorable, knowledgeable of his craft, and super friendly. Felt good to support him. \\n\\nThe traffic was steady on football Sunday and I was afraid because of their \"12 pies, strict no substitutions\" policy it would be insane to grab a pie. You know how all the best places in the city nowadays you have to jump through hoops to secure your pizza, but luckily it wasn\\'t bad. At all! A little wait, but the convo made the time fly. \\n\\nWe ordered a plain that claims to be \"the best f*ckong cheese pizza\" and the \\'Charlie Bananas\\' which \" like Charlie, (a guy from the old neighborhood as Angelo told me) this one is a hit with the ladies\". Banana peppers and sharp provolone...give me! They were both excellent! The peppers packed just the amount of punch and the sharp provolone was such an unexpected twist! The added pepper to box was a sweet touch. The sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and acidity, and although I\\'m not a crust gal, this was thin and very crispy! Yum!! Absolutely delish! \\n\\nAll and all we were very satisfied with our stop and will be back again for sure. \\n\\nWe would definitely recommend grabbing some! \\'The Pauli\\' (meatball) is Angelo\\'s favorite and I definitely want to try the white pie with mushrooms, \\'The Carson\\' next time! \\nThey ship frozen pies too.\\nBest of luck, Ang!

The Alfredo I'm still not sure what kind of magic they do to not have the sauce separate when reheating, but it's really tasty.  My favorite is the creamy shallot sauce though.  This one is lick the spoon good.  They also have fresh cut pasta where you tell them the cut and they cut it as you wait a minute.

I must say things have changed a lot, good and not so good. \\nLet's start with the food and drinks. They have a fantastic selection of items, and specials on the menu.  From escarole soup to steak and lobster. They also have a very enticing dessert tray! I tried the veal piccante. It was very tender and tasted quite lovely. We also tried the langostinas, they were on the specials menu. Also very well prepared, presented, and delicious. All the main dishes are a la carte. Sides include sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, sauteed escarole, and there was also a brussel sprout side added. There are two bars, one upstairs and one on the main dining area as you walk in. The bars are beautiful and well stocked.  They have a decent wine and cocktail menu.  I decided to try the Vesper, it was very good! \\nWhat's changed? The price of food here is very high! Too high for the area, the type of cuisine (Italian), and for a casual restaurant not known for great cuisine made by well known chefs. There are many top restaurants in the city with comparable pricing, or lower. It would be quite a challenge to dine here again simply based on the very high priced items.  Please take this into consideration! \\nBread.  Not good at all! Our bread came out in a small basket and was frozen in the center. Appeared to have been warmed up very quickly. It was not fresh or tasty.  In fact, this almost ruined my appetite.  I didn't mention this to the server because I had already decided this was not typical or satisfactory; and I didn't really need to eat bread that badly anyway. \\nComplementary parking.  They have a couple lots to park at.  They were both full.  However there is a valet that will park your car. He will let you know he works for tips. Be good to him. I would recommend taking a taxi, Uber/Lyft to the restaurant..  It would save you time and the aggravation of driving around trying to find a parking space, or tipping the friendly valet. \\nSaloon has beautiful old world decor.  Lots of beautiful carved wood and nice artwork throughout.  To be quite frank, it's a little too busy.  The restaurant is very clean.  The service was very good! Everyone here is well dressed and appeared to enjoy doing their job.  They were very welcoming from entering and leaving. \\nOverall, Saloon was a disappointment, despite being a traditional South Philly landmark. I was not happy with the prices here at all. Especially since it was a la carte. I probably won't come back, but I feel you should at least give it a try, take your chances. Be prepared to spend at least $70 or more per person.

I also really appreciate the free parking lot they provide since parking in south Philly can be a pain. The food here is simply next level. Everything I've gotten has come out fresh, flavorful, and amazing. Portions are very generous and good for sharing. Service overall is top notch.

This was the most expensive meal I have ever had. Granted, we ate 3.5 courses and each one was delicious. But that bill was a whammy.\\n\\nWe actually planned to go somewhere else for dinner because on this particular Saturday night, Saloon was all booked up at the time we wanted to eat and we couldn\\'t make a reservation. Long story short, we ended up here anyway and it was only 15 minute wait for 2 people. We waited at the downstairs bar and got a round of drinks (wine for me, beer for boo). Lots of nostalgia in that area! It reminded me of my grandmoms house in the 80s with the knick knacks and such - and I mean that as a compliment!!\\n\\nOur wait was truly about 15 minutes as promised, and then we went on a long walk up the stairs and around the corner to our table. I didn\\'t realize how huge this place was inside so I guess that\\'s why, even with no reservations, they could still seat us around 8pm on a Saturday within 15 minutes? There was going to be live music in the upstairs bar later so that might be worth checking out another time.\\n\\nOur waitress came over to walk us through the menu and tell us about the specials. Pro tip: bring a notebook and pen because the specials menu is about the same length as the regular menu. She rattled off at least another 10-12 dishes ranging from salads to appetizers to entrees. She really knew her stuff because she did not fumble over a single ingredient. We thought we knew what we wanted from the regular menu by the time we sat down (clams casino, two entrees) but upon hearing the specials we completely changed course (punny!) and ordered almost our entire meal from specials.\\n\\nWe started with (special) salads, which we never do, because the ingredients sounded lovely. My partner had something like an apricot and pecan salad and I ordered a spinach salad wrapped in prosciutto with feta or something. I actually wanted the beet salad but she told us about that one by accident or they were out by the time I ordered. My salad was truly a wrap and in my opinion it could have used half the amount of spinach, but both were overall delicious and full of flavors and textures despite being rabbit food.\\n\\nI lied, we actually started with the complimentary bread and what appeared to be a pesto dip. Nice way to cleanse the palate for sure!\\n\\nThen we ordered the (special) appetizer that consisted of two clams casino, two clams some-other-way, two giant prawn boys, and two stuffed poblano peppers. We figured why settle for just the clams casino when we could try a sampler? It was yummy but I wish we had just gone for the casino because the entire appetizer ended up being something like $40-50 by itself and we mostly enjoyed the clams anyway. We were both a little creeped out by the prawns haha.\\n\\nFor our meals! I ordered scallops (another special) because I will never turn down scallops, and my partner ordered the only thing from our meal that was off the main menu - the veal parmigiana. When he ordered, the waitress asked what kind of pasta he would like on the side as if it was included but as it turns out the side of pasta was another $12. I could make an entire pound of pasta and sauce from scratch to feed a family of 4 for $12! *Shock* My scallops were delicious. I didn\\'t like his veal but he enjoyed it. The pasta sauce was flavorful and yummy, always a good indicator for a solid Italian restaurant that doesn\\'t skimp on the staples.\\n\\nBy this time I had seen a neighbor table order dessert and there was a huge tray of desserts brought to them and I heard \"cheesecake\" so I decided to get wild and top off my meal with some dessert. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake. It was a perfectly textured/baked slice, but I didn\\'t get a lot of pumpkin flavoring, and I am all about that basic b* fall PSL life so I was, admittedly, a little disappointed. Did it stop me from eating the entire thing? No. \\n\\nThen our bill came. We had tried estimating it along the way and knew it would be over $100 but we didn\\'t expect it to be $195 (over $100 per person with tip)!\\n\\nI left feeling quite satisfied, check shock aside. Everything we ate was delicious, albeit a little pricier than we anticipated. If we come back here I think we will limit ourselves to our normal 2 courses each and we will at least be aware that the specials are also especially priced and not always commiserate with similar-sounding standard-menu counterparts. It would be swell if the restaurant could print the specials so we know the prices and so the servers don\\'t have to rattle them off for 20 minutes at the start of the meal. But, I had a similar experience at another Italian place (Giorgio on Pine) so I guess it\\'s just an ambience thing to shout an entire new menu to me as a patron when I sit down. I can get with it.\\n\\nBut seriously, #noregrets.

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED -

If I were to guess, I'd say it can only seat 30 people. Service was outstanding and very professional.\\n\\nAppetizer we ordered the grilled octopus with cold potato salad. 10/10 my mom wished she ordered this as her entree! Octopus was grilled to perfection, very tender and flavorful. The cold potato in the lemon sauce was a very nice touch. This was on the special and I highly recommend ordering it! \\n\\nMy mom ordered the Spaghetti alla scoglio. Very generous portion with seafood and the white wine sauce was light that it made eating this so easy. There was a tiny kick in this dish. 9/10. I ordered one of the specials, which was grilled swordfish w/calamari and shrimp, potato and zucchini. Extremely tender and fresh. Cooked perfectly and I have zero complaints. A lighter and healthier meal, and extremely filling 9/10\\n\\nThe star of the show was my dads entree, which was another special. He ordered the lamb osso bucco and wow *chefs kiss! The pasta was handmade and absolute perfection. Meat was tender and fell off the bone. The red sauce was not extremely strong, but also not weak. Had the perfect balance with a lot of flavor. This was 11/10 amazing! \\n\\nFor dessert, we all shared the tiramisu. This was the only dish that was just okay. Flavor was all there but the cream was frozen. We thought it was ice cream at first. I prefer my tiramisu soft and creamy rather than frozen. Still solid dessert.\\n\\nHighly recommend this restaurant and I will be back!\", 'date': '2021-11-17 18:13:34', 'user': {'name': 'Phylicia', 'review_count': 256, 'yelping_since': '2020-06-24 18:18:23', 'elite': '2021', 'average_stars': 4.62, 'fans': 10}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'W0XS8WNsR0s4Xnas3Bez7g', 'user_id': '7AQSshSLzV0VURxpM1gxpw', 'business_id': 'dYinIkKBspHV5hSaukklFg', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Had the pleasure of visiting L'Angolo this past week.

To start we had some appetizers to share: fresh mozzarella caprese, the spiedini, and the grilled shrimp and calamari. I really wished the portions of the appetizers were bigger, especially the grilled shrimp and calamari because it was just so freakin' good. But at L'Angola, you really don't have to worry about portion sizes, because they make sure you're fed, all right. For our entrees, a couple of us ordered the lamb ossobuco special, which was an enormous large shank with the bone still sticking out, with house made pasta on the bottom. Our group also had the shrimp and parppadelle special, the gnocchi, spaghetti scoglio, and the fish of the day which was a swordfish.  The servings were huge, and everything was authentic and delicious. By the end of dinner, everyone was so stuffed. But we still made room for dessert and shared two chocolate tortes, a cannoli, and tiramisu. My favorite was the chocolate torte but have to say the tiramisu was pretty good too.

We had the tasting menu, and there certainly were some highlights. We ordered the Stuzzichini with the prosciutto and coppa. This was very good, but I didn't care as much for the tigelle which came with it. These little pieces of fried bread had an unpleasant texture.\\n\\nThe Sweet Onion Crepe was the best thing I ate all evening. It had the purest distillation of amazing caramelized onion flavor that I have ever experience. I would order this again in a heartbeat. I also tried the Swordfish Braciole, which was delicious.\\n\\nThe Gnocchi was another highlight. The potato-less dumplings had the most beautiful texture, and the brown butter sauce lent the gnocchi a richness that was amazing. I was less pleased with the Spaghetti Alla Chitarra. Overall, I found that the sauce lacked flavor, and I would not reorder this pasta.\\n\\nMy husband and I split the Veal Milanese.

Service was exquisite, the ambiance was charming, and the food was incredible.\\n\\nService: From the phone call to confirm our reservation to wishing us goodbye as we left the service could not have been better. Our servers made wonderful recommendations, topped off our wine often, and brought us extra goodies throughout the evening. Note: Service is not fast, it is intentionally relaxed and spaced out so you can enjoy yourself. I never felt like we had to wait too long for any course, but if you haven't been to a restaurant like this before the paving might seem unfamiliar. \\n\\nAmbiance: The restaurant is on two levels of a row house. It's definitely not a large space, but they've made the most of it.  I didn't feel crowded at our table as there is plenty of space between tables so everyone has some privacy. But tables were close enough so we could see people's food as it was being brought out to their tables, which we enjoyed. Lighting was low, but not too low, the bathroom was exceptionally clean, the dishes and glasses all beautiful and charming. \\n\\nFood: They offer a structured menu from which you choose one option among many for each course. Every single thing I ordered was amazing! From the savory caramelized onion crepe with truffle, to the locally foraged mushroom ragu pasta, to the veal Milanese, to the pistachio cake with strawberry ice cream, every dish was exquisite. I\\n\\nAlso: We sprang for the wine pairings with each course and were really glad we did. Supposedly we were supposed to get a half a glass per course but it was definitely more like a whole glass each time! The wines were perfectly chosen for each dish and our servers were happy to tell us all about them. \\n\\nMy husband took me to the French Laundry for a milestone e birthday a few years ago when we lived in California, and I enjoyed Vetri Cucina more, and that's saying something. If I could give 6 stars, I would.

I am glad that Philly opened up indoor dining when they did. I was able to make the trip to take my gf for her birthday dinner. This is definitely a special occasion kind of establishment. So save your pennies and go to Vetri when you want to splurge. I truly believe that if Michelin gave stars in Philadelphia, Vetri would be one of the frontrunners. For me the entire experience, start to finish, was 5 stars. We showed up about ten minutes early for our reservation and were given two aperol spritz to enjoy while we wait. We were called in shortly thereafter to be seated. \\n\\nAs we walked up the stairs to our table in the upstairs dining room we were greeted by any staff we encountered on the way. While this is without a doubt fine dining, there is no pretentiousness lingering in the air. You feel as though you are being welcomed into someones home. Our waiter, Bobby, just made sure the entire experience was well rounded. He was very welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive. Everything from ambiance, staff, music, etc, set the tone for an incredible dining experience. \\n\\nNow on to the good stuff (the food). I won't cover every single dish specifically, but I will touch upon my personal standouts, as I couldn't pick a definitive #1 (that's a good problem). The prosciutto and the maple smoked duck breast were the perfect way to get the jowls salivating lol. The sweetbreads dish was bomb. They still managed to hold on to a little of the crispiness while covered in that delicious cream sauce.  The pappardelle with rabbit bolognese is an unassuming dish that packs a very well balanced flavor explosion. The stuffed guinea hen (prosciutto and foie gras) was another amazing dish. We also had tenderloin tartare, lobster tagliolini, and eggplant Milanese. We opted for the wine pairing and it was definitely worth it. Every wine was great and paired well with each dish. Even the dessert wines (which I am not normally a fan of) were great!  For desserts we had the molten peanut butter cake with Concorde grape gelato and the coconut semifreddo. The play on peanut butter and jelly was great. It's what you wish every peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever ate tasted like. The sorbet that accompanies the semifreddo is the perfect refreshing palette cleanser to end the meal. Great meal (from the amuse bouche to the petit fours), great experience.

I've been meaning to give it a whirl for years, but life has blocked me out last-minute each time I've scheduled a reservation. And, ironically enough, the wake of the pandemic was finally my time. Indoor dining mid-COVID is a new challenge for restaurants and restaurant-goers, alike. Fortunately, Vetri did a phenomenal job of ensuring social distancing throughout our visit -- most notably, were separated from other tables by both plenty of room and by physical dividers.\\n\\nWalking up the stairs to Vetri's dining room felt like being welcomed into an old-school Italian home. A center island and espresso machine are on full display in the space, and the lime-green walls are highlighted by Victorian guardrails and wooden accents. The semblance of traditionality is sharply contrasted by a deep red blown-glass chandelier, while 50s music plays unobtrusively in the background.\\n\\nWe were welcomed with a complementary spritz, a summer crowd-pleaser with an orange liquor base and a slice of fresh fruit. As we browsed the menu, our server eagerly highlighted some of her favorites. We opted for the Beef Tenderloin Tartare, the Sweet Onion Crepe, the Swiss Chard Gnocchi, the Corn Anolini the Dry Aged Pork Loin, the Roasted Baby Goat (a $35 upcharge), the Chocolate Polenta Souffle, and the Panna Cotta with Poached Peaches and Raspberry Granita.\\n\\nTo kick off our meal, we were ushered a bowl of focaccia and whole-grain sourdough. The airy center of our bread was contrasted by a delicately charred crust, complemented by a salty butter. We then were offered an amouse-bouche: cucumber-zucchini gazpacho with a tempura squash blossom. Each bite tasted like summer, transporting me to childhood afternoons rolling down grassy hills.\\n\\nOn to our antipasti, the tartare sported a blast of acidity from the red onion and capers. Admittedly, I would have preferred the crisp of traditional toasts over the somewhat doughy gnocchi friti, but the dyanmic flavors were a strong win. Meanwhile, the crepe was magical--the condensed onions almost had a jam-like consistency and the smokiness of an open fire, bound by a rich pasty and truffle cream sauce. By transforming the essense of onion into something brand new, it's no wonder that this is one of the Vetri's classics after 2 decades.\\n\\nTo the pasta course, the gnocchi themselves were heavenly pillows, with a richness of butter and ricotta that gave way to the delicate flavor of the chard. Meanwhile, the anolini highlighted the sweetness of summer corn, echoing the sweetness and happiness of the best corncake of my childhood. This was doubled by the zing of salt from Osetra caviar. \\n\\nFor the entrees, the goat was the fancy rendition of a holiday roast: the polenta itself could stand its own, and the meat. (especially the crispy skin) was loaded with flavor from spices and flame alike. This was arguably the best dish I've had the pleasure to enjoy this year (and well worth the $35 supplement). On our other plate, the espresso reduction and the duo of honey nut squash were the standouts, adding a desserty dimension to an otherwise standard slice of meat.\\n\\nFinally to dessert, the souffle was masterfully cooked, the dynamic dark chocolate finding the ideal balance between dense and gooey, and complemented by a vanilla gelato and cocoa nibs. In contrast, the zing of the summertime fruits brought the lightness of the last days of summer to the panna cotta. Lastly, we were offered 2 flavorful final bites: a fruit-creme truffle and an almond cookie.\\n\\nAt $110 for the COVID 4-course tasting menu (a relative steal compared to the $165pp just a few months ago), Vetri undoubtedly is a meal fit for a special occasion. But just the goat alone is reason enough to splurge on the experience. While I wondered if I would be missing out on the full Vetri experience, I nonetheless and left feeling contently full (rather than overwhelmingly so). Most importantly, Vetri left me with a memorable experience, both in exciting new memories and in ones I haven't recalled in years.\", 'date': '2020-09-13 22:43:44', 'user': {'name': 'Austin', 'review_count': 211, 'yelping_since': '2016-12-30 22:23:33', 'elite': '2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.08, 'fans': 25}}\n[R37] {'review_id': 'Lg0gnSeoqz94MWYiOsdv8w', 'user_id': 'IO0mnEw_c1FeJkQvg5t5eg', 'business_id': 'wUnLSg_GKfEIQ5CQQ770_g', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'I am a nurse at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and I want to give Vetri a BIG THANKS for sending over multiple free and scrumptious meals to our staff!

Sandwiched in between the layers was a fruit marmalade. It was heavenly. Our next courses were bison tartare with black caviar and potato dumplings and hamachi crudo. I thought the foie gras was great. The tartare was orgasmic! Crazy good. I had to control my emotions. Our next courses were a prosciutto cotto and a vidalia onion tart. I had hunted a hog last year and had my fill of pork products for a long while. The prosciutto reignited my love for pork products. Such exquisite flavor with the nuts and peppers!

However, this review is really 4.75 stars because one of our dishes was less than satisfactory which I will explain later.\\n\\nIt's a small spot with only 30 something seats. My husband and I were seated in one of the front windows which was a great table. Our service was excellent from start to finish- we were a little early to our reservation and the hostess gave us a complimentary aperol spritz to sip on while we waited. Eric was our server for the night and he was excellent- well versed on each dish and very attentive.\\n\\nI love a good tasting menu and the best part about Vetri's is that they give you the option to 'yes' or 'no' certain items- they let you see the menu and if there is something you MUST have or, on the contrary, something you do NOT want, you can let them know ahead of time. The other huge plus about Vetri's tasting is that not everyone at your table gets the same set of courses! That means that I, since I dined with my husband, was able to taste even more courses than I would have if we had all the same dishes. Here is a quick rundown for anyone visiting Vetri in the near future:\\n1. starters included mozarella, the most delicious fennel crusted with parm, and an amazing pastrami foie gras. \\n2. next up was the hamachi crudo and the bison tartare. Between the two, the bison was the outstanding dish and I could have kept eating it all night. The hamachi was great but the fish + citrus combo is not my favorite so I much preferred the tartare. \\n3. the sweet onion crepe, diver scallops and prosciutto cotto were next, all of which were absolutely divine. However, the prosciutto was the clear winner to me and may have been my favorite dish of the entire night. \\n4. next up was our first of two pasta courses. I loved that the first round was a small sampling of three of their dishes so as not to overwhelm or stuff you with pasta. We had two plump spinach gnocchis, two almond tortellinis with truffle sauce (this was one of my must-haves), and two ricotta raviolis. These three were equally stunning dishes.\\n5. the second round of pasta were slightly larger servings, enough for a few bites each. We had the tajarin with mushrooms and the busiate with pork shank ragu. Of these two, I preferred the tajarin (i love a pasta with mushrooms) over the busiate, which I found to be a little bland and lacking in the vibrant flavors all of the preceding dishes had. Overall, however, I definitely preferred the first round of pasta dishes over the second.\\n6. the next course was our 'secondi' which I had not paid much mind to when looking over the menu at the start of the meal so I had not given a preference. My husband received the capretto with polenta which was lightyears ahead of my dish although not my favorite of the night. I received the bollito misto which is my reason for the 0.25 star deduction... this dish was so underwhelming and disappointing I was left a little shocked that the same kitchen could turn out all the dishes mentioned above and this one. To be fair, I do not care for stews or crockpot dishes because, to me, the flavors all blend together into one taste which I hate. This is what the bollito misto tasted like since it is literally just meat and vegetables boiled together. I understand that this is probably a very traditional italian dish but there was nothing about this dish I liked. Even the accompaniments did not seem to go with the rest of the dish (the salsa verde, although good on its own, seemed especially out of place). \\n7. Thankfully, dessert picked right back up where we left off at the pasta and all three dishes were fabulous. The lime posset was definitely the underdog here but still good. The hazelnut praline semifreddo and the pistachio flan were BEYOND... and I don't even know how to describe them so just trust me when I say you need to try these.\\n\\nOk, so now we get to the price. Yes, it's a pricey tasting menu but for $330, the cost of two people, we got to try 15 dishes, not including the starters, the vast majority of which were what I call 'mind-blowing' dishes (aka I cannot make this at home and I have NO idea how they made it taste so good). Vetri is a very high caliber restaurant and it is obvious why they have been around for over 20 years now. I like to think my very disappointing entree was a one-off since almost everything else was outstanding.

When we arrived, our table wasn\\'t ready, but they escorted us upstairs to a waiting area and offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco. At first, this was appreciated as a nice gesture. Unfortunately, we ended up having to wait at least a full 55 (!!) minutes past our reservation time before we were even seated. (Honestly, I believe it was actually even longer than that.) There were AT LEAST four other groups also waiting for at least 40 minutes or more throughout our entire wait as well.  Finally, after 40-45 minutes of waiting, we politely asked about the status and whether we could be seated soon and were told our \"table was being set now.\" It still took another 10-15 minutes (at least) to be seated. The staff apologized and one female hostess said they \"make up for it.\" Unfortunately, I wish we would have left instead of continuing to wait. \\n\\nI presumed they would comp at least something or a portion of our bill, but that unfortunately did not occur. I do appreciate that, after we were finally seated, the staff seemed to expedite our food. However, waiting that long last a reservation time is unreasonable for two very busy working professsionals.  Given that this is supposed to be a fine dining experience, I also expected more effort to make up for this long delay on their part.  As a result, I would not return- at least not on a week night - and would not recommend others dine here without an early reservation and plenty of time to wait.  Their food is very good, but I believe there are very comparable italian restaurants in Philly (for a more affordable cost as well) and others would not require waiting close to an hour, or more, past a reservation time.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the restaurant\\'s decision to move all of the waiting parties upstairs and out of sight of the dining tables means that current diners do not see the several parties upstairs to be seated and thus feel no need to leave the table once they have finished dining. There were numerous groups lingering and oblivious to the many who were waiting.

The wait staff was superb, from the beginning to the end of the service, though I have to say service did start out slow - it took a while for us to get seated even though we had a reservation. And we didn't get menus for 15 minutes after we were seated. It definitely got better and picked up as the courses started flowing. Our server started us off with some predinner bites, which were pretty good. The standout was the foie gras on toast. As part of the predinner bites, we were also served local raw vegetables consisting of sliced carrots, radishes, etc, with a side of oddly looking balsamic jelly, which seemed inconsistent with the tasting menu and did not taste good. Other than that, everything was great. Our server was very friendly and went over the tasting menu with us. The tasting menu consists of 4 courses, with about 4-6 items under each course. Not all of the 21 food items would be served. Instead, our server explained that the menu should be treated as more of a guide, and the chefs would tailor the tasting experience to each table based on each guest's food preferences. The chefs sent out different dishes from each course for my husband and I so that we could taste as many different dishes on the menu. Of the 21 items, we had 14 of them, which was plenty. We shared and enjoyed everything, especially the pastas. They were definitely the BEST that I've ever had. Some favorites of the night were:\\n- Bay scallops with caviar (Antipasti)\\n- Sweetbread saltimbocca (Antipasti)\\n- Prosciutto with brown butter, pepper and nuts (Antipasti ) \\n- Cauliflower scapinocc (Pasta)\\n- Busiate with pork shank ragu (Pasta)\\n- Duck with chicories + 'nduja (Secondi)\\n- Chocolate polenta souffl\u00e9 (Dolce)\\nAlso, we probably got three different bread baskets throughout dinner. They were all very well made. The focaccia bread was the best though. It was super soft and spongey. After dessert, our server brought over post dinner treats including profiteroles, cake bites and chocolate! Yum! As we finished up and got ready to leave, our server gave us to take home our own Vetri menu and some chocolate caramel pretzel bark. A very nice touch.

I decided to gifted my husband with a dinner here for his birthday because I knows he is a fan of chef Marc Vetri. The real purpose was meeting him and I clearly requested it several times to make sure that the night we had dinner the chef would be there and that he would have stopped at the table. Whoever was on the phone, guaranteed that chef would have been there. We had dinner last night and the first disappointment was that after we got sit, we asked about chef Vetri and he wasn\\'t there. We felt fooled because we could have rescheduled the dinner if only they mentioned it during the phone call that I recieved the day before to confirm the reservation. That changed my mood even my hysband told me that we can just have dinner, we would have had other occasions to meet him. Bad idea.\\nThe dinner was a huge disappointment. \\nWe started with they\\'re tasting men\u00f9. \\nThe madai crudo was underseasoned, completely flat like most of the dishes we were served that I will describe right now. I couldn\\'t tell if the prosciutto cotto was just the better quality of an american ham or just didn\\'t taste right because it was sliced too thick. It was very balanced tho, the flavours were ok. We had scallops, saltimbocca and the sweet onion cr\u00e9pe. Last one had a very good and intense onion flavor but was overpowering all the other ingredients, not very balanced. Overall appetizers were ok but there was no wow factor.\\nProblems started with the pasta dishes. Probably my husband is very picky in terms of fresh pasta because in Italy he had a family business wich fresh pasta was the main thing.\\nHe had the gnocchi. I would have called them \"gnudi\" (naked in italian. basically the classic ricotta and spinach raviolo stuffing without the pasta, typical of the Toscana region). That because the texture was very soft; gnocchi usually ar more hard and firm. But that is just an opinion. They were seasoned beautifully, very tasty with a nice topping of ricotta salata. They  were ruined by the puddle of completely unseasoned and broken brown butter they were submerged into, giving me a nasty greasy sensation on my lips. \\nWe had other two stuffed pastas wich were crafted beautifully but were completely flat and underseasoned and leaving an unpleasant aftertaste of burned butter. In Italy we definetly don\\'t eat all this butter.\\nThan he had the tagliolini with mushrooms. That for him was the only good dish wich truly impressed him. Pasta was pure perfection, slightly undercooked (he comes from Abruzzo and he eats pasta like that) and even if he\\'s not a big fan of mushrooms, he tought they were beautifully seasoned. A very simple dish but with a big impact. Too bad the only one.\\nThe worse was the second course. \\nHe had capretto. Quality of meat was high but it was very simplistic. Not bad but still no wow factor.\\nI had the worse. I was served dry aged pork. We couldn\\'t tell if it was raw, so he tried it and probably it was because it was inedible and impossible to bite, very gamey and hard. But the worst surprise when he tasted it was that the sauce was completely burned. This dish was really terrible, offensive for the price I paid and probably the worst I ever had in my life. We were forced to send it back. They substituted it with the duck. It was slightly under, skin wasn\\'t crispy but soggy and the taste of blood was too intense. The dish came out really quickly so probably that was the reason. Sauce tasted like plain vinegar, it was very acidic. I felt unconfortable to also send it back so luckily it was paired with good nduja and i chugged it trying to cover up the awful taste. Very bad.\\nTime for dessert.\\nI was served a pistacchio flan wich didn\\'t taste like pistacchio at all. Very flat. They gave us other two chocolate based desserts that tasted like nothing. We left them all, very disappointing.\\nI wonder if they even taste the food before sending it out because almost everything was flat and underseasoned.\\nI want to believe that the kitchen was in a very bad day, hope that is not the standard and I hope chef Vetri knows about that when he is absent.\\nThe only reason I\\'m giving the one star it\\'s because of the service. The dining assistant that we had was really professionals and attentive. He gave us a great service and he was always on point about our request. He brought us a taste of ana amzing wine to pair it worh the duck to apologize about the pprk dishes. I wish the wine list would be more clear, I wouldn\\'t order a $35 wine by glasse but it worth it. \\nOverall, I\\'m disappointed about that experience and mostly about the fact that I was so sure that the chef would stop by to our table so my husband could finally meet him.', 'date': '2019-12-18 03:54:45', 'user': {'name': 'Giovanna', 'review_count': 3, 'yelping_since': '2016-09-16 13:06:31', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 2.33, 'fans': 0}}\n[R50] {'review_id': 'Bcmlr3g9P1hT7ih2g2GXAw', 'user_id': '8R16InoIf-JheYnh9EOR7w', 'business_id': 'wUnLSg_GKfEIQ5CQQ770_g', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 3, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 4, 'text': 'It\\'s impossible not to give Vetri five stars. Any argument I can come up with is half-baked and flimsy. This is a five-star experience from start to finish. Your night will be perfectly choreographed and it will feel like an art as much as a science. The service is impeccable, the food is outstanding and somehow it\\'s been shimmying out with this excellence for years and years and years. It would be easy for a place like Vetri to become tired and caught caught flatfooted after so much time in the world, but it continues to dazzle and impress, even amidst the hype. Expect to be full as can be at the end of your dinner here. And expect to be treated like royalty -- even if you\\'re the ultimate difficult patron, as I am. I\\'m seriously impressed -- hence the hyperbole oozing out of this intro. This is where to book your special occasion dinner. Old school vibes and modern technique come together at Vetri for a masterful performance, and you\\'ll get a personalized menu at the end of the meal to remember it for all of eternity. \\n\\nCame here as a party of five on a Friday night at 9pm. It\\'s an intimate space -- quite small, in a homey way. The vibes here will assure you that you\\'ll be taken care of in a thoughtful, genuine way. Somehow upscale and cozy at the same time, you\\'ll find dim lighting, antique fixtures and aromas for days. You 100% need to make a reservation -- the space is as small as it is popular. When you reserve, they\\'ll ask about specific dietary preferences/restrictions, which they will confirm when you arrive. Very thorough.\\n\\nUpon sitting down, you will be greeted with a welcome cocktail (but do *not* forget your ID -- Pennsylvania liquor laws are far more stringent than most, and a few of us weren\\'t thinking about it and didn\\'t bring out wallets which stirred up some frustration but ultimately it all worked out...story for another day), a sparkling vermouth-based drink (wine/beer only here). There\\'s a fabulous wine selection here, which I urge you to take advantage of is you can. That said, I actually would advise against the wine pairing -- while it seems obvious to opt for it at a place like this, it was a little much for me. By the end, I really didn\\'t want it anymore, which was a shame. At the same time, the wine pairing could be worth it just for the sommelier. The gentleman who was helping us had comically extensive knowledge of each wine, which he shared in an animated and painstakingly thorough way. I don\\'t think I retained any of the knowledge he was dropping, but the theatrics of it are hard to beat. \\n\\nThe most unique thing about Vetri is the way that they structure their tasting menu. I\\'m not sure if I\\'m a fan of it or not. It\\'s not better or worse than what I\\'m used to, it\\'s just different. Unlike all other tasting menus I\\'ve had to date, Vetri curates a unique menu for each party member as opposed to bringing everyone the same set list of dishes. Meaning all five of us has slightly different meals. For example: I have a gluten sensitivity and Vetri serves two pasta dishes as part of its menu, so they gave me the option of doing one pasta dish, one alternate (they ended up bringing me a mushroom dish that was bonkers good). My sister doesn\\'t eat duck while I love it, so I got a juicy duck breast for my entree-type dish while she got steak. Little things like that. They will personalize as best as they can. \\n\\nI tend to find it onerous to detail each dish in a tasting menu, so I\\'ll just give highlights and overall impressions. Start to finish, everything was delicious and well-paced. From the first array of bites in the beginning, we knew we were in for something special. The cheese was fluffy and perfect, the roasted cauliflower seasoned perfectly and super satisfying. \\n\\nOther highlights:\\n-The onion tart. This is a staple here and for good reason. Impossibly rich and flavorful\\n-The spinach gnocchi and almond tortellini were outstanding. I\\'m very sensitive to gluten so I didn\\'t finish this part of the dinner, but my god, it was worth trying. I\\'ve never liked gnocchi -- even great gnocchi, usually I just don\\'t jive with the consistency -- but this was special. \\n-The prosciutto served family-style during the appetizer portion. They said its magic was simply due to being \"doused in oil and pickle juice\" but it must have been more than that. Like everything else, just incredibly flavorful and delicious\\n-The octopus was cooked perfectly, paired with pork belly which was a treat. I\\'ve often seen octopus paired with chorizo, so this was some extra special luxury. \\n\\nThey will bringing you lots and lots and lots of bread (and it\\'s already a pretty heavy tasting menu) so do yourselves a favor and save it to take home. Have a little here and there but it\\'s just as good the next day, and it will allow you to experience the meal without having your buttons pop open.', 'date': '2019-12-09 15:38:24', 'user': {'name': 'Molly', 'review_count': 544, 'yelping_since': '2015-02-08 03:12:59', 'elite': '2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.16, 'fans': 212}}\n\n## TASK\n\n**You MUST calculate ALL values listed below**.

After checking out the RW menu online, and comparing it to a few others that I thought were worth checking out, friends and I decided that Alice Pizza was the spot for us. Two out of three of us had been for pizza and gelato before, but this was a first for the sit down, full menu dining experience. We called about a week in advance to make our reservation and were easily able to get the time we wanted.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately upon arrival and our vaccination cards were checked per the city mandate. We were offered regular and RW menus. As a participant in dry January, I only peeked at the drink menu to avoid temptation. I was pleased to see that the drink prices are pretty reasonable and there's a wide selection of cocktails, beer, and wine. I opted for a diet coke with lemon, another friend participating had a blood orange italian soda, and our non-dry January friend had an espresso martini.\\n\\nThe four course RW menu had 4 different choices for first course and the second course, so we all agreed upon our three preferences from each category and ordered accordingly. We each did our own thing for course 3, and then shared desserts for the fourth and final course.\\n\\nTo start, we had the Mozzarella Tasting, Salumi e Formagi Misti, and Burrata Con Tartufo. The servings were small, but just enough so that we could each have a bite of everything. For our second course, we had the Cacio e Pepe Gnocchi Fritti, Suppli al Telefono, and Sformato. Again, these dishes were on the smaller side, but perfect to share. The gnocchi was incredible, the ragu with the suppli was perfect, and the sformato was next level - definitely my favorite.\\n\\nFor my third course, I had the Carbonara pizza. This was the main event dish, the portion was so big I could hardly finish half. So crisp, well topped, minimal crust and just delicious. My mouth is watering while writing this review and thinking about that pizza. \\n\\nTo wrap up the evening, we had the Sfogliatelle, Tortina Della Nonna, and Crema Catalana. Honestly, I think we were served a key lime pie instead of the Tortina Della Nonna because there was a lime garnish and no nut toppings but I am so glad because that little pie was my favorite dessert.\\n\\nStart to finish, a delightful night. Our server Dom was personable, attentive, and made the evening thoroughly enjoyable. I can't wait to return to Alice for another sit down meal to try all of the other menu options.

Simply fantastic pizza, certainly one of the better pizzas I've had. I went with 2 friends and we ordered 2 pizzas to share between the 3 of us, a Margherita and a Philly Special. The Margherita was as good as they get; the sauce was not too salty or sweet, the basil was fresh, and the cheese was tasty without being overly greasy. The Philly Special was terrific. I was very impressed by the pesto and how fresh and flavorful it was which is not easy to do. The crusts were excellent too, a perfect combination of crispy on the bottom and slightly chewy on the top without being either soggy or burnt.\\n\\nOverall highly recommend going here with a group and sharing several pizzas, they are a bit large for one person to eat in one sitting although a piece would no doubt be fine for reheating. The service is solid and there's outdoor seating too for the COVID-conscious. They also have a huge selection of drinks and gelato which looked really good.

Originally developed in Rome, Alice Pizza has expanded worldwide and is now a heavy-hitter in the pizza al taglio game. A friend remarked that this spot was a regular spot in her culinary routine during her semester abroad in Rome, so it\\'s about time that I tried the Center City outpost.\\n\\nThe decor is confusingly over-the-top and in slight disrepair. Funky wire lighting fixtures hang from the high ceilings, and the walls prominently display murals and paintings depicting scenes from Rome. The large space is dominated by a U-shaped center counter. A rainbow of gelato options highlights the front side, with a long row of assorted square pies along the left and a full-service bar on the right. Mismatched chairs are paired with Mod Podge-esque tables. Contemporary rock blends with the buzz from the kitchen.\\n\\nMy partner and I decided to split a few slices during our visit this past weekend. Ordering in-person was a breeze, and the slices were reheated within 5 minutes.\\n\\nThe crust itself was pleasantly light and crisp. Each slice had a generous helping of clearly premium toppings. I loved that sauce and toppings spread very nearly to the edges of the crust. Our favorites flavors were the Diavolo (spicy salami), Philly Special (pesto, arugula, and sundried tomatoes), and Salsiccia e Funghi (sausage and mushrooms). The only flavor that was a letdown for us was the Melenzane Picante (eggplant), which was lukewarm, slightly slimy, and overly oily, and one-dimensional.\\n\\nOur eyes were definitely larger than our stomachs -- we ended up getting 6 rectangular slices (translating into 12 square-sized ones). I would recommend 2-3 rectangular slices per person for a solid meal. Nonetheless, the $30 (after tax and tip) for our meal was still a bit jarring for pizza.

I have not even had pizza like this in NYC or Boston (which I have always found weird because of the storied Italian influence in these cities). My review is only 3-stars for the following reasons - the Caprese \"heirloom tomatoes\" were not even close to meeting my expectations and they put too much sea salt on but not enough EVOO or oregano. Remember mozzarella is already a salty cheese so overdoing the added sea salt was just too much. Lastly, I ordered the added Prosciutto to the caprese and paid an up charge of $5.50 for it, but it wasn\\'t added to the dish. VERY disappointing. Because I obtained this meal as take-away I didn\\'t notice until I had arrived back at the hotel. For the charge, this is totally unsatisfactory. In hind-sight the added saltiness of the meat would have been completely overwhelming in light of my comment about the excessive sea salt. Finally, when I called in to order my food, the server didn\\'t understand the menu and I had to educate her that, yes in fact they do have a caprese on the menu. How can someone working in a restaurant not know the menu? Really?\\nIn summary, the pizza was awesome, the caprese was not worth it in the end. This would be an awesome spot for a walk-in and walk-away lunch - get your pizza, fold it in half and indulge as you walk down the streets of Philadelphia and for a minute believe you are in the streets of Roma.', 'date': '2021-08-13 09:22:55', 'user': {'name': 'Eric', 'review_count': 80, 'yelping_since': '2016-12-21 07:57:37', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.81, 'fans': 0}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'EhU8pUGM3FNPKFO2xxETSQ', 'user_id': 'Oumcr7bl4Jg8WVlkWb9y-g', 'business_id': 'VSDdUwXktnvL_O0meKv7MQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'The pizza was amazing!

We were told by the host that we would be seated outside since the owner was celebrating the grand opening with his guests inside. We weren't bothered since the weather was nice and they had patio heaters, it was a nice ambiance. We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and Philly Cheesesteak calzones however, only the pizza was good. The food overall  was underwhelming. My husband also ordered a Lofi sour, which was too sour to drink. He had originally asked for a mojito, but they only had the 5 drinks available on the menu.

I didn\\'t even eat any of the Italian Wedding Soup I ordered as I was just stuffed.\\n\\nMy coworker and I came here after the new grand \"reopening.\" LaScala\\'s Fire has been open about a week and used to just be LaScala\\'s. In these COVID-19 times, we were upset when they closed thinking it was for good. Thank God it wasn\\'t!\\n\\nLaScala\\'s Fire has a very easy to use online ordering website and I used it without any difficulties to place a pick-up order. I love how with certain items they move into sub-menus for extra add-ons or take-aways. The price adjusts accordingly for the add-ons. After placing your order, they give you a time it should be ready and it was!\\n\\nThe Alicia\\'s salad was nothing much in way of the salad itself. Greens, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, but I added some calamari which upped the game, and the dressing they kept to the side. However, the gigantic sphere of a meatball with a huge amount of ricotta and red sauce was almost a meal in itself. Perfectly cooked with an almost crispy outer rim, juicy inside and so much flavor. Mixed with the ricotta was perfect. I was not the biggest fan of the red sauce, but everyone has their preferences. \\n\\nThe fried calamari came back to work a little on the soggy side, and they were too salty for me. Next time I\\'ll try at the restaurant itself and I bet they\\'ll be better. Most of that came home for someone else in the family to enjoy.\\n\\nLastly, dessert was so decadent. The zeppoles were perfectly fried dough balls in powdered sugar with an outstanding cannoli cream over them. Then, to somehow make them even better, a raspberry dipping sauce. OMG. \\n\\nMy coworker really liked her chicken Caesar salad that she added bacon to. Couldn\\'t finish it but did chow down on the nice grilled chicken. Had to save room for the zeppoles! \\n\\nLaScala\\'s Fire also looked awesome inside in gleaming white and has plenty of seating. The staff were using all COVID-19 precautions. We inquired about a luncheon and they said they are taking things day by day as the rules seem to change by the second in Philadelphia. However, they can accommodate.\\n\\nThe online ordering menu allows for a tip to be added, and you pay with credit. $67 for everything including tax and tip - 2 salads, soup, calamari, and zeppoles! I\\'ll definitely be back to try the pizzas, paninis, Stromboli, calzone, some other starters, and their favorites.

At one time, it was a go-to restaurant for me. The atmosphere, food, and service was great. Now, I'm giving 1 star for service, and 1 star for the apps. What's good... the service. Our waiter was Kenardi, and LaScala's is lucky to have him. He's the only reason the experience didn't end up being a disaster. He's very attentive and friendly. The food... The bread and oil dip is excellent. The appetizers we had was pretty good (White Pear Pizza, especially ) and Im glad because we sent back 2 entrees. Both were chicken pasta dishes. The chicken was literally boiled in water and thrown on top of noodles, it was absolutely flavorless, the sauce was just as bad... it was like eating cardboard topped with chalk. Both dishes were really terrible. I couldn't even dress it up. Use the seasoning rack, dammit! The atmosphere is confusing. They have candles lit on all the tables, but what mood is that setting when your customers under lights bright enough for a broadway show. Also, they don't pay attention to seating. The restaurant was pretty empty, so sitting adult parties next a table with 3 screaming kids wasn't very thoughtful. I think it's unfortunate the way LaScala's has changed. It's not hard to get it right, you just have to pay attention, and put the effort in. Prior to this visit, it has been a long time. I'm not gonna say I'll never go back, because I'm really hoping this was just a bad night, and I can still count on one of my old favorite restaurants.

Their portions were huge mine was a little smaller but that was fine with me cuz i was full from the apps.\\nDessert: My cousin and I split the chocolate fudge cake. It was so Good!\\nBeverages: Red wine Sangria was tasty. My aunt and mom had an after dinner espresso martini and said it was the best one they ever had.\\nWill definitely be back', 'date': '2018-12-25 14:53:54', 'user': {'name': 'Erin', 'review_count': 20, 'yelping_since': '2018-04-21 13:49:48', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 4.6, 'fans': 1}}\n[R47] {'review_id': 'ZDX_jACBf9b8Lnoc-kuQBQ', 'user_id': '6jqe0ElKpdYGSDkc45JkVA', 'business_id': 'RZtGWDLCAtuipwaZ-UfjmQ', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Seemed to have the worst service in the restaurant.

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED -

It was then, looking around at the sea of White faces who all stopped eating to stare at us, that we realized why we had that awkward experience down the street - they didn't want to serve us because we were Black. It was weird to experience such ugly and open racism right on Broad Street, but here we are, part of a long lineage of Black folks getting denied dinners at restaurants throughout the decades.

Just be sure not to eat the leaves like I did!  The eggplant tower had breaded eggplant, fresh mozzarella, and Jersey tomatoes. The salad had a variety of lettuces, olives, onions with a balsamic dressing. I would prefer dressing in the side as it was a little too drenched for me. The corn and crab soup was sooo good! It had fresh Jersey corn in a light broth with chunks of bran. It was nicely spiced.\\nOn to the entrees! Portions are large. Most of my party needed to go bags. My spaghetti and clams was tasty with chopped clams, chopped tomatoes and clams in the shell. A little too much garlic but it is an Italian restaurant.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and tender.

Kind of similar to Ristorante Pesto in terms of cuisine type and about equally good; kind of a dying breed of restaurant in Philly.

We didn\\'t have a reservation, but thought we would just walk there and see if we could eat. The hostess gave us in our opinion the best seat in the house, a little table right next to the open window wall. She told us we needed to be done in 45 minutes because that\\'s when the next reservation for that table began. We tend to eat fast, so that was no problem for us! This place is very small and cozy, with dim lighting. It\\'s a nice date spot! Our waitress was great to begin with, but forgot about us after our food was brought out. We decided to order 2 pizzas and share them. My husband ordered the spicy sausage and had the caramelized onions omitted on his half. I ordered the spicy soppressata and he asked for the honey to be omitted on his half. I appreciate them allowing you to make small alterations, and not pulling the \"chef created this to perfection\" card. Each pizza was $17, which seems about right for the quality and charm of the place! Our pizza was brought out in under 10 minutes! A food runner brought the pizza, not our waitress and we were out of water and it was clear after 6-7 minutes she wasn\\'t coming back anytime soon, so we had to ask another waitress for a water refill. She must have told our waitress because she cane back with water and apologized. After she apologized, we were fine, didn\\'t hold a grudge. Our pizza was so delicious! The pepperoni was so crispy and paired perfectly with the honey! My husband\\'s sausage pizza was also very good! I felt like it was missing acidic and textural elements though. It needed a little lemon or vinegar and something on top for a little crunch. But overall, very excellent! We finished in about 35 minutes and we\\'re just waiting for our waitress to come back so we could ask for a box and the check. She finally came back after another 7 minutes. We were getting nervous because we didn\\'t want to screw over the hostess who let us take the table. When she brought the bill we had our card out and ready for her to take. By the time she brought it back, we had gone over the 45 minutes. There aren\\'t very many tables, this place is very small and they seemed to have a handful of waitress/waiters in addition to food runners, so we\\'re not sure what caused our waitress to be aloof after we ordered.

At the same time, my marinara pizza had fabulous basil flavor from the fresh basil leaves. Sometimes, it's worth just going with the Trenton Pie on the happy hour menu. Simple, and totally delicious. After many visits, I've developed some favorites on the menu. Specials are often worth checking out, including the Bistro Salad, which I order regularly. Always good. Recently, we tried the Cacio e pepe, which was good, although the cheese sauce on it was a bit in the direction of a more traditional mac 'n' cheese - just mentioning that in case you're looking for a more authentic Italian version. Still, quite satisfying.\\n\\nAnd I haven't even mentioned the friendly staff. Apparently only really nice people are allowed to work here. After many visits, I'm still a fan.

This small Italian restaurant is snuggled in between two businesses. They offer both indoor and outdoor dining.  They are very prompt with seating their guess who either has reservations or who doesn't have reservations. Once I got here I was seated properly by my server Connor. Connor was very knowledgeable of all the wines that were offered as well as the full menu. He introduced the special for the week which was the seven fishes special which was a three-course meal that introduced seven fish dishes. I was totally intrigued and I took him up on his offer. The feast is an annual 6 day long special menu (regular menu available as well). I ordered the red wine that was simply amazing. It was very smooth yet tight towards the end. The bathrooms are really clean, and they are well decorated with priceless pieces of art. The feast of the seven fishes consisted of the olive & smoke salmon crostone, the fried cod, the grilled octopus, the shrimp scampi with the baccala mash were all incredible. The code shrimp salad was simply amazing. While the grilled octopus was cooked to perfection. If you ever find yourself in Center City wanting some authentic Italian cuisine please check out little Nonnas and please tell them that SHIMMY sent you and ask for my good friend Connor!\", 'date': '2022-01-16 13:51:42', 'user': {'name': 'Julian', 'review_count': 103, 'yelping_since': '2014-10-14 04:39:04', 'elite': '2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.25, 'fans': 10}}\n[R2] {'review_id': '85vyHA52vBCxb5fTlNqDbg', 'user_id': 'I_dOZb3ZCLfSfV3lbFhu0g', 'business_id': 'lKU_kljhbEQKIPaM1Zbqiw', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'text': 'Food was amazing, the Courtyard is where to sit for the perfect ambiance.

Got the escarole and apple salad, wild mushroom arancini, and the Sunday gravy. Portion sizes were very generous, especially the Sunday gravy. The braided beef short rib in the Sunday gravy was so tender the meat basically fell apart without really having to chew it.

It does have a parking lot but spaces are very limited due to being small. We can agree is still better than paid or meter parking. \\n\\nMondo Dei Dolci\\'s pastries changes daily. So if you ever favor a cake, call to ask before going as they might not have specific ones on the menu that day. So far, we try opera, red velvet, tiramisu, macarons, cookies and cream, bird milk soufle, carrot cake, triton etc.... Our favorite is Cookies and Cream. Of course it doesn\\'t look pretty but it tastes really creamy. The rest meh, we didn\\'t like the taste, like some taste funny. For example, whatever they put in the carrot cake, it alter it\\'s flavor quite a bit. \\n\\nThey also carry a dine in menu. We finally have time to sit in and enjoy this time. I find out they have meat and sweet breakfast items. Variety flavors of smoothies and milkshakes. Also hot tea and caffeinated drinks.

Most are priced between $3-$4. I got three different ones to go. While they were all delicious, my favorite was the Colombian, a rich chocolate mousse with a little creme center with a layer of almond cake underneath, and then the whole thing was coated with a thin dark chocolate shell. My second favorite was a round pastry coated with hazelnuts with a Russian sounding name. The inside was a dense hazelnut cake. It was not very sweet at all. The Paris Brest was not a bad choice either with a thick layer of praline cream sandwiched between two light round pastry layers. \\n\\nThe total for those three pastries was $10.55. They also packaged them up nicely in a large take out container so we got them home in mint condition.

In 2017, are we really denying pregnant women access to public restrooms? And at a Starbucks no less?\\n\\nMy wife is 30 weeks pregnant and was seeking relief after a fair amount of eating, drinking, and walking along South Street.\\n\\nShe walked into the Starbucks at around 8:00pm and asked for a venti cup of ice water and the restroom key. The barista (a white male) told her restrooms were for paying customers only. She showed her belly and explained that being pregnant she really needed to use the restroom and he told her there was nothing he could do because it was store policy.\\n\\nMy wife walked out visibly shaken and told me what happened. I walked in with her and asked for clarification about the store policy. I\\'ve never known any other Starbucks to do this. I was told by the same barista that there was nothing they could do and they reiterated the store policy, saying it was a \"Philly Starbucks policy\".\\n\\nI told them that was ridiculous and asked if corporate was aware. Another employee (a white female) stepped up and told me that the reason they have this policy in place is because it is a \"safety issue\". My wife and I looked at her perplexed, so she continued explaining, saying that they let people use the bathroom and they end up shooting heroin and there\\'s been an uptick in crime.\\n\\nThis made me livid... I asked if she really thinks my pregnant wife is coming in their bathroom to shoot heroin and she just kept repeating it\\'s a safety issue.\\n\\nFed up, I said that I would be calling corporate to complain. She laughed and said I could go ahead and call corporate because they are the ones who made the policy and give them direction. I asked her for her name and she said she was not required to give it to me. I asked the other two employees and they also refused to give me their name saying they are not required to do so.\\n\\nFrustrated, I said, that I would take a venti Cafe mocha and the restroom key. I figured policy aside, my wife needed to use the bathroom so I\\'ll just buy something. The female employee said that she is choosing to refuse me service and that I need to leave the store or she would call the police.\\n\\nShocked by her brash reactions and the fact that the other two staff seemed to think this entire exchange was funny, I said this whole thing was crazy and headed out the door. As I was walking out, the female employee cursed at me saying, \"have a great f\\'ing day\". I walked back in and asked what she said and she kept threatening to call the police if I didn\\'t leave. I took out my phone and snapped a picture of them (see attached).\\n\\nI called corporate to complain about the situation and they indicated they would follow up with me. \\n\\nAll in all, I am incredibly disappointed in this particular location and the workers here. They were rude, condescending, and took every opportunity to insult and demean us. And given that the three employees and the few customers in the store at the time were all white and we are black, l can\\'t help but conclude that race played a factor here.\\n\\nWe spend entirely too much money on a daily basis at Starbucks to warrant this kind of treatment. And given their location on South Street (which gets busy at times), I can understand a customers-only policy, but they should consider expanding that to pregnant women and also people who are regular Starbucks customers. They should also evaluate individual circumstances and make informed, solutions-oriented decisions. \\n\\nVery disappointed.

I live near this location, so I've waited to write this review to make sure that nearly every experience I've had sucked. Well, it has. This is the WORST Starbucks I have EVER been to! Their service is absolutely terrible, unable to handle one customer, let alone a line with (oh my gosh) 2-4 people in it.  They only ever have pike place brewing, and the one time I opted to wait for a pour over, it took what felt like forever and my car was ticketed. Today, they ran out of pike place, and instead of giving me an immediate refund so I could be on my way, the girl behind the counter was flirting with her co-workers and diddly farting around behind the counter. I had to ask for her attention for my lousy refund! Anyone, Bueller? I can safely say that after countless bad experiences I will not be returning to this Starbucks.  If you're reading this, you know that Starbucks is on top of their game normally, this is not what you would expect.

There is nothing fancy or original about it and their products taste like every other one of their locations, so don't expect anything new on South Street either. However, the single, somewhat good and redeeming quality about this place is the lounge/sitting space on the top floor. I really enjoy reading a paper, or mostly, just looking out the window watching everything that is going on out at the corner of Third and South.

A number so sinister that it has hellacious written all over it. When you reach this milestone on Yelp you clearly have to write about something that represents your idea of hell (or Johnny Brenda\\'s if your Dave H. -1- but he\\'s still the man). So it sounds like the perfect time to sum up exactly how I feel about Starbucks. And since I already spelled it out for you many moons over (http://www.yelp.com/list/i-hate-starbucks-philadelphia) you know exactly where this one is going.\\n\\nMy overall thoughts of Starbucks has nothing to do with service or product. I\\'ve had decent service in plenty, and in spots like the one that I\\'m dropping this review on (you\\'ll go anywhere if certain people suggest it) I\\'ve had better than decent. And you can\\'t go wrong with the diverse selections of beans that they bring in, assortment of Tazo teas, and delicious treats that they offer for the most part. Although a lot of the prices can be pretty damn horrendous (there\\'s good reason why I affectionately call them Fourbucks). And they do provide a spacious decor that gives you plenty of room to get some work done if your in a bind (I like the upstairs that this one offers).\\n\\nBut in the land of lush and vibrant indie coffeehouses that is Philadelphia, Starbucks is pretty much the Soulless Empire. When you walk into a place like Chapterhouse that turns it\\'s surroundings into an art gallery; a spot like Last Drop that\\'s packed to the gills with good music, listings for local shows, and gratuitous people watching; or a spot like TBar that hooks up Scrabble and an amazing book exchange; the atmosphere brings you to life. But by comparison the atmosphere of Starbucks manages to suck the life right out of you. Every time I walk in and see the same typical looking art, the same cold plain decor, and total lack of vibrance, I can\\'t help but feel like a corporate slave digging a hole towards a corporate grave no matter what I\\'m doing. If you ever hear the words \"Grande soy latte two sugars\" coming out of my mouth feel free to slay me.\\n\\nBut the main reason I hate Starbucks is because, just like rats in the city, they\\'re freaking EVERYWHERE. If you walk down any major Philly street and see a Starbucks, and then it\\'s more than likely that you\\'ll come across another three blocks away, and then ANOTHER! It borders on the unnecessary, but rather than do something to lessen the amount (even when Starbucks announced the closing locations) it feels like their building more (http://www.yelp.com/biz/macys-philadelphia#hrid:6dm686CWJQrzhJAfGOcEwQ). Damn the Empire!\\n\\n-1- Dave H. did review Johnny Brenda\\'s as his 666. But it wasn\\'t because he found it evil.

I pull up start ordering, the workers are literally laughing playing around where I had to repeat my order 4 TIMES! Like pay attention I understand they might be young but you have a job to do, might I add one you\\'re getting paid for so do it! Management seemed to not care, my order was wronG AND COLD! Fries were so bad like they hadn\\'t changed the oil bad after taste. \\n\\n3.) TONIGHT!

She goes no I\\'m like huh well can I get a snack size m&m mcflurry with the m&ms on the side (which I have done multiple times by using the \"ask me\" tab WHICH BY THE WAY IS FUCKING ALLOWED ITS FUCKING MCDONALDS! she kept telling me she couldn\\'t do it , her manager refused at this point I\\'m so frustrated I leave because WHY IS THERE ALWAYS A PROBLEM?????? WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE A PROBLEM HERE!! \\n\\nLiterally throw the whole staff away, and get new management, and maybe a new owner because this shit is horrible!

The cashier made me my coffee but I asked for a meal ticket for lunch since I waited so long for my coffee and had to come inside to get it. When I explain to the manager what happened and if I could get a meal ticket for waiting so long she told me it wasn't lunch yet and was very rude with a nasty attitude. The manager told me I need to come back during lunch as if I was a bum begging for food. All I wanted was to get some kind of free meal ticket for waiting so long for a coffee that they forgot to send to me. I don't need they food at all. I can buy my own food but it's just the principle of the situation. This is the second time this has happened to me at this same McDonald's. They will NEVER get my business again!!!!!!

I\\'ve really never had an issue before, but this Cosi was the exception.\\n\\nI work right around the corner so I went there today for the first time for a quick bite. I entered the store and was greeted by a sign that said Salads to the right, Sandwiches to the left. I was confused because at every other Cosi I\\'ve been to you just order at the register and they bring the food to the table. I was also ordering a Taste two (half salad+half sandwich) so I wasn\\'t sure which line to get in. I decided on the salad line because it seemed like the logical progression of the line to the register. \\n\\nI get to the front of the line and the guy asks me what I want. I told him I wanted the taste two with a Signature Salad and a Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwich. Without looking at me he asks \"White or wheat\"? I had no idea he was talking to me and I could hardly hear because it was loud. When I didn\\'t answer he yelled at me and was extremely rude. When I told him what I wanted he went over to the sandwich people and told them my sandwich order. He then told me to slide down to the other side and wait for my sandwich.\\n\\nI noticed that everyone else in line got an order slip to bring up to the register. I got nothing, but I assumed the sandwich people would give me one when they were finished making other people\\'s orders. I was standing there waiting while three more people ordered and received their sandwiches and eventually I thought there was no way it was taking them that long to make my order. After standing there for about 7 minutes I asked the lady if someone was making mine and she said the guy in the back was. Well I noticed he was making a full sized sandwich and I ordered a half size. I notified her of this, and she asked me if I ever got an order slip. I said no. She wrote one up for me and told me I could go pay at the register and they would bring me my sandwich. \\n\\nI figured they would just give me the whole sandwich that they had already made to make up for the fact that I had been waiting for so long (which they never really acknowledged even though I was waiting directly in front of the counter AND the manager walked past several times). They gave me a half sandwich anyway. What did they do? Cut the sandwich in half and throw out the rest? Make a whole new sandwich? They never even asked if my order was for there or to go. I wanted to eat in house but they wrapped everything up and didn\\'t give me a tray.\\n\\nWhen I finally sat down, I opened my salad and it was pretty lacking. Whenever I\\'ve eaten at cosi the salad is usually very sizable with the lettuce piled above the rim of the bowl. Since they had given me a lid (because they never asked if I was eating there or to go) there was hardly any lettuce, and what was there was absolutely DRENCHED in dressing. I\\'m talking, when I was finished eating, there was at least a centimeter of dressing remaining at the bottom of the bowl. They also gave me white bread when I had ordered wheat.\\n\\nI gave it two stars because, besides the bread being wrong, my Sandwich was ok. I had never had that particular sandwich from Cosi before so I have nothing to compare it to, but for what its worth I liked it. I\\'ll be fair.\\n\\nThis is the first Cosi I have been to for a few months, so I have no idea if Cosi just changed their ordering layout or if this particular location is one of the only ones that does it this way. It was completely unorganized and prone to error. I will not be returning to this Cosi location which is a shame, because it is the closest one to my work and I really do enjoy Cosi\\'s food.

Horrible Horrible Operations at this location!!  \\n\\nPlease Cosi Management - send someone who knows what they are doing to set some standards at this location!!\\n\\nSampling of various visits over the last 4 months.  \\n\\n1.  As other reviewers commented, there are 2 lines, one for sandwiches and the other for salads.  The lines are \"loose\" - you can usually order from either line - the people behind the counter don\\'t seem to care.  Nor do they care if someone walks up ahead of you and orders, they don\\'t really notice who is in line.  There is no semblance of order.  \\n\\n2.  The menu clearly states a price for Half Salad and Full Salad.  I tried to order a half salad and the person making my salad (who has worked there as long as I have been going there - 4 months) told me I can only get a half salad if I get a Half and Half option (half soup/salad/sandwich).  Well, that is not what the menu says, but nevertheless I ordered a full salad.  At the cashier I asked if it was possible to order a half salad as stated on the menu board.  She said, hmm, I\\'m not sure, and looked at the cash register.  Then she said, yes, because it is on the register, I guess you can.  \\n\\n3.  The menu clearly states that you can substitute any meat with Grilled Tofu.  My friend ordered a salad and asked to substitute the chicken for tofu.  They salad guy said \"what?  Oh no, we don\\'t have any of that.\"  My friend pointed out what it says on the menu and he frantically ran around shouting \"Do we have tofu, do we have tofu?\"  Nobody else knew what he was talking about so he came back and said \"no we don\\'t have tofu.\"  My friend again pointed out that the menu says they have it and he again asked a couple of people and said \"no sorry, I don\\'t know why the menu says that.\" The woman at the cash register confirmed that they do have tofu.\\n\\n4.  Cosi Card - they have a Cosi card which you can get if you ask for it.  I asked the cashier for it one day after my transaction and he gave me one.  I asked why he didn\\'t ask if I had a card before my purchase and he said \"oh, we aren\\'t trained to ask before a purchase.\"  Dumb.  Dumb.  Also, why can\\'t I use my phone # when I come back to get credit for my purchase.  Why do I physically have to carry my card around instead of being able to give my phone number like most rewards programs?\\n\\n5.  Tables dirty - usually\\n\\n6.  Agree with another review - they will have a guy rolling out bread when there are 10 people in line.  Shouldn\\'t that be done during downtime?\\n\\n7.  They people behind the counter don\\'t look up.  They\\'ll stand there with a line of people seemingly not noticing that people are waiting to order.\\n\\nI could go on.  Unfortunately, we moved into the Bourse Building across from Cosi 4 months ago and Cosi is the closest place where I can get a decent salad so I and my co-workers go there more than we would like.  The food inside the Bourse Building is pretty bad.  \\n\\nThe food at Cosi is generally good, I just really wish they would get their act together Operationally.

From my experience not all COSI have someone bringing you the food, especially if it is for breakfast. So we go to the area where the food is being made to wait for the food. We were told to have a seat and that someone will bring us our food. We wait for a long time and the food is coming very slowly. The place was not that busy when we went, there were only three people working - the cashier, a cook and someone that looked like the manager. So obviously the manager would be responsible for running the food. There were 8 of us and each of us easily waited 10-15 minutes for our simple breakfast sandwich and oatmeal.

There are so many choices that it can make anyone have a favorite to choose from. I loved the fall flavors, like pumpkin pie and harvest apple. However, the caramel apple was the best. The filling was like apple pie filling, so it was so moist. I am also a fan of the Nutella and Oreo, however, the filling is the white cream. I wish there was Nutella filling or a cookies and cream filling. The PB and J donut is also really good. I like the contrast between the PB creme and the fresh jam.

Of course, in part because of the fact that I am a scientist who works with fermented foods and nutritional supplements, I am well aware of the health benefits of eating fermented foods, and of the even far more powerful health benefits afforded by long-fermented grain products such as long-fermented pizza dough.\\n\\nI should also mention that I have, in the past, made batches of long-fermented sourdough bread where the dough had been fermented for 3 to 4 days before cooking the loaf. In fact, it is safe to go further and say that I am a connoisseur of long-fermented breads and other dough-based products. The flavor and texture of long-fermented dough products alone make them stand out heads and shoulders above other baked products, and the added nutritional benefits are just one more plus!\\n\\nI first discovered this unique and worthy shop while on a walk one morning while visiting Philadelphia a few years ago. When I walked in to check out the shop, I was stunned, and incredibly pleased, to discover that they make the dough for all of their pizza and other dough-based products only using long-fermentation methods, wherein the dough is allowed to ferment for at least 72 hours before baking! Yummy! \\n\\nSince that time, every time that I visit Philadelphia -- which is usually twice per year, for about 7-8 days per stay -- I always visit this shop to pick up a few slices of pizza, which I then bring back to my room, where I eat as much as I can, and then the rest goes in the fridge for later meals.\\n\\nThe quality of this pizza, and particularly of the dough, is nothing short of amazing and incredible. The dough is so light and fluffy, and yet so tasty, that it seems almost impossible that such an incredible food actually exists, and these characteristics are all due entirely to the long fermentation time and the high-quality products used in making the dough (and the toppings as well).\\n\\nIn fact, it is 12:40 PM as I write this review, and one hour ago I walked from my hotel to this shop to purchase a few slices of their pizza to go. I then walked the box a few blocks back to my hotel room, where I devoured almost 3 slices, and the remainder went into my fridge.\\n\\nI can honestly say that I have never tasted a better pizza dough, nor a better fermented bread or sourdough bread product than the dough/crust in this pizza, anywhere in the world. This shop is my sole go-place for pizza made with long-fermented dough.  \\n\\nMy only regret is that they do not offer loaves of bread made with this dough! It would be downright incredible! In fact, I also wish that they would consider offering for sale, via the web, frozen loaves of partially-cooked long-fermented bread and pizza crust, and if they did, I would probably purchase a dozen frozen loaves per month, to be delivered via Fedex or UPS to my rural home in the Appalachian mountains!\\n\\nIn closing, all that I can say is that the texture, taste and flavor of this pizza is amazing!

We called 1 hour to close (we live a few blocks away) and while I can\\'t remember what she ordered, I know that I got the BLT + A. Everything was fine and dandy until we got there and realized it\\'s cash only (I know, I\\'m one of those people but it\\'s 2017! Come on!) So my roommate goes to take out cash and I noticed the bill was incredibly high. I asked to look at the receipt and see we were charged an EXTRA $2 for EACH sandwich for the avocado. I asked the woman at the front what that was for, and she pointed to a sign on the counter that said that avocado would be a $2 upcharge because of demand or something like that. So, let me tell you that both sandwiches are ALREADY made with avocado, with mine having \"avocado\" in the name. How are you going to charge $2 for a few slices of avocado on a $6 sandwich? That makes no sense. I would understand if I added avocado to an existing sandwich that didn\\'t already have one, but the $6 price already reflects the cost of the avocado. My second qualm here is that when we called, WE WERE NEVER TOLD OF THE UPCHARGE! I would have gotten something else with no issue. \\n\\nWhen both of these points were raised to the extremely rude worker at the front, she scowled and gave myself and my roommate and attitude. I asked for the manager and she said that they were not there and \"even if they were here, they would say the same thing.\" Words cannot describe how incredibly rude this woman/girl...I\\'ll call her a girl...was to us. No \"I\\'m sorry for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately this is our current policy. I\\'d be happy to remove the avocado for you if you wouldn\\'t like to pay\" or anything pleasant of the sort! We left without the food. \\n\\nSo that was the one bad apple. However, I decided to give it another try yesterday morning because I really do love gluten free and vegan foods. This experience was significantly better. I essentially took like 5 things off of the menu in other items and created my own \"concoction\" and they were very accommodating and helpful! They even made the thing look pretty, too! \\n\\nOverall, I think I will be back...just not at night when that awful person is there.

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED -

We sat outside which was nicely decorated. Very spacious. Good menu choices but not overwhelming. We had the breakfast burrito and the tres leches bread (\"pan\" on the menu). Fantastic! The refried beans instead of rice in the burrito was really great and kept it from being dry. And the home fries were great too. The pan was delicious. Not overly sweet honestly, although it was quite a large helping of food. Fresh strawberries and pecans finished it off nicely. I also had a mango lemonade which was nice and not overly sweet. \\n\\nPrices were reasonable, service was quick. Whats not to like! Finally a place that does brunch just differently to make it feel familiar yet better than many other brunch experiences around here. Check em out!

Tucked away between Italian market stores, this place has both indoor and outdoor seating options. My friend and I came on a chillier day and it wasn't too bad sitting outside since it's tented and has individual heating stands. The staff were welcoming and quickly showed us to our seats. I loved the extensive menu that covers all day meals from breakfast to dinner. We ended up sharing a few items including guac and chips, calamari tacos and lobster benedict. We had come during the day time and it wasn't terribly packed but in terms of service time, the food did take quite a while to prepare. We got our guac and chips and finished the whole serving of chips, got a refill of chips and almost finished that, all while we were having more lengthier casual conversations, before we got our other foods. The guac was really refreshing though, though a bit chilled. As for the calamari itself, that was really yummy and had a nice batter ratio. It didn't necessarily need the taco piece of it though as the two didn't quite fit together. For the benedict, the lobster was a bit dry and tough but otherwise can't go too wrong with lobster.

Food is a solid 4-4.5/5 and the service is a 5/5.\\n\\nThere were so many items on the menu we wanted to try, so we opted for ordering a bunch of things to try, versus any entrees. We ordered the grilled kale salad $15, crab and corn chowder $10,  grilled cauliflower $13, elote $4, calamari $18, and had the pineapple water $3. In total our bill came to $69 before tip and we both went home with 2 full boxes of leftovers. \\n\\nThe crab and corn chowder was flavorful, and full of crab. The grilled kale salad was delicious with the char, but slightly overdressed, the shrimp was good. The cauliflower was delicious, loved the salsa rosa and salad that it came with and the portion was lovely. The elote was one of the best I've had, get it. The calamari had such a nice light batter and was well fried and seasoned. Our server forgot our pineapple water, and kept apologizing and was so kind through our night. The pineapple water brought me back to my travels in Central America, would definitely recommend, it will ship you straight to the tropics. Also, since we shared everything - I figured they would bring us 2 spoons for the soup but they divided the portion into two bowls which was so thoughtful and cute. Lastly, at the end of our night we were brought out flan for dessert on the house. Also *BYOB* no corkage fee!\\n\\nApparently they were also featured on queer eye, I had no idea. But I loved the food, the service, and the happy smiles of the lovely staff at this family owned restaurant. I would definitely recommend a visit and I can't wait to go back to try some actual entrees!

Had (Philly\\'s favorite) La Colombe coffee and The Inferno (scrambled eggs, chorizo & cheddar with jalape\u00f1o hash & ghost pepper slaw, avocado, insanity aioli & chipotles on a habanero wrap), which they say is \"hotter than a Kensington Tire Fire\" (which did not disappoint) - an excellent combination of flavors that I\\'ll soon order again after trying some other offerings. The premises are cozy & welcoming - the kind of coffee shop to open a book and hangout awhile. The decor is Star Wars themed (plus a nice smattering of artwork depicting local places) and that theme is ubiquitous; I sat at a table adjacent to R2D2 & ET and, when I asked for the WiFi password, I was challenged to cite the 1st two words Princess Leia speaks. Hosts Jeff & (owner) Terrance were most welcoming (and generous). The fun continues ma\u00f1ana with http://facebook.com/events/2035365283257795.

The owner displays his paintings and recently, they held an art show for a local artist who is displaying his work for a month.\\n7. Sandwiches: They serve both breakfast and lunch options which are only limited by the ingredient choice and your imagination. My current sandwich of choice is cream cheese, turkey, tomato, and cucumber on a multigrain bagel.\\n8. Salad: Any sandwich can be made into a salad or anything you imagine can be a salad.

The Curry Chicken Salad: I'll admit, I was disappointed because I was expecting a Jamaican curry but I quickly got over it.

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED - informational only)\n1. **TOTAL_REVIEWS**: Count of all reviews in the dataset\n\n**L2: Raw Extraction** (NON-SCORED - simple keyword counting)\n2. **SEVERE_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'reaction', 'hospital', 'nuts everywhere'\n3. **MILD_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'peanut oil', 'cross contamination', 'got sick'\n4. **POSITIVE_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'accommodated', 'dedicated fryer', 'checked with chef', 'safe for allergy', 'allergy menu'\n5. **GOOD_HYGIENE**: Count keyword mentions across ALL reviews for: 'clean', 'spotless', 'immaculate', 'shining', 'sanitary'\n6. **BAD_HYGIENE**: Count keyword mentions across ALL reviews for: 'dirty', 'filthy', 'grime', 'sticky', 'gross', 'bugs', 'roach'\n\n**L3: Basic Aggregation** (SCORED)\n7. **REVIEW_DENSITY**: TOTAL_REVIEWS / 10.0\n8. **STAR_VARIANCE**: AvgStars -

First we ordered 2 of the peanut butter & Nutella smoothies & asked the server how it was made because I wanted one without bananas in it. He said he didn't know how it was made because it's made in the kitchen (whatever that's supposed to mean because if you're a server these are basic things you should know) he also said there wasn't any peanut butter & when I asked the other server he said there wasn't any Nutella. So I was confused about what they had & ordered 2 berry smoothies if there wasn't any peanut butter or if they Couldn't take out the bananas & I asked if he could check with the kitchen first before anything & let us know & he made us pay for everything before we even tried any of what we ordered. We paid & tipped before any of our things came, while everyone else had the opportunity to pay once they were done their meal (there were 3 other tables in front of us that we watched this happen) We got our food & smoothies( we received one smoothie without any Nutella when I never asked for that ) didn't like the smoothies so we asked if they can just give us orange juice in exchange for one smoothie we didn't like, yet they still tried to charge us for one small $4 cup of orange juice. Our tabs total came up to $66 with the tip included & they couldn't give us a complimentary orange juice? I was about to pay for it with my card when my boyfriend tried to take my card because we were just going to leave a $5 bill for the orange juice. The server tried to snatch my card from his hand & I asked to speak to a manager & he insisted he was the manager. We said we weren't going to pay for the orange juice because that was terrible service as paying customers. He also said he was going to charge us for the orange juice anyways without our permission.

There was the creamy, lemony hummus; tabbouleh; stuffed grape leaves; four crispy falafels with tahini sauce; and my favorites, a refreshing fattoush salad made of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, pita chips, and sumac; and a smokey baba ghanoush. There was just as much emphasis placed on the presentation of each dish as on the flavors, and each of the meza plates was meticulously garnished: a sprinkling of paprika and olive oil on the hummus, sumac on the baba ghanoush, and pickles/lettuce/tomatoes with the grape leaves. All the food was fresh and delicious, and the mezas were served with two flat, chewy pita breads on the side, which were perfect for wiping up the dips and eating with the salads!', 'date': '2021-09-03 20:04:23', 'user': {'name': 'David', 'review_count': 1741, 'yelping_since': '2016-07-25 01:23:29', 'elite': '2016,2017,2018,2019,20,20,2021', 'average_stars': 4.07, 'fans': 122}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'OYif2K9ikGjMQ8ivKLT3Eg', 'user_id': 'DrvmH6hJifrAyqQR0Sliww', 'business_id': 'irXywqvfXj9maLLOBQMYvg', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'This place is still my go-to Middle Eastern restaurant in Philly so far.

Once paid you will get a number to place on your table. With this number system I'm not sure if it was for the staff to bring you your food or for you to pickup once your food is ready. I saw both scenarios happening when I was there. \\n\\nThe menu:\\n-The menu is substantive and has many options for different dietary restrictions. \\n-There are a few parts of the menu which are confusing since they seem similar with other menu items, however the person behind the counter was able to clarify easily for us. \\n-We noticed this after, but there is a printed menu available at the counter, not only the one above the counter as we had thought.\\n-There is signage at the counter indicating that due to rising costs, all prices will be increased by 5% from what is stated. However checking in on Yelp yields a 5% off purchase coupon.\\n\\nFood:\\n-The portions are huge and easily shared\\n-The pita is made to order and very delicious \\n-Everyone in the group enjoyed their order.\\n-The bakery's menu looked delicious but sadly most items were out of stock. \\n\\nWith all the positives listed above, you may be wondering why the three star review.  The bathroom was absolutely filthy and disgusting. I am hoping it's due to a fluke but it was bad enough to dock a star. Upon future visits If the situation improves I will update my review. \\n\\nAdditionally the whole numbering system is frankly confusing. Some of us had our food brought to us. Others had to keep looking at the area where food that was ready to see if our order was there.  The restaurant was not busy so we were unsure what the deal was. This resulted in loss of a star since the last person in our group to get their food, where the rest of the group was already midway through theirs. This resulted in the loss of another star. \\n\\nOverall I would give Manakeesh another chance and also would love to try their bakery. I hope they take the feedback and address it. \\n\\nThings to know:\\n-It will be easier to look and order off printed menu versus one displayed above counter\\n-Indoor and outdoor seating available\\n-Pay attention to food that is ready to be served, your order may be stuck there if you are waiting for it to be brought to you \\n-Guest WiFi available \\n-Come prepared with hand sanitizer to wash your hands versus using the bathroom. And do your best to avoid having to use the restaurant restroom. You will thank me later. \\n-Cutlery, napkins, and water are self served.  However the water cups are TINY (like 4 sips) so be prepared to refill often or (what I recommend) bring your own refillable water bottle/cup. \\n-Street parking only\\n-There is a small section stocked with different items such as honey, Turkish delight, nuts, candy, etc. \\n-Manakeesh has their own app for you to place delivery orders and get discounts from\", 'date': '2021-06-26 12:37:04', 'user': {'name': 'Manta', 'review_count': 71, 'yelping_since': '2010-05-04 22:47:11', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.78, 'fans': 0}}\n[R25] {'review_id': 'EzCPE43WMBBBO9ZITcJBXw', 'user_id': 'pJ35nordG8JE59FBRoyTfQ', 'business_id': 'irXywqvfXj9maLLOBQMYvg', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Comfortable space, delicious food, great tea and snacks.

Why three times, instead of my usual pre-review requirement of two? Well...in spite of all the other adoring reviews, and in spite of the fact that Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite, I just wasn't having great luck with my orders, until this past Friday. \\nSo let's start with the best, and work back to most disappointing;\\nOn Friday I ordered a grape leaves wrap for dinner. I knew that I really liked their stuffed grape leaves (or, as known by their Greek name, dolmades) and how can you go wrong with fattoush salad (hold the onions!) and baba ghanoush? Well, they forgot to hold the onions, but they did call me not 5 minutes after my pick-up to apologize and offer to replace the whole meal. I told them not to worry, and I was glad I did (the onions were few and easy to pick out anyway). It was a really great wrap, and a perfect portion. Flavorful and filling, but not too much so. My partner got the falafel platter, which he really liked, but the massive hummus portion packs a punch - you might not want to finish it in a single sitting. \\nSo I knew I liked the stuffed grape leaves thanks to the ma'ali platter. That was from visit number two. Sadly, that was the only thing I completely enjoyed from that meal (which I shared with my partner, together with a cheese manakeesh). The fried cauliflower, eggplant and potatoes were tasty enough, but so loaded down with oil that I really didn't feel great soon after. As for the cheese manakeesh...I just don't get it. What am I missing?\\nMy first visit was the biggest disappointment. I ordered the cheese and spinach manakeesh. The spinach was so briny I could barely eat it. I guess I was expecting a more Greek-style cheese-spinach blend, and this was not that. I mean, I love pickled cucumbers, but Manakeedh goes super heavy on vinegar and pickled foods, at least on everything I've had.\\nNot the most glowing review, and it really feels more like 3.5 than 4 stars, but I gave the full 4 because the service is great, very quick, friendly and mindful, and everyone else I've gone with has really enjoyed their food. I'm really tempted to try one of their vegetarian savory crepes, but I'm not sure yet if there will be a fourth visit.

So my girlfriend told the cashier that we weren\\'t sure if we were going to order because of the lack of available seating. Before she even finished this sentence, the cashier smirked, pointed to the line like we didn\\'t know it was there, and gestured to the person behind us to place their order. She didn\\'t say a single word to us. \\n\\nI understand that that isn\\'t the type of thing a cashier wants to hear when it is busy. We were, however, going to ask her for just a second to decide what we wanted to do. But apparently she didn\\'t feel like giving us the chance. It\\'s like she felt that she was doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to order, and since we had inconvenienced her so terribly she decided to revoke that privilege. Overall, this woman came off as impatient and condescending. I must say it is ironic for a cashier to have a superiority complex. \\n\\nThe very fact that there was no available seating was also, in itself, annoying. Normally this wouldn\\'t bother me, but I looked around a bit and noticed that about half of the customers were sitting there typing away on their Macbooks while nursing small coffees (some of them were just drinking water from Nalgene bottles). Even worse, many of them were sitting alone at tables meant for multiple people. And worst of all, every single one of them was a hipster. \\n\\nI know I am going to tick a lot of people off with these comments, but let\\'s be serious here: Mugshots isn\\'t just a \"coffee shop\" like Starbucks. They also serve breakfast and lunch. And people would like the opportunity to sit down and eat said foodstuffs. But they don\\'t get the chance if everyone else thinks its acceptable to buy a cup of coffee and then sit there for extended periods of time writing term papers, brooding poetry, or whatever they consider to be trendy.

What does a girl want more than an egg sandwich on a Saturday morning. Instead of nice eggs, folded over from the griddle, I received some baked holey mess. Instead of cheese spilling over the eggs it was seemingly absent.\\n\\nWhen inquiring about the aesthetics and taste of the rubbery eggs the one employee began an obviously rehearsed spiel about how more people prefer their eggs baked and fluffy, that it's healthier and the eggs are so local they were fresh, just delivered yesterday. \\n\\nTo give credit where credit is due, he did try to accommodate by offering to make the sandwich again, yet it would still be baked into a square chunky mess of holey eggs. I declined and he told me that all major chains like Dunkin Donuts and Wawa bake their eggs, still harping on how most people prefer it that way.\\n\\nIf I was looking for shitty baked eggs I would go to Wawa, pay way less and wouldn't regret trying to get decent food from a presumably locally owned establishment. \\n\\nIt was at this point that the one line-cook offered to fry me some eggs on the griddle, something that the other employee never even offered. I was grateful that someone was listening to a customer's opinion instead of reciting what popular opinion polls found. \\n\\nI understand new owners mean a new style of doings things, but I didn't think when the shop boasted on Facebook about shorter waiting times it meant they were industrializing local and creating a more popular, yet less tasty egg.\\n\\nI will have to look elsewhere for a morning breakfast sandwich, unfortunately I am of the apparent minority who prefers an old fashioned egg.

While the cashier was friendly, the manager was making espresso drinks and it took a good 15 min. to get my decaf latte. It took 2 attempts.

Maybe (but probably not) someone at Mugshots will care this time. \\n\\nToday: Brought all my school work and computers down to Mugshots to work on school work. There Wi-fi is accessible for 60 minutes only with purchase and with a code provided by the cashier (I am not even complaining about this fact but still, come one guys, free wi-fi is a little give for a lot of get in the coffee shop world. Your image could use a boost.). I also ordered an egg, tomato, guacamole, and cheese sandwich and an americano. Americano was fine. Sandwich was made with obviously old guac...it was brown, cold, and flavorless as avocados tend to become when refrigerated for too long. I was contemplating asking for a different sandwich but then I thought better of it because I would just be met with blank stares and don\\'t care attitudes (those things are extremely commonplace with the staff). The first code I received for wi-fi access came up with \"promotional access denied.\" So I asked for assistance, was given another code, and that one did not work either. When I went back to the counter and said that it didn\\'t work either the guy said he didn\\'t know. He asked two of his co-workers about it and they said \"Last time it happened, we had to call the company.\" Then the three of them kinda stood there with blank stares (like I said, a common response). Then the guy said \"Well, how do I do that.\" One girl shrugged her shoulders and the other said \"Oh, I don\\'t know I don\\'t go into the office.\" More blank stares then the guy said to me, \"Sorry, I don\\'t know what to do.\" What?! You DO know what to do, dude. Call the company and fix the problem. Obviously this has happened before as your co-workers pointed out and obviously the solution is to call the provider. However, none of them wanted to do it so I was told \"Too bad.\" Really, Mugshots? You know how to solve a problem but you don\\'t do it because...you\\'re lazy? You don\\'t want to? It\\'s not \"your\" job? What is it? This is a common theme throughout all of my negative experiences here. Disconnected, disinterested, too-cool-for-school employees who can\\'t be bothered with simple customer service. \\n\\nA summary of other complaints:\\n\\n1. A few weeks ago I ordered an Americano. There were three people at the registers and one person in the kitchen area. I waited 18 minutes (I timed it on my phone) before I said anything. I said \"excuse me, is someone going to make my drink?\" Yes, I said it with a little bit of an attitude. The girl stared at me (blank stares!) then said, \"Yea, give me am minute\" and went back to the registers where two other people were (there are only two registers so...) Two minutes later she went to the espresso machine clearly annoyed and sloppily made my drink. It was filled all the way to the top making it difficult to carry to the condiment stand. I felt it was done on purpose. My evidence: the smirk and \"here you go\" delivered with an attitude when she handed me the drink.\\n\\n2. Last Saturday morning (an insanely busy time at Mugshots) I was waiting in line along with 16 other customers (I counted because I wanted to write a Yelp review and be accurate) for my morning coffee. Some man walks in the door, cuts to an open register before the woman waiting in line gets to it. The woman seemed confused and said she was too embarrassed to say anything so I leaned over and said to the cashier, \"That man just cut in front of everyone.\" The cashier look flustered, said \"oh, I just got here\" and continued to help the man instead of asking him to wait in line. Yea, no. \\n\\n3. The food and drink are over-priced for the quality of customer service. I understand that Mugshots supports local and sustainable farms and I truly appreciate that and understand that that means higher prices. I wouldn\\'t have a problem paying them if I was treated like the PAYING customer that I am.\\n\\n\\nSo, the reason why I keep going here is two-fold. One, I live 4 blocks away and I will put up with a lot for convenience and non-Starbucks coffee. Two, I\\'m somehow convinced it will get better. I, for some reason, believe management will catch on to the arrogant, disrespectful ignorant way it\\'s staff operates and make changes.

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED -

I even order it some weekends and drive a distance to there now just because it\\'s so good.  Once you\\'re in the mood for Alex\\'s, nothing else will do.  The staff is always so friendly and has always been.  When I walk in there to pick up, I feel like I\\'m home again, that\\'s the best feeling.  People who expect them to sell other foods, get over it.  It\\'s pizza, it\\'s what they do best and that\\'s it.  I guess for those of us who grew up there, we always knew what it was like and we know what to expect.

I spent many weekends of my youth eating Alex's pizzas and even now still enjoy having a pizza from here.  One funny story about Alex's pizza is that when I was a toddler, at one time, I wouldn't eat my pizza without candy on it.  So, my uncle threw a bunch of gummy bears on the pizza and we ate it like that.  Apparently, according to my uncle, it wasn't bad.  I don't remember this experience as it has been many years but maybe, just maybe, I will recreate this gummy bear pizza one day. \\n\\nThey are located on the corner of Leverington Avenue and Pechin Street where you will see a very small set of steps leading down to the entrance of the tiny pizza shop.  There is one table in here as their main method of food service is takeout.  The employees are friendly and I even noticed that one of the employees has been there throughout my entire experience here.  The pizzas are made right in the front of the shop, so you can watch the process of other pizzas being made while you pick yours up or wait for it.  Over the years, the ownership changed more than once, I believe, and the pizza flavor and texture changed with it.  At some points along the timeline Alex's Pizzeria had their downsides but I believe they are back on their feet as my girlfriend and I enjoyed their pizza the last time we had it.  The hard part is keeping their pizza hot when driving from their location to my current home location.  If you don't live close, plan to eat in the car or bring one of those bags that keep your food warm in the car.\\n\\nOverall, I have been a fan of Alex's Pizzeria my entire life and plan to keep coming back for more of their pizza.  I recommend this place to anyone looking to experience a good Philadelphia pizza shop.\", 'date': '2014-02-25 03:56:15', 'user': {'name': 'Jay', 'review_count': 144, 'yelping_since': '2013-08-13 02:49:09', 'elite': '2014,2015', 'average_stars': 4.17, 'fans': 13}}\n[R35] {'review_id': 'kXMaulbmqLCKOymaHUx63A', 'user_id': 'IyTBI7li0LpqEqyWbrqhqw', 'business_id': '12rhY0NEtsiy_9S0oug2mA', 'stars': 3.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'There is a lot of hype about this place, and sadly, it doesn\\'t quite live up to it.

I live right around the corner from Alex's, so after driving past it every day, I figured I'd give them a shot after my fail with Roma's Pizza on Ridge. \\n\\nThey have no website and no menu. After calling, I learned that they only offer pizzas - no wings, breadsticks, or anything else. JUST PIZZA. A little disappointing because I was craving wings, but I guess they stick to what they know. My favorite type of pizza has everything on it, so I asked for nearly all of their ingredients - pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, mushrooms, black olives, onions, and peppers. It ended up being over $20 because you pay by the topping! Totally ridiculous.... AND when I walked in ready to pay with my credit card, I am told it is CASH ONLY and am directed to the nearest ATMs instead of getting my pizza. Why on earth would you not tell someone this over phone when they order?!?\\n\\nThe only redeeming factor was the quality of the ingredients. They were fresh and delicious, especially the sausage, which were sliced sausage links instead of the little sausage bits/balls. \\n\\nHowever, they piled too many ingredients on one pizza. I used to work at a pizza place in high school, and the more ingredients you add, the less of each you are supposed to use; otherwise, it will get too heavy, and the dough can't support the weight of the toppings. While the cost trade off was there ($20 for a mountain of toppings), I had to eat the pizza with a fork and knife because the dough was not thick enough to hold it all. Also, the dough ended up getting soggy by the time I got it home, since I had to run to the bank on Ridge to get cash to pay.\\n\\nOverall, good quality ingredients, good location to my house (two blocks away), but poor advertisement, which does not make it condusive for new customers.

I went here almost every month for \"date night\" with my wife before we would go to movies and it was the best Italian food I had ever had. Nothing in Michigan came close to the authentic Italian food that they served. When relatives were in town from Michigan we took them here and they agreed, this place was amazing. This place was the best until they changed the menu. They used to serve fresh bread from their oven that was literally worth the trip itself, now they serve bread that you can pick up at shoprite. The menu has been downsized to such a miniscule variety of the same themed food that its redundant to even try new things here. It seems like the menu has been downsized to reduce costs but from the reviews here it seems like it has also reduced appeal. They had a \"build your own\" pasta menu that had more variety than their entire menu does now. The portions are smaller now, there are fewer choices now, the price has gone up, but the service remains decent. The staff is friendly but they went from serving \"grandma\\'s house\" to chef boyarde. Go here if you have never had decent Italian food and you will have a somewhat pleasant experience. Don\\'t go here if you went here 2 years ago and loved it, it will ruin your opinion of this place. I\\'m giving it 2 stars for the memories and the service (after all I have been here literally about 30 times). My wife grew up in philly, she can make me the food that they now serve here.

The arrabbiata sauce wasn't even listed on the menu anymore, and when the dish came out, my gnocchi were dense and the sauce was overwhelmingly oily and not spicy at all. \\n\\nWhen we looked online, we saw the old menu was still posted, and they had RAISED THE PRICES for many items-- my gnocchi used to be $10.95 but is now $13.50 for half the portion. The pizza my boyfriend got was also no longer made with fresh mozzarella. While the service is okay, they've definitely lost our return business. It's very apparent that they're trying to cut costs or save money, but in the process will probably lose loyal customers. There's just nothing special about this place anymore. It's just another no-personality Italian restaurant in a strip mall.\", 'date': '2014-01-13 00:11:20', 'user': {'name': 'Erica', 'review_count': 18, 'yelping_since': '2013-12-21 05:59:40', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.21, 'fans': 0}}\n[R37] {'review_id': 'oJwWut-_ui6FY3FvH88xUw', 'user_id': 'QqETYDUfjIHAY2-XKIsAZw', 'business_id': 'Ddupo1zhmoct1yPFbF6ipQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Great new menu! the service and food was great as always.

They used to serve fresh pizza dough cooked from their fire/coal oven as the \"bread basket\" but last night they only gave us a basket of sliced bread. We ordered a calamari appetizer and the portion was definitely smaller than before. Luckily, the calamari was still pretty good.  As for the main courses, our table ordered the gnocchi, lasagna, braciole, and shrimp scampi. The braciole was lukewarm at best, and the meat sauce was bland. The gnocchi was OK with butter sage cream sauce, but the lasagna and shrimp scampi were both bland and unexciting.

Why would he sell pizza with real cheese claiming it is daiya?? \\n\\nFor those of you unaware, daiya is a plant-based cheese that is really high quality and tastes amazingly like real cheese. Though the taste is decieving, the appearance is not. It does not melt or brown. \\n\\nI have made my fair share pizza and mac n' cheese using daiya.., never, not once has the cheese browned like real cheese when it has been baked. Not when i've baked it 20 minutes, not when i've baked it for an hour. My boyfriend and I ordered our pizza, waited 20 minutes for it to cook, and then picked it up. \\n\\nWe sat down and began to eat. I looked down and realized that the cheese I was eating was stretching, and was crisped brown on the top. Plant based cheese does not brown or stretch, as it is not real cheese. I started to feel very nervous and scared I was going to get sick, since I have not eaten animal products for a long time. \\n\\nWe took it back inside, and asked the owner about it.

Luckily, I am not allergic to dairy and felt pretty normal after the few bites I had. \\n\\nI am very upset that someone would do this... the owner is probably passing off real cheese as vegan to save money, since daiya is expensive, running around $6.00 a bag. \\n\\nI'm not even mad from a financial POV, what had happened was just disrespectful and confusing. This man is a total fraud. It is hard enough being vegan; not having many options to eat or  dine out, on top of being subject to ridicule from non-vegans...

The first time I placed an order with this company, I did it though Grub Hub(This is a nice application to order food and I have used it several times to order food from other restaurants) they didn't include my salad dressing. When I contacted them regarding this matter they apologize and said they would credit me next time. That's fine, its just salad dressing. \\n\\nSo I placed and order for wings, salad dressing, root beer and fries this weekend. I ordered it through the application Grub Hub like I did the previous time and when the guy arrives, I decided to have him wait while I checked my food. They provided me with the wrong size and type of salad and once again my salad dressing was missing. I contacted the store via my cell phone and it was on speaker phone with the driver standing next to me. The lady apologize and said the would give me a credit. I told him that I'm sick of the credit thing. This is ridiculous. She spoke with the driver the asked to speak back with me. I checked the ticket he was holding and it had the number #79 on it as did the two bags it brought. Some how someone put another person order in  my bag. The lady tried to blame it on the driver but I told her it wasn't his fault because both bags and the ticket with my order on it was marked 79 so who ever bagged the food which I'm sure it WASN'T the driver didn't check to make sure the #79 was on the correct bag. Why play the blame game and try to blame the driver when it was your fault. I understand people make mistakes but when its consistent and you act like you don't care and a credit will fix it then I have a problem with that. I gave the driver a tip because I knew it wasn't his fault. It was the lady on the phone who takes the orders. \\n\\nAfter the driver left she called me to say my card was declined (oh i forgot to tell you that the driver was looking for payment). I explained to her just like i did the driver that I paid through grub hub with my credit card and I only transferred enough to cover my order because i know how companies make mistakes and over and double charge you then have you wait a week to get a refund. The girl goes oh let me check your right, you did pay. I'm thinking to myself you know I paid because you called me to tell me you were out of root beer and what i wanted instead so I told you orange. I also asked for you to pleas make sure my french dressing was in the bag because you forgot it last time. She promised me it would be. You would think that they messed up last time that they would double check to make sure the order was right this time but NOOOO! I will never order from this place again.

A customer with a disability should NEVER be made to feel responsible for a service professionals laziness or lack of willingness to perform their job.  Nor should they have to take extreme efforts to receive the same level of service as non-disabled persons.\\n\\nThis was one of my favorite go-to places for palatable food and so as I have done for the better part of two years since moving here, I ordered online through my besty @Eat24 for delivery.  The \"delivery\" person called my cell to let me know that the food was outside.  I told him to knock on the door and someone would collect the food (a note that is included in the special instructions, btw).   The \"delivery\" person refused because I \"wasn\\'t in the house.\"\\n\\nI figured maybe he needed assurance so I explained that the order was already paid for and that there is someone in the house to collect the food from him, he need only to knock. I only ordered and paid for it as I have done multiple times in the past.  He again refused.  He said he calls because he \"expects you to answer the door while you are on the phone.\" \\n\\nI explained to the \"delivery\" person that the order was already paid for and it was noted that he would have to knock on the door to \"deliver\" it to the deaf person inside, not sit outside two houses down and beep the horn.   I also explained in this day and age of cell phones and the internet, his expectation was rather...archaic ....to say the very least.  His response was to leave, refusing to deliver the food until someone was standing in the door to greet him. \\n\\nSo I called the restaurant and explained to the manager that there was a deaf person receiving the order and the \"delivery\" person needed to knock to alert the service animals who\\'d in turn alert someone to answer the door ...not too complex for a delivery person - based on the fact that \"delivering\" food is part of his job description and all.  I complained to no avail, my daughter had to stand in the doorway waiting for the delivery person to eventually come back.  Truly a minor inconvenience  in the world today, especially after I contacted Eat24 for help and as usual their amazing customer service made this experience better than it was.  \\n\\nSo why am I writing this review with only one star when we really like the food and Eat24\\'s customer service response wins the day every time?  \\n\\nBecause when I called the restaurant to complain to the manager about the \"delivery\" person refusing to deliver, he pretty much said that it is not his \"delivery\" person\\'s responsibility to knock on the door and deliver the food \"just because someone is deaf, she should have someone there helping her.\"             0_o?   \\n\\nWell my good man, I can only agree with you that it is not your \"delivery\" person\\'s job to take the food to the door... and knock on it... \"just because a customer is deaf.\"  I mean it\\'s preposterous to think that anyone would make such a demand!  --Yet conversely, because he is a \"delivery\" person isn\\'t it his job to take the food to the door and knock on it... because that is the actual definition of DELIVERY?

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 -

Follow the formulas exactly as specified.\nDo not skip any primitive, even if it seems redundant or trivial.\n\nAnalyze Severe Allergy & Hygiene Safety (v12 - 25 Primitives).\n\n**CRITICAL EVALUATION CONTEXT**:\nThis task uses F2-score evaluation, which HEAVILY PENALIZES false negatives (missing high-risk restaurants).\nMissing a dangerous restaurant is 4\u00d7 WORSE than a false alarm.\nWhen uncertain, err on the side of reporting HIGHER risk.\n\n---\n\n**DEFINITIONS** (Intermediate Variables - compute these first, do NOT output):\n- `AvgStars`: Average star rating across ALL reviews\n- `OldestYear`: Year of the oldest review (extract from date field)\n- `FlaggedReviews`: Reviews containing ANY keyword from SEVERE_FLAGS, MILD_FLAGS, or POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `AvgAge_FlaggedReviews`: Average age in years of flagged reviews = Avg(2025 - ReviewYear for each flagged review)\n- `AvgStars_FlaggedReviews`: Average star rating across flagged reviews only\n- `TotalFlags`: Total count of SEVERE_FLAGS + MILD_FLAGS + POSITIVE_FLAGS\n- `RecentFlags`: Count of flags in reviews from 2024-2025\n- `OldFlags`: Count of flags in reviews before 2024\n- `BaseCuisineRisk`: 5.0 if restaurant categories include Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/Indian/African/Malaysian, else 0.0\n- `PreliminaryRisk`: Preliminary risk score before safety margin adjustment (see formula in L6)\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT PRIMITIVES** (You MUST calculate and output ALL 24 values below):\n\n**L1: Basic Metadata** (NON-SCORED - informational only)\n1. **TOTAL_REVIEWS**: Count of all reviews in the dataset\n\n**L2: Raw Extraction** (NON-SCORED - simple keyword counting)\n2. **SEVERE_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'reaction', 'hospital', 'nuts everywhere'\n3. **MILD_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'peanut oil', 'cross contamination', 'got sick'\n4. **POSITIVE_FLAGS**: Count reviews containing ANY of: 'accommodated', 'dedicated fryer', 'checked with chef', 'safe for allergy', 'allergy menu'\n5. **GOOD_HYGIENE**: Count keyword mentions across ALL reviews for: 'clean', 'spotless', 'immaculate', 'shining', 'sanitary'\n6. **BAD_HYGIENE**: Count keyword mentions across ALL reviews for: 'dirty', 'filthy', 'grime', 'sticky', 'gross', 'bugs', 'roach'\n\n**L3: Basic Aggregation** (SCORED)\n7. **REVIEW_DENSITY**: TOTAL_REVIEWS / 10.0\n8. **STAR_VARIANCE**: AvgStars -

I ordered this item as I have a dairy allergy and was excited to see a pizza that I didn\\'t have to ask to be modified in order to be dairy free. Both on their menu and on Uber eats it explicitly states that this pizza does not contain cheese.\\n\\nSo I get my pizza in a timely manner from Uber Eats, and when I open the box, what do I see? A pizza with ONLY cheese, peppers, and onions. There was not even sauce on the pizza and it did not contain any of the other toppings that were stated on the menu... I also received the actual A Tutti receipt and it stated the correct order, so I am very unsure how such a big mixup happened.\\n\\nI call the restaurant and they state that they will remake the pizza and have their delivery person deliver it to me as soon as possible. She stated that the driver will call me when he arrives at my apartment. So I wait for about 40 min and then TRY calling the restaurant back to ask what the ETA is. However, now their phone is not working. I had to call about 10 times for about 15 min before I can get through to the restaurant. When I finally get through, they state that they have been waiting for me to call back, because they were unable to get my address from Uber Eats. So I give it to them, and they state that it should be delivered soon.\\n\\nAnother 30 min go by and I have still not received my pizza or heard from the restaurant so I call back again, but of course it takes another 10 min of calling to get through. When I finally do they state that the driver is out making other deliveries, and if he was not back in 5 min that they would call the driver and then call me when the driver was on the way to my apartment. So after ANOTHER 30 min I try calling the restaurant, and \"surprisingly\" cannot  get through so I decide to get in my car and drive to the restaurant. As soon as I get there, I get a call from the delivery guy that he is at my apartment. I had not received a call from the restaurant stating he was on his way as promised.\\n\\nI go into the restaurant hoping to speak with the manager. I told the woman that had been answering the phone that I was expecting a refund seeing as it took all-in-all almost 3 hours to get the correct order delivered from the time I ordered it on Uber Eats until the time I got the pizza.

I had previously given A Tutti 3/5 based on a dinner service, and I recently attempted to give them another shot which revealed to me that I was mistaken in my 3-star judgment: let\\'s bump that down to 1-star and dive into the lambasting, shall we?\\n\\nThe entire point of the hospitality service is just that: to provide guests with a good experience and to make them feel welcome. This was the total opposite of my most recent - and definitely last experience - at A Tutti. I want so badly to have a good pasta restaurant near my house, so I decided to give them another shot, and boy did I regret it! My friend and I ordered a salad on focaccia, and pasta and meatballs. Pretty standard fare for an Italian place, right?\\n\\nMy food - the pasta and meatballs - came out of the kitchen pretty quickly. Notably absent was a salad, which seemed odd since normally Caesar salads are pretty quick to prepare, right? We waited about 10 minutes in the absence of the aforementioned salad - and our waiter - so I decided to take things into my own hands and beckoned over who appeared to be the owner (I believe his name is Paul). Upon learning that we were missing a salad (read: on focaccia), he retreated to the kitchen to presumably fix this problem. \\n\\nA few minutes later, the salad, devoid of focaccia - Paul in tow - sauntered over to our table. Our waiter joined Paul in delivering this incorrect dish to us with a smug expression on his face, and remarked, \"It\\'s all Paul\\'s fault!\"\\n\\nIn response to our evident displeasure, Paul asked, \"Was this supposed to be on focaccia?\" To our great dismay - and I can\\'t make this up - after we affirmed his query he responded with, \"Oh well! I\\'ll take it off the bill.\" (Said in reference to the additional charge of the focaccia NOT the whole salad.) What? He did not even offer to fix the dish that was wrongfully prepared. Just an \"Oh well.\"\\n\\nThis was such a backwards experience, all in the pursuit of truly mediocre pasta. The cacio e pepe I received this time was as awful as ever, the salty punch of pecorino was nowhere to be found and instead was replaced by an acrid, plasticky pre-ground black pepper flavor. \\n\\nI will absolutely not be giving them a third chance, and I most definitely hope this review saves some other poor souls from sharing a similar experience. Go in grace, friends.\\n\\n-- \\n\\nI have been dying to go to A Tutti for a while now because I\\'m very eager to find an Italian restaurant it\\'s great pasta near me. Unfortunately, I was let down by the pasta at A Tutti, but everything else was pretty good and I like the energy of the place, so I do want to go back and try again.\\n\\nService: Our server Sarah was great. She was super friendly and gave us good advice throughout the meal.\\n\\nAmbiance: I felt like I was in a little trattoria in Italy. Very authentic vibe with big band and swing music playing which further transported me out of Roxborough and into another time. We were immediately greeted warmly like family when we walked in, and I couldn\\'t stop smiling after that. \\n\\nFood: Definitely some stuff that can be worked on, here. I will start with my sad pasta, cacio e pepe, which was bland, gummy (overcooked & stuck together), and truly unpleasant to eat. It had none of the sharpness I would expect from a dish which is supposed to primarily consist of Pecorino Romano, and I really couldn\\'t even eat it. We also got the carbonara, which tasted good, but the egg was hugely scrambled (GIANT pieces of scrambled egg) and was a far cry from the luxurious, rich sauce you expect from this dish. I am not sure if we just got a bad night on the pasta front or if they need to tweak their recipes, but this was definitely a letdown.\\n\\nWe also got pizza, flatbread, tomato soup, and meatballs. All of this was awesome and tasted very authentic. The pizza was crispy - I love the dough - and had bright, tomatoey sauce with sweet, chewy cheese. The flatbread was made from the same dough and delivered crispy, herbal rosemary perfectly. The tomato soup was exquisite and was particularly tasty with the breads dipped into it! Finally, I was happy with the meatballs, which came out steaming and covered in tomato sauce.\\n\\nOverall, there were some misses this night, but I liked the good food and the atmosphere so much that I definitely want to return.

Yep, you guessed it. A salad and a Tre Carne pizza from A Tutti. He was utterly chuffed with himself, saying Michael Klein from The Inquirer had just reviewed the place so he knew the food must be good. I like Jake a lot so rather than criticize his choice or look a gift horse in the mouth, I made us a pitcher of sangria, told him he was a mensch, set the table and figured the second time\\'s the charm.\\n\\nNo. It\\'s certainly not. \\n\\nThe \"Caesar\" salad was just as bad as it was the first time I got it.

Not a scrap of pig or cow. It still came with the half burned basil scattered all over it like before, very little cheese and no black olives or meat of any kind to be found on top, in the box or up Jake\\'s sleeve. I asked Jake if he was okay with me crisping it up a bit. He said \\'do your thing,\\' so I discreetly grated some mozz, drizzled on some garlic oil, sliced up and scattered some pepperoni, dug out a few long hots, dressed the pathetic pie, put it on a pizza stone and gave it a blast in the oven. The fluffing helped. Just barely.  \\n\\nWe ate the pie because it was there, Jake had some polite forkfuls of the sad salad then moved it to my fridge, we gloried in the sangria and later in the bounty of frozen goodies I\\'d bought a few days before from Lil Pop Shop.\\n\\nA Tutti-you let me down again.', 'date': '2019-06-27 19:55:34', 'user': {'name': 'Warren', 'review_count': 167, 'yelping_since': '2006-03-12 01:04:23', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.26, 'fans': 67}}\n[R28] {'review_id': 'QwSFr3FwSvAT81_cy6vtcg', 'user_id': 'Z5dh2ITQAoXGMXQcWi46iw', 'business_id': 'x1CpCXik31TwTtMPMcrcug', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Absolutely amazing service and wonderful food.

All of this was awesome and tasted very authentic. The pizza was crispy - I love the dough - and had bright, tomatoey sauce with sweet, chewy cheese. The flatbread was made from the same dough and delivered crispy, herbal rosemary perfectly. The tomato soup was exquisite and was particularly tasty with the breads dipped into it! Finally, I was happy with the meatballs, which came out steaming and covered in tomato sauce.\\n\\nOverall, there were some misses this night, but I liked the good food and the atmosphere so much that I definitely want to return.

To start, I got the roasted tomato bisque and it was amazing! We then shared a focaccia and a Margherita pizza, the focaccia was great, and my boyfriend loves the pizza. For me the focaccia was great and the pizza was pretty good to. I liked the dough. The sauce had good flavor, just not enough sauce or mozz for my liking and the basil was blackened which I understand is a certain look, but I  l just like mine with fresh basil (an easy fix that I can just ask for next time). The pasta? The pasta was ok, we got the carbonara and cacio e pepe. They didn't have much flavor, but we're picky when it comes to pasta dishes. We forgot it was a BYOB, so when you go, don't forget the vino!\\n\\nSarah (our server) and she was great. Thank you Sarah! We also met the owner Paul, who shook our hands and asked if it was our first time. Very hospitable, thank you Paul and Sarah for making us feel welcome.

Hospitality here is fantastic. It's that down home, casual friendliness that I have not found anywhere other than Philly. The new owners turned what was a depressing space into a warm, nice looking environment. The prior business, also pizza, was abysmal with surroundings to match. A Tutti is clean and looks like a place where you wouldn't mind settling in and enjoying a meal. \\n\\nNot so nice or good was my Caesar salad which consisted of a large handful of not so fresh looking, yellow romaine, a few slivers of cheese, a lemon wedge (?!) and a dressing that tasted heavily of anchovy and salt. Where the hell were the herb croutons? Cracked black pepper? Sorry not sorry-this was a pathetic excuse for any kind of salad, never even mind that it wasn't what was described on the menu. 3 bites convinced me this was a waste of money and plate space and not worth taking home for later.\\n\\nThe Tre Carne pizza also saddened me. The puffy, browned crust hinted at what was going to be a toothsome, worth waiting for pie but damn-that crust lied to me. Bottom was blackened, bordering on burnt. The center of the pizza was soggily wet, limp and floppy. Careful excavation revealed no mozzarella at all, though again, that's what the menu promised. The pie was sloppily thrown together and who ever said that fresh basil should be roasted with the rest of the pie's ingredients? Uh uh. Bad move. The few basil leaves scattered on the pizza were crisp from the oven and tasted like overdone marijuana; bitter and brackish. The paper thin slices of mushroom fared equally badly in the oven, coming out leathery and flavorless, making me miss the earthy marriage of funghi to sweet tomato sauce. And the sauce? Umm-made me wish for shakers of garlic powder and oregano or even the ubiquitous dried chiles I used to rely on at the buck a slice joints to give it some taste. *sobs*\\n\\nI purposely chose to eat here instead of the chain-Santucci's-on Ridge but dammit-it will be my last visit to A Tutti. A shame, too, because if the food was even half as good as the friendliness I found here, I'd be a fat, happy, pizza gut gay boy in no time at all from patronizing this place.\", 'date': '2019-03-02 20:32:21', 'user': {'name': 'Warren', 'review_count': 167, 'yelping_since': '2006-03-12 01:04:23', 'elite': '', 'average_stars': 3.26, 'fans': 67}}\n[R40] {'review_id': 'uFW9c4y_JgNNDdC3pwDbrA', 'user_id': '7zKsEREhy91jMmi9rVOWRA', 'business_id': 'x1CpCXik31TwTtMPMcrcug', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'I live in the neighborhood and I am so glad to finally see a quality restaurant in this location.
