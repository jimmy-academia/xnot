I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018. If you\\'re still branded as a racist in America then I wish you luck, but you are not going to see any good come out of this.', 'date': '2018-06-13 03:16:17', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 44, 'average_stars': 3.11, 'yelping_since': '2014-12-20 19:50:42'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'mOGSlH_urFGtKpShv13vRw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'evxNxzLit333M7NhaI6ShA', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Overall, I thought the food was great but there were a few things that kept me from giving a higher rating. First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3. The two? three? hostesses looked really confused, but then told us they were going to seat us upstairs in a few minutes. My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave. We left enough money to cover the $8.90 + tax for the Macedonia. We never even saw the bill. \\n\\nWhat confuses me is that the creme brulee (one of the two desserts we never got), were already made and on display.

Yelpers, this sinful combination, this dynamic duo will make you feel like you are having an affair. 1 word, 3 syllables. De-lic-ious... Delicious. \\n*Insalata Pera ~ For a salad this larger than life dish of greens with fruits was on point. A fresh crisp succulent pear that just did numbers to ones taste buds, with the goat cheese mixed in there making me rethink how a salad should always taste.  \\n                                                   ~Dessert~ \\n*Brioche con Gelato ~ This dessert is actually a gelato sandwich, with your choice of 2 scoops of gelato. I went with a Bacio gelato and an Amaretto gelato, being held nicely in a toasted brioche bun. To be honest this was ok, the brioche seemed a little too dry, and the gelato not so creamy. This is not a slam on Gran Caffe, with everything that have to offer, but it seemed a little off to me. I will say this though, their dessert menu looks amazing, with endless options. \\n \\nUnique dishes that will have your taste buds going into full tilt mode along with their weekly tasting menu. Their tasting menu is designed to bring you through different regions of Italy, experiencing the dishes from that region. If that doesn\\'t raise an eyebrow you should checkout their happy hour menu, and specials. I feel Gran Caffe L\\'Aquilla is an establishment that needs to be a part of your rotation. The last few times I\\'ve been here the staff has always made sure I, or we have been fully accommodated. Hopefully you\\'re seated in Corina or Anastaysia area, but if not, don\\'t fret their staff will make sure you\\'ll have the very best dining experience.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that\\'s all.\\n\\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week.

My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative.

I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops.

Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

I forgive you Yelp and I\\'m not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.

The food choices are minimal, but they offer a selection of local baked goods. I finally tried an everything bagel. Although a little doughy (unsure who the purveyor was), it was toasted perfectly and topped with a bean-free sweet potato hummus... that wasn't even on the menu yet. The barista, who always greets me with a warm welcome, was kind enough to let me try it out since I ordered the Sabra hummus anyway. Pro-tip: always go for the house-made stuff! Anyway, love this place. Always leaves me satisfied.

The drink itself had a strong bite to it initially, but further down, the taste became more sweet, however, not in an unpleasant, artificial way.  It was reminiscent of something fruity. That sweetness is something that seems original to Square One's espresso.

I wanted to try the local, Lancaster roasted coffee, so she recommended, and offered a sample of the special drip coffee they were serving. It was excellent; very mellow, low acidity, and slightly nutty. However, I wanted to try one of the more premium pour-overs and decided on the single-origin, Colombia. It was so easy to drink, very balanced, fruity and nutty at the same time and really smooth.\\n\\nMy only qualm (hence the 4 star review) was that the coffee was served in a relatively thin, glass carafe. I wanted to leisurely sip and enjoy the coffee, not rush in fear that it'd be cold soon. Unfortunately, by the last pour, it was quite cold and unenjoyable. The first three mugfuls were great, though. For a $6 specialty pour-over, I just hoped to enjoy every last drop. \\n\\nWhen I return to visit Philly, I'll definitely come back to Square One Coffee and will recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to caffeinate and chill.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

And not only that, a place FILLED with so many types of board games and helpful people to teach you how to play these board games! I was here with a group of 12 this past Sunday, and it's often a challenge to find a game that is suitable for a group this size. The shelves are stocked with so many games categorized by type of game, difficulty level, and group size. We ended up playing two games, Deception and Hive Minds, and it was one of the best afternoons I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nYou pay a flat rate of $5.00 to use the space and play the games, which, I think is a bargain, considering they have to replenish the games often and keep them pristine.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left.

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would\\'ve liked to end the evening. \\n\\nOverall: Great concept, and I\\'ll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee.

Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn\\'t say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \\n\\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice.

We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple.

As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing.

Can\\'t be seated if the whole party isn\\'t there and they give your reservation up if you\\'re not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late.

This isn\\'t some five star restaurant so I don\\'t see why this is all necessary. \\n\\nOur board game expert person introduced himself at the beginning and explained how it works and that he can help us choose stuff and play the games if needed.

That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \\n\\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn\\'t hard to make but literally took 30min to come out.

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always. Though crowded, the hostess had us seated in less than 5 minutes when she saw two chairs available and made a very obvious effort to get us settled ASAP. Yesss!
