I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018. If you\\'re still branded as a racist in America then I wish you luck, but you are not going to see any good come out of this.', 'date': '2018-06-13 03:16:17', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 44, 'average_stars': 3.11, 'yelping_since': '2014-12-20 19:50:42'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'mOGSlH_urFGtKpShv13vRw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'evxNxzLit333M7NhaI6ShA', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Overall, I thought the food was great but there were a few things that kept me from giving a higher rating. First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3. The two? three? hostesses looked really confused, but then told us they were going to seat us upstairs in a few minutes. My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave. We left enough money to cover the $8.90 + tax for the Macedonia. We never even saw the bill. \\n\\nWhat confuses me is that the creme brulee (one of the two desserts we never got), were already made and on display.

Yelpers, this sinful combination, this dynamic duo will make you feel like you are having an affair. 1 word, 3 syllables. De-lic-ious... Delicious. \\n*Insalata Pera ~ For a salad this larger than life dish of greens with fruits was on point. A fresh crisp succulent pear that just did numbers to ones taste buds, with the goat cheese mixed in there making me rethink how a salad should always taste.  \\n                                                   ~Dessert~ \\n*Brioche con Gelato ~ This dessert is actually a gelato sandwich, with your choice of 2 scoops of gelato. I went with a Bacio gelato and an Amaretto gelato, being held nicely in a toasted brioche bun. To be honest this was ok, the brioche seemed a little too dry, and the gelato not so creamy. This is not a slam on Gran Caffe, with everything that have to offer, but it seemed a little off to me. I will say this though, their dessert menu looks amazing, with endless options. \\n \\nUnique dishes that will have your taste buds going into full tilt mode along with their weekly tasting menu. Their tasting menu is designed to bring you through different regions of Italy, experiencing the dishes from that region. If that doesn\\'t raise an eyebrow you should checkout their happy hour menu, and specials. I feel Gran Caffe L\\'Aquilla is an establishment that needs to be a part of your rotation. The last few times I\\'ve been here the staff has always made sure I, or we have been fully accommodated. Hopefully you\\'re seated in Corina or Anastaysia area, but if not, don\\'t fret their staff will make sure you\\'ll have the very best dining experience.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that\\'s all.\\n\\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week.

My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative.

I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops.

Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers? Perhaps. For Philadelphia regulars though? I doubt it.

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.  The only time we saw the server was the obligatory check in on us after the meal was delivered and to bring the check.\\n\\nWe get it... The restaurant closes, you want to clean the tables and get everything cleaned up, but come on.\\n\\nAll in all, the experience was less than ideal and sadly, didn\\'t experience the \"amazing\" experience that others did.', 'date': '2021-11-15 04:15:58', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 360, 'average_stars': 3.81, 'yelping_since': '2011-07-09 22:36:27'}}\n[R19] {'review_id': 'o2Wv2ygnuF4lMJqlMlH4VA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'I toyed with the idea of a 2 star review because Gran Caffe is a very spacious and impeccably clean restaurant in a nice area of Philly with very good service but in good conscious I couldn\\'t give them any more than 1 star for the food they subjected us to. Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

I forgive you Yelp and I\\'m not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.  And by greet I mean, come over and ask if we were ready to order when we didn\\'t even have menus yet.  He didn\\'t introduce himself, mention any specials or crack a smile.

I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?!

The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things.

The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves.

The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3.

Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying.

We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience! If you\\'re looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\\n\\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I\\'ve experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5\\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I\\'ve had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \\n\\nFor dessert, I couldn\\'t decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I\\'m very grateful.\\n\\nFOOD: 4/5\\nThe only reason why I\\'d give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn\\'t mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\\n\\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however.

The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.

I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here.

Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for.

First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious.

A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3.

Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying.

We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience! If you\\'re looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\\n\\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I\\'ve experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5\\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I\\'ve had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \\n\\nFor dessert, I couldn\\'t decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I\\'m very grateful.\\n\\nFOOD: 4/5\\nThe only reason why I\\'d give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn\\'t mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\\n\\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for.

I forgive you Yelp and I\\'m not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.  And by greet I mean, come over and ask if we were ready to order when we didn\\'t even have menus yet.  He didn\\'t introduce himself, mention any specials or crack a smile.

I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3. The two? three? hostesses looked really confused, but then told us they were going to seat us upstairs in a few minutes. My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave. We left enough money to cover the $8.90 + tax for the Macedonia.

I thought those things should have been settled in the kitchen and made known to the servers.\\nThe chef had adulterated the oysters with flavors and something sweet so that it taste like anything but oysters. Because I said I expected oysters, the owner sent up another five.  Yes, they were plain with adulterated cocktail sauce but were not the taste of great Blue Points.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for?

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server.

The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience! If you\\'re looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\\n\\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I\\'ve experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5\\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I\\'ve had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \\n\\nFor dessert, I couldn\\'t decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I\\'m very grateful.\\n\\nFOOD: 4/5\\nThe only reason why I\\'d give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn\\'t mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\\n\\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?!

The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night.

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3.

Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that\\'s all.\\n\\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions. That\\'s why it seemed inexpensive. But we stay.\\n\\nThe waiter: \"Any questions?\"\\nWife: \"Yes -- between the (listed entree), the (listed entree), and the (listed entree)...\"  [looks at waiter]\\nWaiter:  \"What\\'s the question?\"\\n\\n(Strike one.)\\n\\nWife:  \"Which is your favorite?\"\\nWaiter then seems to struggle with recommendations.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience!

When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us!

Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops.

Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks.

As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably.

Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

I forgive you Yelp and I\\'m not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip.

Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week.

The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience! If you\\'re looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\\n\\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I\\'ve experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5\\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I\\'ve had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \\n\\nFor dessert, I couldn\\'t decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I\\'m very grateful.\\n\\nFOOD: 4/5\\nThe only reason why I\\'d give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn\\'t mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\\n\\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers? Perhaps. For Philadelphia regulars though? I doubt it.

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.  The only time we saw the server was the obligatory check in on us after the meal was delivered and to bring the check.\\n\\nWe get it...

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?! I'm already planning my next meal and brunch too!\", 'date': '2016-01-18 04:03:23', 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 102, 'average_stars': 4.07, 'yelping_since': '2013-09-08 19:19:50'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'exVZxIzf-RS0d_zETJJ0KA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'WT36RE4WkUIaEbLDjkPB3g', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'Almost overwhelming menu as everything you\\'d ever want from Italy is here...but when it\\'s delivered to your table, it\\'s nothing you\\'d ever want to eat.\\n\\nWhile looking over the menu, we ordered two mixed drinks; Negroni and an Aperol Spritz.  The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things. I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \\nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018.

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3.

My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

This is not a slam on Gran Caffe, with everything that have to offer, but it seemed a little off to me. I will say this though, their dessert menu looks amazing, with endless options. \\n \\nUnique dishes that will have your taste buds going into full tilt mode along with their weekly tasting menu. Their tasting menu is designed to bring you through different regions of Italy, experiencing the dishes from that region. If that doesn\\'t raise an eyebrow you should checkout their happy hour menu, and specials. I feel Gran Caffe L\\'Aquilla is an establishment that needs to be a part of your rotation. The last few times I\\'ve been here the staff has always made sure I, or we have been fully accommodated. Hopefully you\\'re seated in Corina or Anastaysia area, but if not, don\\'t fret their staff will make sure you\\'ll have the very best dining experience.

I don't want to deal with crowds or menus that are easier on the chefs to mass produce and push out.  Not this place though.  They offer such a wide variety of their menu and they change it up every week with a special visit to Italian Cities.  For Valentine's day, we were treated to a trip in Verona, home of Romeo and Juliet.  It's so fitting too, because Romeo and Juliet plays such a vital part in my marriage.  My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that\\'s all.\\n\\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\\n\\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\\n\\nTo sum it up, you really can\\'t go wrong with Caffe Gran L\\'Aquila, no matter what you\\'re looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week.

The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative.

Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops.

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I\\'ve eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \\n\\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible.

I forgive you Yelp and I\\'m not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.

I don\\'t remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there\\'s more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \\n\\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it\\'s the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won\\'t go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.

I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \\n\\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \\n\\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \\n\\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \\n\\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \\n\\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?!

The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\\n\\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn\\'t fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\\n\\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\\n\\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\\n\\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno\\'s down the street and get a full cheese serving if you\\'re after a cheese plate.\\n\\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they\\'re just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\\n\\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli\\'s were also overcooked and I\\'d swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\\n\\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they\\'re famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\\n\\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.', 'date': '2015-01-07 16:50:51', 'useful': 12, 'funny': 4, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 439, 'average_stars': 3.65, 'yelping_since': '2012-07-04 13:19:17'}}\n[R3] {'review_id': 'N-stexeAl5uo8raGZU6JVw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': '1LvjQ6heZ3RPBK8xGVDWSQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"I have to start by saying that other than a big love of all things Italian and the fact that I stalked this place as it was being built, and hope it remains successful, I hold no stake or stock in the restaurant even though my raving review will make you think someone paid me to say these things.

The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\\n\\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I\\'m hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\\n\\nWe tell her we\\'re waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I\\'m baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\\n\\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it\\'s apparently so beneath her. \\n\\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \\n\\nIts 2018. If you\\'re still branded as a racist in America then I wish you luck, but you are not going to see any good come out of this.', 'date': '2018-06-13 03:16:17', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 44, 'average_stars': 3.11, 'yelping_since': '2014-12-20 19:50:42'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'mOGSlH_urFGtKpShv13vRw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'evxNxzLit333M7NhaI6ShA', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Overall, I thought the food was great but there were a few things that kept me from giving a higher rating. First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \\nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \\nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.\", 'date': '2016-01-10 21:13:14', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 72, 'average_stars': 3.42, 'yelping_since': '2015-05-10 03:28:48'}}\n[R6] {'review_id': 'vXprX6WKDAo5xHtFZGCFPg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'fR5x6zfrcWuOV74fx5oIMA', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"We walked in and requested a table for 3.

Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\\n\\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\\n\\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

My wife and I both know that if we think the other one is dead, to not drink poison and just wait it out...  Most likely one of us is just sleeping...  No need to make a tragedy out of laziness...  \\n\\nAnyways, we were greeted right away and although we were about twenty minutes early for our reservation, we were promptly seated upstairs.  Our waitress introduced herself and explained the menu.  We really needed a game plan on how to maximize our happiness and we figured out the best way to do that.  I started off with the Bigoli Al Rosemarino.  Bigoli pasta with a duck ragu, with some rosemary and ricotta gastronomic gelato mixed in.  SERIOUSLY...  Savory gelato in the shape of a heart, that I was supposed to break up and mix into my pasta.  It added a nice touch and well worth it.  My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \\n\\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \\n\\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \\n\\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I\\'ve just discovered) ordering delivery!\\n\\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You\\'ll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn\\'t totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L\\'Aquila apart.\\n\\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that\\'s in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini\\'s Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I\\'d been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there\\'s a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\\n\\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don\\'t think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it\\'s definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y\\'all who don\\'t like overly sweet desserts.\\n\\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don\\'t have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it\\'s probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn\\'t cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won\\'t get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don\\'t do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn\\'t learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \\n\\nUpon arrival our table wasn\\'t ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren\\'t able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren\\'t near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I\\'m glad we stayed...\\n\\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it\\'s supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I\\'m a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \\n\\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I\\'m no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \\n\\nNow as you may know, I\\'m not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There\\'s something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \\n\\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \\n\\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn\\'t have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \\n\\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L\\'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.', 'date': '2016-06-16 16:59:42', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 1402, 'average_stars': 3.78, 'yelping_since': '2010-04-19 19:23:27'}}\n[R14] {'review_id': 'hkoSbLeTx7ilyNAUkxI6eg', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'Obp8LRY_MRwUIqTPDbp6Zw', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': \"Restaurant week review\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for wait time for food\\n4 stars for waiter\\n\\nAmbience: I came with a friend for indoor dining at 5PM over the weekend for Restaurant Week. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\\n\\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\\n\\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\\n\\nFood: \\nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\\n\\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \\nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\\n\\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \\nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\\n\\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\\n\\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\\n\\nFourth course: \\nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\\n\\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly\", 'date': '2021-09-20 23:43:11', 'useful': 3, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 218, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2018-07-14 20:47:36'}}\n[R15] {'review_id': 'gzzhNVhQxL1pN3KM5VpniA', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"Tonight was my second time here, and after having experienced drinks, food and service, I'm ready to write a review- and its a great one!\\nBoth of my visits to Gran Caffe l'Aquila were work-related (just another reason I love my job). The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.\", 'date': '2021-12-15 02:19:20', 'useful': 7, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 4, 'user': {'review_count': 286, 'average_stars': 3.99, 'yelping_since': '2008-02-27 22:39:48'}}\n[R16] {'review_id': 'IndMG4fKejhGPsQzE1uTQw', 'business_id': '-cEFKAznWmI0cledNOIQ7w', 'user_id': 'LjiUcIjdqBbk9MMDrAPXOw', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': 'I came here for restaurant week with a close friend and it was such a memorable experience! If you\\'re looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\\n\\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I\\'ve experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won\\'t regret it!\\n\\nSERVICE: 5/5\\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn\\'t guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I\\'ve had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \\n\\nFor dessert, I couldn\\'t decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I\\'m very grateful.\\n\\nFOOD: 4/5\\nThe only reason why I\\'d give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don\\'t get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I\\'d give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here\\'s a run-down of my impression:\\n\\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I\\'ve had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE:\\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I\\'m lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \\n\\nSECOND COURSE:\\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\\n\\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE:\\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven\\'t tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I\\'ve tried tasted like this one.\\n\\nDESSERT\\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn\\'t mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\\n\\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can\\'t say I\\'m completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\\n\\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn\\'t noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison\\'s sake, in 2016 and \\'17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\\n\\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\\n\\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\\n\\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\\n\\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\\n\\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn\\'t going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40\\'s) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you\\'d feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn\\'t a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn\\'t going to work.\\n\\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn\\'t write home about it and I wouldn\\'t come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn\\'t have that experience.  \\n\\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there\\'d be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn\\'t enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn\\'t even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \\n\\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\\n\\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn\\'t taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.  One of the busboys came by to clean the table and when we explained we were still eating, he stood there waiting for our friend to finish her last few bites of gelato.  We explained we \"were still eating\" and he took a few empty plates and left, only to come back a few minutes later to get the last gelato dish.\\n\\nNo one came back out to refill our water glasses.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There\\'s a good chance if you\\'re just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn\\'t carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we\\'ve ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It\\'s also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \\n\\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn\\'t finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \\n\\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn\\'t recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I\\'ve ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I\\'ve had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don\\'t hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I\\'ve ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \\n\\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife\\'s dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn\\'t even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef\\'s truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn\\'t actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn\\'t stand. The ravioli\\'s filling wasn\\'t meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \\n\\nI\\'ve never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp\\'s overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don\\'t know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\\n\\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I\\'d just respond here. First of all I\\'ve only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant\\'s I\\'ve written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I\\'ve written 5 star reviews for.

The prices are extremely competitive. $2.50 for an iced coffee or hot coffee. It's rare that you find the two with a similar price tag. The food choices are minimal, but they offer a selection of local baked goods. I finally tried an everything bagel.

That sweetness is something that seems original to Square One's espresso.  In my experience, aftertastes in cappuccinos are usually bland (slightly milky), or sour.  \\n\\nI liked the product here and my experience definitely verged on five stars.  I think there are still kinks to work out.  The space is big, but with limited seating, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences.  There wasn't a buzz yet, but I'm sure there will be as time passes.

We noticed that people who ordered after us were getting all of their orders. Finally my bf checked in on it and the guy completely forgot... That's cool. -_- So then of course he rushed making the drinks.  Another reason why I like sitting inside to enjoy my drink is bc as a stereotypical asian girl, I like to eat with my eyeballs and take pictures.  However, instead of getting my latte in a mug with some nice frothy art, it was thrown into a to go cup, plain as ever.  Sighs.\\n\\nI would've at least been happy if the latte were well made.

I wanted to try the local, Lancaster roasted coffee, so she recommended, and offered a sample of the special drip coffee they were serving. It was excellent; very mellow, low acidity, and slightly nutty. However, I wanted to try one of the more premium pour-overs and decided on the single-origin, Colombia. It was so easy to drink, very balanced, fruity and nutty at the same time and really smooth.\\n\\nMy only qualm (hence the 4 star review) was that the coffee was served in a relatively thin, glass carafe. I wanted to leisurely sip and enjoy the coffee, not rush in fear that it'd be cold soon. Unfortunately, by the last pour, it was quite cold and unenjoyable. The first three mugfuls were great, though. For a $6 specialty pour-over, I just hoped to enjoy every last drop. \\n\\nWhen I return to visit Philly, I'll definitely come back to Square One Coffee and will recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to caffeinate and chill.

The two quiet staffers were nice and answered our few questions, pointing out their few baked goods (not made on premises, but a local bakery nonetheless). We both went with their cold brew, which was delicious and smooth (should've asked for less ice though).

Later, I went back and asked for a a different spread and they said no because they all had various prices. Well- there are no prices listed for anything on the food menu, so I had no idea. The biggest pitfall here, though, is that the \"large\" size iced drink is about 16 oz - roughly the size of a grande at Starbucks for reference. And not filled all the way up. I can only imagine what a small is... there are so many great coffee shops in the area so I think I will stick to those and skip this place in the future.', 'date': '2019-08-20 13:29:35', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 54, 'average_stars': 4.0, 'yelping_since': '2014-05-27 12:27:25'}}\n[R18] {'review_id': 'yVEL_slJ4S6a2hVmPadIVQ', 'business_id': '0Z8ps_OfcR9eJaV2JtxigA', 'user_id': 'WuxGYrNy3eKo0zo_mtn-4Q', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': \"I really wanted to like this place.

I wanted to try the local, Lancaster roasted coffee, so she recommended, and offered a sample of the special drip coffee they were serving. It was excellent; very mellow, low acidity, and slightly nutty. However, I wanted to try one of the more premium pour-overs and decided on the single-origin, Colombia. It was so easy to drink, very balanced, fruity and nutty at the same time and really smooth.\\n\\nMy only qualm (hence the 4 star review) was that the coffee was served in a relatively thin, glass carafe. I wanted to leisurely sip and enjoy the coffee, not rush in fear that it'd be cold soon. Unfortunately, by the last pour, it was quite cold and unenjoyable. The first three mugfuls were great, though. For a $6 specialty pour-over, I just hoped to enjoy every last drop. \\n\\nWhen I return to visit Philly, I'll definitely come back to Square One Coffee and will recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to caffeinate and chill.

I had to cross the street and cross back just to get there (to avoid my clothes smelling like hot garbage). Dudes were in there with laptops, so I'm guessing they have wi-fi. Anyway, the clean, mod and sleek interior was cool, seating arraigned around the perimeter of the store and the smell was heavenly. I don't know the lay of the land yet, so I  kept it simple and ordered a medium cup of coffee. The girl at the counter was very helpful and greeted me warmly (#win) and served up my cup lickity split. The 'fixin's' bar was around the other side of the island. they only had 1/2 and 1/2 , no skim milk, whole milk or soy (#nonwin) out for use. They had the blue and yellow stuff as well as that brown sugar and white sugar. No stevia (yet - fingers crossed) to speak of. There is really only room for 1 person at a time to doctor up their drinks with a tiny trash hole on the left side.  \\n\\nAll in all, not bad. A medium coffee is $2.25 (*bucks prices) They have $1 refills (at least that's what I thought I read), some pastries but nothing appetizing (It's still early, I know). I'll visit again for sure, but I'll make sure the block is trash truck free and the gang isn't inhabiting.

We both went with their cold brew, which was delicious and smooth (should've asked for less ice though).

In my experience, aftertastes in cappuccinos are usually bland (slightly milky), or sour.  \\n\\nI liked the product here and my experience definitely verged on five stars.  I think there are still kinks to work out.  The space is big, but with limited seating, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences.  There wasn't a buzz yet, but I'm sure there will be as time passes.

We noticed that people who ordered after us were getting all of their orders. Finally my bf checked in on it and the guy completely forgot... That's cool. -_- So then of course he rushed making the drinks.  Another reason why I like sitting inside to enjoy my drink is bc as a stereotypical asian girl, I like to eat with my eyeballs and take pictures.  However, instead of getting my latte in a mug with some nice frothy art, it was thrown into a to go cup, plain as ever.  Sighs.\\n\\nI would've at least been happy if the latte were well made.

I wanted to try the local, Lancaster roasted coffee, so she recommended, and offered a sample of the special drip coffee they were serving. It was excellent; very mellow, low acidity, and slightly nutty. However, I wanted to try one of the more premium pour-overs and decided on the single-origin, Colombia. It was so easy to drink, very balanced, fruity and nutty at the same time and really smooth.\\n\\nMy only qualm (hence the 4 star review) was that the coffee was served in a relatively thin, glass carafe. I wanted to leisurely sip and enjoy the coffee, not rush in fear that it'd be cold soon. Unfortunately, by the last pour, it was quite cold and unenjoyable. The first three mugfuls were great, though. For a $6 specialty pour-over, I just hoped to enjoy every last drop. \\n\\nWhen I return to visit Philly, I'll definitely come back to Square One Coffee and will recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to caffeinate and chill.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

And not only that, a place FILLED with so many types of board games and helpful people to teach you how to play these board games! I was here with a group of 12 this past Sunday, and it's often a challenge to find a game that is suitable for a group this size. The shelves are stocked with so many games categorized by type of game, difficulty level, and group size. We ended up playing two games, Deception and Hive Minds, and it was one of the best afternoons I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nYou pay a flat rate of $5.00 to use the space and play the games, which, I think is a bargain, considering they have to replenish the games often and keep them pristine.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left. Other than the fact that the hostess was rude and unprofessional , I would recommend coming here for the wide selections of games.', 'date': '2019-06-01 21:14:32', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 3.5, 'yelping_since': '2014-09-10 00:48:23'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'YcYiRGKOjVN9bqa2wQMDGw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'w3pxYLICTV3R5_b9BE-MbQ', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Games: So many games!

But, they tax that $7 to make it about $7.50, then add it to your food/drink bill and expect you to tip on it? The food and drink are okay, but WAY overpriced.

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would\\'ve liked to end the evening. \\n\\nOverall: Great concept, and I\\'ll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee. But I want to be clear that it was not exorbitant - please, visit this place. It's worth it. Just don't go in with the expectation that it's on the frugal way to spend a night out. Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn\\'t say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \\n\\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice. Even when one of our party mentioned an example of a game she\\'d played before and asked if there was anything similar we never got a straight answer, so we kind of gave up and she picked something she had played before to start us off. \\n\\nIf you\\'re like me and haven\\'t played many board games, I would do some research beforehand so you know what to grab when you get there.

Upon walking in, the place had a very welcoming vibe- warm yet spacey, a wall chopped full of games, and at that moment a couple of large parties enjoying brunch and playing board games. We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \\n\\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner\\'s chicken and waffles was cold and bland. Yet again, had to call over another person to get it remade. \\n\\nI really believe the place has potential! To be around a year and a half already it\\'s clearly doing something right.

They didn\\'t take reservations for groups under 12, which is understandable since it seems like a small place. When we arrived, one person from our party was going to be 30 mins late. They said they couldnt seat us until we were all there. We asked if we could just have a table and add a chair later, they said no. We asked if we could sit at the communal table for now and just move to a table when we were all there. The WOC behind the counter spun her head around and rudely said \"No! I\\'ll tell you right now, that\\'s not happening.\" Apparently if we want to switch tables, we need to close out our checks and then open a new tab. Okay, whatever. We sit at the communal table which was pretty empty and hoped the empty seat beside us stays empty. The seating policies are kind of ridiculous.\\n\\nAnyway, we take our seats and ordered food and drinks. Nothing we ordered was remotely good. The hot chocolate tasted like the powdered box kind you get for $1 and it was literally cold. I decided to pick something else. The peach iced tea was tarte and not great. The mac and cheese and pizza were bland and way overpriced.\\n\\nThe game selection is why this didn\\'t get zero stars. They have a huge variety and we had a lot of fun! However, the staff that are supposed to teach you the games arent very knowledgeable of the games and one even taught us the rules wrong. We didn\\'t get the full experience because we\\'d been playing incorrectly. Luckily after a bit of frustration, we read the rules ourselves and figured out the correct way.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, they messed up the calculations.

Can\\'t be seated if the whole party isn\\'t there and they give your reservation up if you\\'re not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late. Since it was late in the evening they let them sit down without me there. This isn\\'t some five star restaurant so I don\\'t see why this is all necessary. \\n\\nOur board game expert person introduced himself at the beginning and explained how it works and that he can help us choose stuff and play the games if needed. All well and good except he never came back around to check on us or see if we needed help or anything. The game selection is VAST which is great if you\\'re into board games. That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \\n\\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn\\'t hard to make but literally took 30min to come out. He also never came by to clear used cups and dishes, and having extra table space when playing a board game seems reasonable...To top it all off, tip was included  so our server made away with a decent tip even though he more or less ignored us and did everything wrong the whole night. \\n\\nThe one nice thing was that they didn\\'t kick us out after the 2.5 hr listed time limit. It was nearing closing time and the place was clearing out so it just made sense to let us sit there till midnight. \\n\\nGreat concept, love the collection of board games, but the price seems a bit much, the drinks are hit or miss (mostly miss) and the service (both our server and the Game Master Person) was terrible.

For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why.

We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

And not only that, a place FILLED with so many types of board games and helpful people to teach you how to play these board games! I was here with a group of 12 this past Sunday, and it's often a challenge to find a game that is suitable for a group this size. The shelves are stocked with so many games categorized by type of game, difficulty level, and group size. We ended up playing two games, Deception and Hive Minds, and it was one of the best afternoons I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nYou pay a flat rate of $5.00 to use the space and play the games, which, I think is a bargain, considering they have to replenish the games often and keep them pristine. Here's looking at you, people with Cheeto fingers. During off-peak hours, you are welcome to stay until closing, and then during peak days/hours, the $5.00 is good for 2 1/2 hours, and you are free to replenish.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left. Other than the fact that the hostess was rude and unprofessional , I would recommend coming here for the wide selections of games.', 'date': '2019-06-01 21:14:32', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 3.5, 'yelping_since': '2014-09-10 00:48:23'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'YcYiRGKOjVN9bqa2wQMDGw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'w3pxYLICTV3R5_b9BE-MbQ', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Games: So many games! The library is impressive, and it\\'s nice to have access to so many new games to try. \\n\\nPrices:  I understand the $7 sitting fee, as it has to account for people who don\\'t order anything. But, they tax that $7 to make it about $7.50, then add it to your food/drink bill and expect you to tip on it? The food and drink are okay, but WAY overpriced. French bread pizza looks like it was made in a Tiny Kitchen. It would be nice if they reduced the price of menu items, or have something like \"order $15/20 worth of food and drink, and you don\\'t have to pay a sitting fee\". \\n\\nService: The game tenders (shout out to Joel) were super patient and knowledgeable when we asked for help with new games!! The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would\\'ve liked to end the evening. \\n\\nOverall: Great concept, and I\\'ll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee. But I want to be clear that it was not exorbitant - please, visit this place. It's worth it. Just don't go in with the expectation that it's on the frugal way to spend a night out. Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games? If the owner lets me set up a bedroom so I can live there, I look forward to everyone coming over to my new house and playing games!

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn\\'t say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \\n\\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice. Even when one of our party mentioned an example of a game she\\'d played before and asked if there was anything similar we never got a straight answer, so we kind of gave up and she picked something she had played before to start us off. \\n\\nIf you\\'re like me and haven\\'t played many board games, I would do some research beforehand so you know what to grab when you get there.

Upon walking in, the place had a very welcoming vibe- warm yet spacey, a wall chopped full of games, and at that moment a couple of large parties enjoying brunch and playing board games. We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \\n\\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner\\'s chicken and waffles was cold and bland. Yet again, had to call over another person to get it remade. \\n\\nI really believe the place has potential! To be around a year and a half already it\\'s clearly doing something right.

We asked if we could sit at the communal table for now and just move to a table when we were all there. The WOC behind the counter spun her head around and rudely said \"No!

Can\\'t be seated if the whole party isn\\'t there and they give your reservation up if you\\'re not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late.

That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \\n\\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each.

The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left.

The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does.

The games are color coded to let you know their level of difficulty, whether or not they are good for two players, and if it is a \"gateway game\" to a genre of games. \\n\\nThirsty Dice also has a good selection of food and beverages (including beer, wine, game-inspired cocktails, and boozy milkshakes). We tried the spicy mix (think of a spicy Chex Mix, but with Goldfish and pretzels) and it was good, but kind of small, but given the $3 price tag, you can\\'t ask for much more. We also tried the classic flatbread pizza. The pizza was amazing, but a lot smaller than I was anticipating. It costs $7 so I probably won\\'t get it again. A few people around me had the mac and cheese and it looks incredible, so I will definitely try that the next time I swing by. \\n\\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time at Thirsty Dice.

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left.

They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island.

Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table.

We tried the spicy mix (think of a spicy Chex Mix, but with Goldfish and pretzels) and it was good, but kind of small, but given the $3 price tag, you can\\'t ask for much more. We also tried the classic flatbread pizza. The pizza was amazing, but a lot smaller than I was anticipating. It costs $7 so I probably won\\'t get it again.

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth.

We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table.

They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee. But I want to be clear that it was not exorbitant - please, visit this place. It's worth it. Just don't go in with the expectation that it's on the frugal way to spend a night out. Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar.

We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it.

It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice.

We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server.

Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner\\'s chicken and waffles was cold and bland.

We asked if we could sit at the communal table for now and just move to a table when we were all there. The WOC behind the counter spun her head around and rudely said \"No! I\\'ll tell you right now, that\\'s not happening.\" Apparently if we want to switch tables, we need to close out our checks and then open a new tab. Okay, whatever.

Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn\\'t hard to make but literally took 30min to come out.

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good. There were also some drinks and milkshakes that we didn't get to taste, but looked amazing.

It's easy enough to go out and get a few drinks, but why not have some fun that is stiumulating? You know, actually use a few brain cells rather than kill them? \\n\\nEnter the Thirsty Dice!\\n\\nI am not sure how I came across this bar, but I found it online a few days before my most recent trip to Philly and made a note that I WAS going to go. Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always. Though crowded, the hostess had us seated in less than 5 minutes when she saw two chairs available and made a very obvious effort to get us settled ASAP. Yesss!

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left. Other than the fact that the hostess was rude and unprofessional , I would recommend coming here for the wide selections of games.', 'date': '2019-06-01 21:14:32', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 3.5, 'yelping_since': '2014-09-10 00:48:23'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'YcYiRGKOjVN9bqa2wQMDGw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'w3pxYLICTV3R5_b9BE-MbQ', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Games: So many games!

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would\\'ve liked to end the evening. \\n\\nOverall: Great concept, and I\\'ll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee.

Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn\\'t say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \\n\\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like!

Upon walking in, the place had a very welcoming vibe- warm yet spacey, a wall chopped full of games, and at that moment a couple of large parties enjoying brunch and playing board games. We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \\n\\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner\\'s chicken and waffles was cold and bland. Yet again, had to call over another person to get it remade. \\n\\nI really believe the place has potential! To be around a year and a half already it\\'s clearly doing something right. Food and drinks on the pricey end but filling nonetheless. The food and the atmosphere was good, I really believe we just had an incredibly bad and maybe even new server that couldn\\'t handle two 4-tops and one 2-top simultaneously...

They didn\\'t take reservations for groups under 12, which is understandable since it seems like a small place. When we arrived, one person from our party was going to be 30 mins late. They said they couldnt seat us until we were all there. We asked if we could just have a table and add a chair later, they said no. We asked if we could sit at the communal table for now and just move to a table when we were all there. The WOC behind the counter spun her head around and rudely said \"No! I\\'ll tell you right now, that\\'s not happening.\" Apparently if we want to switch tables, we need to close out our checks and then open a new tab. Okay, whatever. We sit at the communal table which was pretty empty and hoped the empty seat beside us stays empty.

Can\\'t be seated if the whole party isn\\'t there and they give your reservation up if you\\'re not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late. Since it was late in the evening they let them sit down without me there. This isn\\'t some five star restaurant so I don\\'t see why this is all necessary. \\n\\nOur board game expert person introduced himself at the beginning and explained how it works and that he can help us choose stuff and play the games if needed. All well and good except he never came back around to check on us or see if we needed help or anything. The game selection is VAST which is great if you\\'re into board games. That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \\n\\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn\\'t hard to make but literally took 30min to come out. He also never came by to clear used cups and dishes, and having extra table space when playing a board game seems reasonable...To top it all off, tip was included  so our server made away with a decent tip even though he more or less ignored us and did everything wrong the whole night. \\n\\nThe one nice thing was that they didn\\'t kick us out after the 2.5 hr listed time limit. It was nearing closing time and the place was clearing out so it just made sense to let us sit there till midnight. \\n\\nGreat concept, love the collection of board games, but the price seems a bit much, the drinks are hit or miss (mostly miss) and the service (both our server and the Game Master Person) was terrible.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

And not only that, a place FILLED with so many types of board games and helpful people to teach you how to play these board games! I was here with a group of 12 this past Sunday, and it's often a challenge to find a game that is suitable for a group this size. The shelves are stocked with so many games categorized by type of game, difficulty level, and group size. We ended up playing two games, Deception and Hive Minds, and it was one of the best afternoons I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nYou pay a flat rate of $5.00 to use the space and play the games, which, I think is a bargain, considering they have to replenish the games often and keep them pristine. Here's looking at you, people with Cheeto fingers. During off-peak hours, you are welcome to stay until closing, and then during peak days/hours, the $5.00 is good for 2 1/2 hours, and you are free to replenish.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left. Other than the fact that the hostess was rude and unprofessional , I would recommend coming here for the wide selections of games.', 'date': '2019-06-01 21:14:32', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 3.5, 'yelping_since': '2014-09-10 00:48:23'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'YcYiRGKOjVN9bqa2wQMDGw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'w3pxYLICTV3R5_b9BE-MbQ', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Games: So many games!

But, they tax that $7 to make it about $7.50, then add it to your food/drink bill and expect you to tip on it? The food and drink are okay, but WAY overpriced. French bread pizza looks like it was made in a Tiny Kitchen.

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would\\'ve liked to end the evening. \\n\\nOverall: Great concept, and I\\'ll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee. But I want to be clear that it was not exorbitant - please, visit this place. It's worth it. Just don't go in with the expectation that it's on the frugal way to spend a night out. Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games? If the owner lets me set up a bedroom so I can live there, I look forward to everyone coming over to my new house and playing games!

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn\\'t say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \\n\\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \\n\\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice. Even when one of our party mentioned an example of a game she\\'d played before and asked if there was anything similar we never got a straight answer, so we kind of gave up and she picked something she had played before to start us off. \\n\\nIf you\\'re like me and haven\\'t played many board games, I would do some research beforehand so you know what to grab when you get there.

Upon walking in, the place had a very welcoming vibe- warm yet spacey, a wall chopped full of games, and at that moment a couple of large parties enjoying brunch and playing board games. We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \\n\\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \\n\\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner\\'s chicken and waffles was cold and bland.

My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn\\'t hard to make but literally took 30min to come out. He also never came by to clear used cups and dishes, and having extra table space when playing a board game seems reasonable...To top it all off, tip was included  so our server made away with a decent tip even though he more or less ignored us and did everything wrong the whole night. \\n\\nThe one nice thing was that they didn\\'t kick us out after the 2.5 hr listed time limit. It was nearing closing time and the place was clearing out so it just made sense to let us sit there till midnight. \\n\\nGreat concept, love the collection of board games, but the price seems a bit much, the drinks are hit or miss (mostly miss) and the service (both our server and the Game Master Person) was terrible.

The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \\n\\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \\n\\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \\n\\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \\n\\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added. The bill per person was over $70 each for 2 hours of gaming with all the upcharged and hidden fees. \\n\\nI'm truly shocked and dismayed at not just the poor service and disorganization, but the rudeness and apparently hostility of the staff.\", 'date': '2019-02-14 14:24:54', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 62, 'average_stars': 3.05, 'yelping_since': '2013-02-19 18:17:23'}}\n[R2] {'review_id': 'Ymtwvu8SDL7m6aooGpPYrA', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'z1sB41CiQN_Ggks47NGmZw', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': \"Super aggravated that a small group of us drove more than a half hour in the rain and found parking in Fairmount just to be told it was a 3 hour wait.

We ended up playing two games, Deception and Hive Minds, and it was one of the best afternoons I've had in a very long time. \\n\\nYou pay a flat rate of $5.00 to use the space and play the games, which, I think is a bargain, considering they have to replenish the games often and keep them pristine. Here's looking at you, people with Cheeto fingers. During off-peak hours, you are welcome to stay until closing, and then during peak days/hours, the $5.00 is good for 2 1/2 hours, and you are free to replenish. There is a separate menu for some light bites, coffee, milkshakes, desserts, and cocktails. \\n\\nI didn't find anything food-wise on the menu that really stood out, so a suggestion would be to offer more group friendly appetizers or sharing plates. \\n\\nOtherwise, this place has such a chill vibe, and it's a wonderful spot to gather with family/friends to have some laughs and play some games.\", 'date': '2019-05-23 18:30:17', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 159, 'average_stars': 3.83, 'yelping_since': '2013-12-16 19:43:04'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'dQpN8JVySEVllvRLiDnnFw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': '-90vnhYrMQLFyW2ZFAgk2Q', 'stars': 2.0, 'text': 'My friends and I love games and heard about this place. We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there\\'s another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn\\'t it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y\\'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table. They wanted their own table (a bunch were open now). My friends felt so unwelcome because of the hostess and left. Other than the fact that the hostess was rude and unprofessional , I would recommend coming here for the wide selections of games.', 'date': '2019-06-01 21:14:32', 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 3.5, 'yelping_since': '2014-09-10 00:48:23'}}\n[R5] {'review_id': 'YcYiRGKOjVN9bqa2wQMDGw', 'business_id': '1klRUBB6LfKCotq75BVmbA', 'user_id': 'w3pxYLICTV3R5_b9BE-MbQ', 'stars': 3.0, 'text': 'Games: So many games!

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don\\'t do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\\n\\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we\\'ll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\\n\\nI only didn\\'t give a whole 5 stars because I wasn\\'t wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it\\'s not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn\\'t know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don\\'t eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn\\'t really know what to do. \\n\\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn\\'t hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn\\'t hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \\n\\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up. They were even offering to make game suggestions and made themselves available to explain rules if needed. Clearly they're going beyond just handling your food/drinks etc - they are there to actually help move you through the games themselves as well which is awesome!\\n\\nThe food was quite good and I liked the beer selection. The only drawback was the price. We ordered a decent amount of food/drink but the bill was a tad higher than I expected even after the $7/person game fee.

Again, it's still worth every red penny for the fun had there. So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does. I've been to bars/breweries that try to push the board game element, and usually it's just a small area with a lot of hand-me-down copies of games with tattered boxes or out of date versions. Not only does Thirsty Dice have over 800 games, it looks like they're buying up brand new copies of everything, and the selection is new and current. I know the prices of some of these games and they are not cheap. So them having this selection is amazing. \\n\\nI want to just live there. Can I please live there and play all of the games?

We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it.

While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It\\'s up to you!\" Of course it\\'s up to us, but a little direction would have been nice.

As someone who\\'s worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing.

The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each.

A few people around me had the mac and cheese and it looks incredible, so I will definitely try that the next time I swing by. \\n\\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my time at Thirsty Dice. This place is great for groups of all sizes, but I would say it is more adult-oriented so I wouldn\\'t bring kids here (although they do have a great selection of kids board games that will make you very nostalgic).

Thirsty Dice has you covered. Thirsty Dice is among the first of what could potentially be a new craze in Philadelphia: board game cafes. For $7 per person per sitting, you have access to over 800 board games, from classics like Candy Land to Settlers of Catan to more complicated strategic board games that take hours to finish. The games are arranged by number of players as well as by level of involvement. The staff are super friendly and are always willing to teach a game to a group of people, but they do recommend that you learn the rules to the complicated board games before attempting to play them at the cafe.\\n\\nIn terms of food, Thirsty Dice has some small snacks like different flavored popcorn and some party mixes (sweet and savory). They also have personal pizzas and some bomb Mac and cheeses. The personal pizzas are pretty small and average tasting, essentially pizza on a baguette roll, but the Mac and cheeses are stellar. The group favorite was  the Grown-Up mac and cheese. We ended up ordering 3 of them to split, they were so good.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\\n\\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\\n\\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

The perfect spot for a quick affordable brunch option while headed to a near by museum, walking through Fairmount Park, or even gabbing with friends. The interior is small but with community tables and high top bar seating around the edges it's easy to find a spot. There is additional outdoor seating. We tried their Pork Bahn Mi+fried egg, Traditional Bahn Mi (pate and cold cuts)+fried egg, and their sausage+egg+cheese breakfast sandwich. I'm fairly picky with bahn mi's but I found this to be one of the better ones in the city. The pickled veggies were crisp and tangy with the perfect amount of aioli to round out the rich fat profile of the sandwich. The bread was warm and toasty -- fillings were plentiful, fresh, and balanced. The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full. The breakfast sandwich really paled in comparison to bahn mi options. I would recommend going with the bahn mi's over the breakfast sandwiches if you're making a decision. The breakfast sandwich itself was exceptionally savory with the buttery croissant onion roll-Esque vehicle of the Sausage/egg/cheese filling being the highlight.

The service is great, I noticed the owner knew people's orders as they walked in the door, and he even corrected the barista on my name (which is always butchered). The coffee is Toby's estate, which any serious coffee drinker will appreciate. Banh mi's I think are very good for the location. The meat is flavorful, albeit on the light side, so ask for more to be safe. Baguette is fresh, crispy, yet soft inside. And veggies are fresh.

We tried their Pork Bahn Mi+fried egg, Traditional Bahn Mi (pate and cold cuts)+fried egg, and their sausage+egg+cheese breakfast sandwich. I'm fairly picky with bahn mi's but I found this to be one of the better ones in the city. The pickled veggies were crisp and tangy with the perfect amount of aioli to round out the rich fat profile of the sandwich. The bread was warm and toasty -- fillings were plentiful, fresh, and balanced. The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full. The breakfast sandwich really paled in comparison to bahn mi options. I would recommend going with the bahn mi's over the breakfast sandwiches if you're making a decision.

The banh mi was phenomenal, the French bread was perfectly toasted, soft inside, and crispy outside, it's quality noticeably better than other places I've had banh mi in philly. The pate was light and fresh, and there was a generous portion of pickled daikon. However, they did go a little heavy on the jalape\u00f1o which at times was overwhelming, and the sandwich could have used a little more meat. Overall, I would come back for breakfast at this little cafe, the atmosphere was inviting, they had games at the table, and the barista was very friendly.

We tried their Pork Bahn Mi+fried egg, Traditional Bahn Mi (pate and cold cuts)+fried egg, and their sausage+egg+cheese breakfast sandwich. I'm fairly picky with bahn mi's but I found this to be one of the better ones in the city. The pickled veggies were crisp and tangy with the perfect amount of aioli to round out the rich fat profile of the sandwich. The bread was warm and toasty -- fillings were plentiful, fresh, and balanced. The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full. The breakfast sandwich really paled in comparison to bahn mi options. I would recommend going with the bahn mi's over the breakfast sandwiches if you're making a decision. The breakfast sandwich itself was exceptionally savory with the buttery croissant onion roll-Esque vehicle of the Sausage/egg/cheese filling being the highlight.

The banh mi was phenomenal, the French bread was perfectly toasted, soft inside, and crispy outside, it's quality noticeably better than other places I've had banh mi in philly. The pate was light and fresh, and there was a generous portion of pickled daikon.

We tried their Pork Bahn Mi+fried egg, Traditional Bahn Mi (pate and cold cuts)+fried egg, and their sausage+egg+cheese breakfast sandwich. I'm fairly picky with bahn mi's but I found this to be one of the better ones in the city. The pickled veggies were crisp and tangy with the perfect amount of aioli to round out the rich fat profile of the sandwich. The bread was warm and toasty -- fillings were plentiful, fresh, and balanced. The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full. The breakfast sandwich really paled in comparison to bahn mi options. I would recommend going with the bahn mi's over the breakfast sandwiches if you're making a decision.

They have regular coffee, pastries, and breakfast sandwiches, but the star of the show was the iced Vietnamese coffee and classic Vietnamese banh mi. The iced coffee was strong, but sweet, and reminded me of the way my grandma makes it, never shy about the strength. The banh mi was phenomenal, the French bread was perfectly toasted, soft inside, and crispy outside, it's quality noticeably better than other places I've had banh mi in philly. The pate was light and fresh, and there was a generous portion of pickled daikon. However, they did go a little heavy on the jalape\u00f1o which at times was overwhelming, and the sandwich could have used a little more meat.

The bread was warm and toasty -- fillings were plentiful, fresh, and balanced. The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full. The breakfast sandwich really paled in comparison to bahn mi options. I would recommend going with the bahn mi's over the breakfast sandwiches if you're making a decision.

I didn\\'t feel like ordering anything because of their bad attitude, so I left and waited two months before coming back. \\n\\nThe second time there was one barista, who was not rude, so this time I ordered.  While waiting, I realized that I wanted to leave, (but didn\\'t)  because of the depressing decor, including flavorless \"art\".  I have seen more interesting artwork in a doctor\\'s office.  Speaking of medical settings, the entire time I was waiting, I felt that at any moment a doctor was about to emerge from the back room, to tell me of the grim prognosis of one of my loved ones.  Yeah, I felt like I was in a hospital waiting room or doctor\\'s office or morgue waiting room.  Very STERILE and NO personality.     The people who run this place are clearly afraid of color.

My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me.

They boast a large selection of loose leaf teas, and brew times are monitored carefully and selected appropriate to the type of tea.

I found the prices to be quite reasonable, especially considering the quality of the coffee and tea. \\n\\nAs one reviewer said, the decor is a little sterile for Fishtown, it almost does kind of remind me of an airport or post office. The place is huge for a coffee shop, very modern and spread out. I suppose it is good if you don't like anyone sitting near you. It would be a great location for a jazz trio to play in the evening.

I'm typically not a tea drinker but their selection is great and I have ended up heading back over midday for something different. My only wish is that they would have a stevia option along with the sugar, simple syrup, and splenda at the add-in's bar. I am sugar free but only use stevia. Very few places have it, but they really stand out when they do. Luckily I live close enough to just go back home and add it.\\n\\nLooks like the people working there in the beginning had attitude. I had not been in until about a month ago but have had no issues with anyone - and I've got a pretty darn low tolerance for that sort of thing.\\n\\nOverall they are friendly, have quality coffee and tea, and are reasonably priced.

As a grad student who gets the most work done at cafes early in the mornings, Steap and Grind appeared to be an awesome find.\\n\\nI came here around 8am on a weekday to get some work done. There was no one at the counter, but I saw that there was one patron sitting and getting some work done so I thought the barista must have just gone to the bathroom or something. \\n\\nEventually, he came out (I waited probably about 5 minutes), took my order. Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\\n\\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers\\' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\\n\\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because the scone and the coffee left my taste buds wanting for more. It is very plausible that today was just an off-day.

I'd been craving this ever since I tried the cream tea tradition in Cornwall last month!!!), their nice selection of vegetarian options (the Melter Skelter, Vegan Curry Chicken and some delicious sprout-filled take on a caprese, among others), and a ton of delicious baked goods, even on the days that the scones were sold out, I had tons to choose from.

As a grad student who gets the most work done at cafes early in the mornings, Steap and Grind appeared to be an awesome find.\\n\\nI came here around 8am on a weekday to get some work done. There was no one at the counter, but I saw that there was one patron sitting and getting some work done so I thought the barista must have just gone to the bathroom or something. \\n\\nEventually, he came out (I waited probably about 5 minutes), took my order. Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\\n\\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers\\' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\\n\\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless.

The guy behind the counter took my order, with his Dunkin Donuts iced coffee on the counter...not a good sign. They use an iPad for their POS system, and it wasn\\'t working properly. I called ahead to make sure they took credit cards, yet when I arrived their credit card system was down. Not a big deal, as I\\'m sure they just didn\\'t know at the time. Eventually I had to pay cash for my order, which took quite sometime to finish.\\n\\nAlso, apparently they have to run into a separate back room to prepare a bagel with cream cheese. I only saw three listed bagels on their little board, poppy seed, something else, and salt.  I ordered the salt bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The Americano was just ok, and the bagel was bad; it was like the texture of a stale soft pretzel.  I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever disliked a bagel more than this particular bagel...maybe it was just a bad bagel day.\\n\\nI may give them another chance, but I was a little put off by the lack of sympathy and concern for me, the customer, as I waited around for 10 minutes just to pay cash.  They seemed rather unapologetic and lethargic in dealing with the payment issue; thank goodness they didn\\'t have a line of people.  My last tip is for the \"barista\", you literally have any coffee drink you can imagine at your finger tips...don\\'t bring a cream and sugar infused iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts to work.

Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response.

It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\".

I'd been craving this ever since I tried the cream tea tradition in Cornwall last month!!!), their nice selection of vegetarian options (the Melter Skelter, Vegan Curry Chicken and some delicious sprout-filled take on a caprese, among others), and a ton of delicious baked goods, even on the days that the scones were sold out, I had tons to choose from.

It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because the scone and the coffee left my taste buds wanting for more. It is very plausible that today was just an off-day.

Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\\n\\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers\\' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\\n\\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless.

I'd been craving this ever since I tried the cream tea tradition in Cornwall last month!!!), their nice selection of vegetarian options (the Melter Skelter, Vegan Curry Chicken and some delicious sprout-filled take on a caprese, among others), and a ton of delicious baked goods, even on the days that the scones were sold out, I had tons to choose from.

It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless.

I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever disliked a bagel more than this particular bagel...maybe it was just a bad bagel day.\\n\\nI may give them another chance, but I was a little put off by the lack of sympathy and concern for me, the customer, as I waited around for 10 minutes just to pay cash.  They seemed rather unapologetic and lethargic in dealing with the payment issue; thank goodness they didn\\'t have a line of people.  My last tip is for the \"barista\", you literally have any coffee drink you can imagine at your finger tips...don\\'t bring a cream and sugar infused iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts to work.

I brought my coffee snob friends from Pittsburgh here and not only did they buy a few pounds to take home, they joked they were thinking of moving back to Philly just for this place.\\nThe espresso is always smooth and delicious, never burnt or bitter.

Black tea with coconut is the best thing I\\'ve ever tasted, and I\\'m not even a huge tea guy, but I buy a bag every couple weeks to keep the fridge stocked with iced tea.

I'm typically not a tea drinker but their selection is great and I have ended up heading back over midday for something different. My only wish is that they would have a stevia option along with the sugar, simple syrup, and splenda at the add-in's bar. I am sugar free but only use stevia. Very few places have it, but they really stand out when they do. Luckily I live close enough to just go back home and add it.\\n\\nLooks like the people working there in the beginning had attitude. I had not been in until about a month ago but have had no issues with anyone - and I've got a pretty darn low tolerance for that sort of thing.\\n\\nOverall they are friendly, have quality coffee and tea, and are reasonably priced.

Nice, open atmosphere. Freshly baked scones with delicious clotted cream and the Americano was superb - all at a reasonable price. AND they accept credit cards with a reliable wifi! As a grad student who gets the most work done at cafes early in the mornings, Steap and Grind appeared to be an awesome find.\\n\\nI came here around 8am on a weekday to get some work done. There was no one at the counter, but I saw that there was one patron sitting and getting some work done so I thought the barista must have just gone to the bathroom or something. \\n\\nEventually, he came out (I waited probably about 5 minutes), took my order. Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\\n\\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers\\' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\\n\\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It\\'s not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\\n\\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it\\'s just coincidence.\\n\\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\\n\\nSeriously, this doesn\\'t sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn\\'t). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \\n\\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\\n\\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn\\'t)\\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\\n- Maybe he doesn\\'t like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\\n\\nRegardless. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because the scone and the coffee left my taste buds wanting for more. It is very plausible that today was just an off-day.

I want to curl up in a chair and just stay. Which is sad because I generally go here the most when I'm already late for work and grabbing a latte to go. Their lattes are unlike anything I've ever had. The espresso they use is bold, yet mellow and not bitter at all. The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \\n\\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in. It was like ever since her show I kept thinking, I should really try this place. \\n\\nAnyway. I usually get a iced soy latte, or a black and white soy latte, or the iced coffee.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who\\'s welcome, definitely go elsewhere.

There are bar stools overlooking the store front, and lots of small tables. Another plus is that the large bookshelf in the middle room is full of games and puzzles and even playing cards. The BF and I kept ourselves amused with a never-ending game of Uno, so we really appreciated the fact that Chapterhouse had distractions available. \\n  \\nHowever, that's where the positives end, unfortunately. The baristas were pretty grumpy when we asked them what drinks we'd be eligible for with our coupons (understandable), but their attitude didn't even change after we tipped them. Rude. My tea lacked flavor and my crappy paper cup (hello, sustainability!) had a slow leak which meant I lost most of my drink to the tabletop. Blah. Lastly, on a Sunday afternoon, the place was super packed. Most people looked like they hadn't moved in eons from their tables and didn't plan on moving for another several millenniums either. If I had paid good money for a cup of coffee and atmosphere, I'd be pretty annoyed that there was no space to sit.

And by the time I drag my behind out of the house to study, I have about 5 minutes to get settled in somewhere before I\\'ve lost momentum or been distracted by something else.

Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat.

The wifi in the basement is extremely slow. Also, the basement is VERY cold (even when its warm outside) and dark. There is a lightbulb out which makes my studying even more dismal, and to make matters worse their only lamp is broken. The basement can get really noisy with people stomping on the basement doors from the street. \\n\\nI also am unsure if I like the vibe I get from the workers anymore. They used to be friendly, but recently everyone has an \"I am too cool for you\" attitude, with little to no friendliness. I barely get a greeting when I walk in the door. When getting more hot water for my tea (complimentary), I am walking back to my chair and a worker says, \"Oh, did you get a refill?\" Well, yes I did, your co-worker at the cash register got it for me. The comment was in a very accusatory/surprised tone, like I had either helped myself to some hot water or failed to pay for something that was....free. It was very off putting. \\n\\nFinally, the food is nothing to write home about. The selection is pretty slim.

I wonder how often he does that, since there seem to be no references to the Ron Paul revolution in the current reviews. Then again, maybe Philly hipsters like Ron Paul. \\n\\nIn any case, this review is emphatically NOT based on my feelings about the Chapterhouse's proud libertarianism.

Haranguing private messages to your clientele are a tad bit uncouth, but the sullenness and near-hostility I've encountered from the baristas on both of my return visits have driven home to me that this is just not a very friendly and inviting place.

When you approach the counter you will be greeted warmly and given time to choose what you'd like to order.  There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\\n\\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\\n\\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\\n\\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\\n\\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.  Also I remember the two previous incarnations of the space, Grinds and Finds, a vintage clothing store/cafe, followed by an unpronounceable, short lived, lackluster cafe.

A bagel with cream cheese.\" He sighed and pointed to an empty basket. I nodded and he said, \"What else?\". I just smiled, waved and walked out. He might had mumbled something as I left but I made it clear that he failed to do a simple task.

Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who\\'s welcome, definitely go elsewhere.

Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat.

I love the \"it\\'s like I\\'m in someones home/ interior\" and I feel like I should ask someone if it\\'s OK I\\'m even here. Will the owner pop up and go \"Who the fuck are you?! Why are you in my house man!?\" Just kidding. But especially in the back it\\'s homey. Complete with sketchbooks to add doodles in, old mags, vintage and updated Ikea-style furniture. Not bad. \\n\\nThough my only complaint and why they get three stars is well...\\n\\nAn employee was kind of taken back of me. I stood politely around 3pm about a year from now waiting to get a bagel. The barista was busy stocking cups and refilling syrup bottles. I know what it\\'s like and allowed him to continue his chores till finally after five minutes he turned around and whipped out \"What?!\". I said \"Um... A bagel with cream cheese.\" He sighed and pointed to an empty basket. I nodded and he said, \"What else?\". I just smiled, waved and walked out. He might had mumbled something as I left but I made it clear that he failed to do a simple task. A task I know can be hard to do at all times but it\\'s something we are paid with the job of food service to do. I know we all have it tough but handing out negative energy is like a leech and it attaches itself very tightly to your balls. \\n\\nSo will I stop coming here? No. There are still positive things in mind and some other employees aren\\'t so bad. Though I know the majority of them give better service to people they eye up and go \"Oh my god! I know she likes \"Kate Bush\"!\" You\\'d be surprised what people really are underneath their \"Ramones\" t-shirt.

The barista, her name is Michelle, she has red-curly hair and I believe that she is referenced in other comments in a not so positive light. Anyway, today I was inspecting various shops, books stores, etc in Philadelphia to find a spot for my next book signing (I am an author). I popped into Chapter House for about 35 minutes to send an email, considered the possibility of doing a book signing here and waiting for my girlfriend. Upon leaving the cafe, the cashier, Michelle, yells from the counter and across the room, \"You didn\\'t buy anything... this isn\\'t a study hall where you just come and don\\'t buy anything\". I was appalled and turned around, as I couldn\\'t believe I was being badgered from across the cafe by a barista. I explained to the barista that I always buy something when I come to this cafe and that I just didn\\'t today, as I was in a hurry. She continued to badger me in an attempt to humiliate me in front of the entire cafe.  She said \"everyone else in here has bought something\". This is even more alarming as I beg to know how/why she focused her attention on ME. Her presumptions of me, as a kid \"at a study hall\" may have been most appalling as I am a doctor, far from a child using the cafe as a \"study hall\". Shouldn\\'t matter if I were. I called once I left to ask her for her managers name and she refused to give me the managers name! Unbelievable. I will be sending a letter in the mail, as well as trying to get in contact with the owner/ manager again today or tomorrow.

It was very irritating trying to do work with such a slow WiFi.\\n\\nHonestly, the cafe was overcrowded and its facilities weren't the best. The only saving grace was their drinks.

The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \\n\\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in. It was like ever since her show I kept thinking, I should really try this place. \\n\\nAnyway. I usually get a iced soy latte, or a black and white soy latte, or the iced coffee.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.

Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat.

The barista, her name is Michelle, she has red-curly hair and I believe that she is referenced in other comments in a not so positive light. Anyway, today I was inspecting various shops, books stores, etc in Philadelphia to find a spot for my next book signing (I am an author). I popped into Chapter House for about 35 minutes to send an email, considered the possibility of doing a book signing here and waiting for my girlfriend. Upon leaving the cafe, the cashier, Michelle, yells from the counter and across the room, \"You didn\\'t buy anything... this isn\\'t a study hall where you just come and don\\'t buy anything\". I was appalled and turned around, as I couldn\\'t believe I was being badgered from across the cafe by a barista. I explained to the barista that I always buy something when I come to this cafe and that I just didn\\'t today, as I was in a hurry. She continued to badger me in an attempt to humiliate me in front of the entire cafe.  She said \"everyone else in here has bought something\". This is even more alarming as I beg to know how/why she focused her attention on ME. Her presumptions of me, as a kid \"at a study hall\" may have been most appalling as I am a doctor, far from a child using the cafe as a \"study hall\". Shouldn\\'t matter if I were. I called once I left to ask her for her managers name and she refused to give me the managers name! Unbelievable. I will be sending a letter in the mail, as well as trying to get in contact with the owner/ manager again today or tomorrow.

The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \\n\\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.

The baristas were pretty grumpy when we asked them what drinks we'd be eligible for with our coupons (understandable), but their attitude didn't even change after we tipped them. Rude. My tea lacked flavor and my crappy paper cup (hello, sustainability!) had a slow leak which meant I lost most of my drink to the tabletop. Blah.

And by the time I drag my behind out of the house to study, I have about 5 minutes to get settled in somewhere before I\\'ve lost momentum or been distracted by something else.  So that\\'s hit-or-miss.  HOWEVER, they have \"recently\" opened a downstairs, so it may be less difficult to find a work space than in the past.  (2) The chairs aren\\'t that comfortable.  They have a lot of those chairs with stringy bodies that are just not sturdy enough for my personal taste.  I need comfort and security to get work done.  What can I say?  (3) The music is often too distracting.

Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat. But as coffeeshops go, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more versatile, interesting, and welcoming one. \\n\\nThis is exactly the kind of place I want to open someday.

I want to curl up in a chair and just stay. Which is sad because I generally go here the most when I'm already late for work and grabbing a latte to go. Their lattes are unlike anything I've ever had. The espresso they use is bold, yet mellow and not bitter at all. The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \\n\\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in. It was like ever since her show I kept thinking, I should really try this place. \\n\\nAnyway. I usually get a iced soy latte, or a black and white soy latte, or the iced coffee.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who\\'s welcome, definitely go elsewhere.

There are bar stools overlooking the store front, and lots of small tables. Another plus is that the large bookshelf in the middle room is full of games and puzzles and even playing cards. The BF and I kept ourselves amused with a never-ending game of Uno, so we really appreciated the fact that Chapterhouse had distractions available. \\n  \\nHowever, that's where the positives end, unfortunately. The baristas were pretty grumpy when we asked them what drinks we'd be eligible for with our coupons (understandable), but their attitude didn't even change after we tipped them. Rude. My tea lacked flavor and my crappy paper cup (hello, sustainability!) had a slow leak which meant I lost most of my drink to the tabletop. Blah. Lastly, on a Sunday afternoon, the place was super packed. Most people looked like they hadn't moved in eons from their tables and didn't plan on moving for another several millenniums either. If I had paid good money for a cup of coffee and atmosphere, I'd be pretty annoyed that there was no space to sit.

I used to live two blocks away from Chapterhouse, and it was my go-to coffee place for a year and a half. Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.)

It's always so crowded--I never know whether I'll be able to get a table.  Sometimes the music is unbearably loud.  Yes, it's often full of pretentious hipsters.  But!  It's just such a wonderful space.  When it's full of people studying, it feels truly hallowed.  No one speaks to break the silence, which is so important to my studying.  Still, it's not so stuffy that I feel badly answering my cell phone if it rings.  Another perk: free wi-fi!  Awesome for those days when I need Internet to get my work done (and equally great for those I'm-so-sick-of-studying moments, to provide a welcome distraction).\\n\\nAs I've mentioned in my other reviews, I am not a coffee drinker.  Friends do like their coffee, but I think their espresso drinks are even more well-loved.  My boyfriend likes their Mexican mocha.  My favorite drink is the soy chai.  For some reason, Chapterhouse's soy chai is my favorite chai in all of Philadelphia.  I don't know what the owner does to make it taste different, but it's consistently delicious.  They also have tasty sandwiches and ridiculously good cookies.  The brownies and various other bars are hit or miss.\\n\\nThough it's crowded and sometimes annoying, I will continue to venture out of East Falls to visit Chapterhouse.  I can't resist the atmosphere, that awesome chai, and the overall allure of this lovely spot.

There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\\n\\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\\n\\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\\n\\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\\n\\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.

Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch.

But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location.

When you approach the counter you will be greeted warmly and given time to choose what you'd like to order.  There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\\n\\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\\n\\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\\n\\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\\n\\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.  Also I remember the two previous incarnations of the space, Grinds and Finds, a vintage clothing store/cafe, followed by an unpronounceable, short lived, lackluster cafe.

A bagel with cream cheese.\" He sighed and pointed to an empty basket. I nodded and he said, \"What else?\". I just smiled, waved and walked out.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.

I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.

I used to live two blocks away from Chapterhouse, and it was my go-to coffee place for a year and a half. Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\\n\\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\\n\\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\\n\\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat. But as coffeeshops go, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more versatile, interesting, and welcoming one. \\n\\nThis is exactly the kind of place I want to open someday.

Still, it's not so stuffy that I feel badly answering my cell phone if it rings.  Another perk: free wi-fi!  Awesome for those days when I need Internet to get my work done (and equally great for those I'm-so-sick-of-studying moments, to provide a welcome distraction).\\n\\nAs I've mentioned in my other reviews, I am not a coffee drinker.  Friends do like their coffee, but I think their espresso drinks are even more well-loved.  My boyfriend likes their Mexican mocha.  My favorite drink is the soy chai.  For some reason, Chapterhouse's soy chai is my favorite chai in all of Philadelphia.  I don't know what the owner does to make it taste different, but it's consistently delicious.  They also have tasty sandwiches and ridiculously good cookies.  The brownies and various other bars are hit or miss.\\n\\nThough it's crowded and sometimes annoying, I will continue to venture out of East Falls to visit Chapterhouse.

It was very irritating trying to do work with such a slow WiFi.\\n\\nHonestly, the cafe was overcrowded and its facilities weren't the best. The only saving grace was their drinks.

He goes the extra mile by making sure that your not allergic to any ingredient in the more involved drinks, and goes the extra mile with his preparation.

I want to curl up in a chair and just stay. Which is sad because I generally go here the most when I'm already late for work and grabbing a latte to go. Their lattes are unlike anything I've ever had. The espresso they use is bold, yet mellow and not bitter at all. The soy milk they use (lactose and me we are not friends) is the tastiest soy milk I've had in many years as a soy drinker. \\n\\nThe place is lovely. It really is. I need to spend some more time just hanging out here because I think I could find a nice home here. As so many other writers have said. I was at a Amanda Palmer show this past year and she was on stage talking about how much she loved it here. She's right. it's lovely, maybe that's what finally sparked the interest in going in. It was like ever since her show I kept thinking, I should really try this place. \\n\\nAnyway. I usually get a iced soy latte, or a black and white soy latte, or the iced coffee. I've seen the gorgeous things they do with the steamed milk going into the espresso, they truly are artists at the coffee bar.

It\\'s hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\\n\\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks\\' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you\\'re doing something wrong.)\\n\\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don\\'t object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I\\'ve been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I\\'m a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn\\'t part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\\n\\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who\\'s welcome, definitely go elsewhere.

There are bar stools overlooking the store front, and lots of small tables. Another plus is that the large bookshelf in the middle room is full of games and puzzles and even playing cards. The BF and I kept ourselves amused with a never-ending game of Uno, so we really appreciated the fact that Chapterhouse had distractions available. \\n  \\nHowever, that's where the positives end, unfortunately. The baristas were pretty grumpy when we asked them what drinks we'd be eligible for with our coupons (understandable), but their attitude didn't even change after we tipped them. Rude. My tea lacked flavor and my crappy paper cup (hello, sustainability!) had a slow leak which meant I lost most of my drink to the tabletop. Blah. Lastly, on a Sunday afternoon, the place was super packed. Most people looked like they hadn't moved in eons from their tables and didn't plan on moving for another several millenniums either. If I had paid good money for a cup of coffee and atmosphere, I'd be pretty annoyed that there was no space to sit.

But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location.

I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\\n\\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat. But as coffeeshops go, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more versatile, interesting, and welcoming one. \\n\\nThis is exactly the kind of place I want to open someday.

It's always so crowded--I never know whether I'll be able to get a table.  Sometimes the music is unbearably loud.  Yes, it's often full of pretentious hipsters.  But!  It's just such a wonderful space.  When it's full of people studying, it feels truly hallowed.  No one speaks to break the silence, which is so important to my studying.  Still, it's not so stuffy that I feel badly answering my cell phone if it rings.  Another perk: free wi-fi!  Awesome for those days when I need Internet to get my work done (and equally great for those I'm-so-sick-of-studying moments, to provide a welcome distraction).\\n\\nAs I've mentioned in my other reviews, I am not a coffee drinker.  Friends do like their coffee, but I think their espresso drinks are even more well-loved.  My boyfriend likes their Mexican mocha.  My favorite drink is the soy chai.  For some reason, Chapterhouse's soy chai is my favorite chai in all of Philadelphia.  I don't know what the owner does to make it taste different, but it's consistently delicious.  They also have tasty sandwiches and ridiculously good cookies.  The brownies and various other bars are hit or miss.\\n\\nThough it's crowded and sometimes annoying, I will continue to venture out of East Falls to visit Chapterhouse.  I can't resist the atmosphere, that awesome chai, and the overall allure of this lovely spot.

The basement can get really noisy with people stomping on the basement doors from the street. \\n\\nI also am unsure if I like the vibe I get from the workers anymore.

When you approach the counter you will be greeted warmly and given time to choose what you'd like to order.  There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\\n\\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\\n\\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\\n\\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\\n\\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.

What WASN\\'T too much to ask, apparently, was a full 20% tip automatically applied to our check (which was NOT specified in their cert btw, or anywhere else for that matter).  While they did adjust our check for the two earlier mistakes, we still ended up paying a lot more than we had hoped.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not love this place.

I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.

That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\\n\\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\\n\\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

It wasn't what I've typically come to expect a crabcake to be. It was more like a crab salad patty that was tossed on the grill for about a minute. It was actually served  lukewarm. \\n\\nOkay.. so the crabcake was different than I expected.... but it was still GOOD once I got that idea out of my head. The sweet potato fries were very good, but not hot enough!  I thought the dipping sauce was the perfect condiment for the fries.\\n\\nBut... BY FAR, the highlight of this mean was the dessert. We ordered a Xando, which is described on the menu as:Rich Cheese Cake Filling Wrapped in a Cinnamon-Sugar Coated Crispy Pastry with a Raspberry Drizzle.

I had the Bibam Bap with seitan -- it was listed as vegan, or so I thought. The food was good enough to bring me back again tonight....\\n\\nAnd despite a good experience last week, tonight the Bubble House experience was HORRENDOUS.  I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.  She meant well and could not have been responsible for the service disaster that followed.  \\n\\nThey were completely out of seitan, the basis for many of the veg versions of the dishes. That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\\n\\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\\n\\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

The food has particularly become more stingy as far as serving size and higher prices.  For example, the vegetarian hoagie, while still tasty, does not even have a full roll of bread anymore.  It comes served on a half piece of bread and is nearly impossible to eat as a sandwich.  Also, the sweet potato fries are not as good as I remember.\\n\\nI haven't eaten an entree there in a while, but the tofu dishes used to be very good. They do have a large number of vegetarian options on the menu, which is a plus for anyone interested.\\n\\nAs for bubble tea, the quality varies greatly based on the person making them.  Sometimes the tea is really good and sometimes it is really watery.  The tea here is not authentic, but I don't think it's a fault because they have some pretty original flavors.  The tea here is different from Chinatown or the like because it is not the frozen-slushy consistency, the bubbles are affected by the temperature of the drink, and there are more flavors.  I really like the chai, watermelon, and strawberry lemonade flavors.  \\n\\nOverall, I'd still be willing to go to the Bubble House occasionally, however, it just isn't the same as it used to be.

Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that\\'s right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2! Of course, they couldn\\'t just apply the cert as a courtesy after all the mistakes that were already made. That was way too much to ask. What WASN\\'T too much to ask, apparently, was a full 20% tip automatically applied to our check (which was NOT specified in their cert btw, or anywhere else for that matter).

I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.

That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\\n\\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\\n\\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

Sometimes the tea is really good and sometimes it is really watery.  The tea here is not authentic, but I don't think it's a fault because they have some pretty original flavors.

What a great way to warm up. \\n\\nFor my entree, I had the crabcake sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. I was a little taken aback when my crabcake came. It wasn't what I've typically come to expect a crabcake to be. It was more like a crab salad patty that was tossed on the grill for about a minute. It was actually served  lukewarm. \\n\\nOkay.. so the crabcake was different than I expected.... but it was still GOOD once I got that idea out of my head. The sweet potato fries were very good, but not hot enough!  I thought the dipping sauce was the perfect condiment for the fries.\\n\\nBut... BY FAR, the highlight of this mean was the dessert. We ordered a Xando, which is described on the menu as:Rich Cheese Cake Filling Wrapped in a Cinnamon-Sugar Coated Crispy Pastry with a Raspberry Drizzle.

Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.

Oh yeah, I know! This is BY FAR the WORSE dining experience I\\'ve EVER had!! With all the poor reviews, I\\'m surprised they make enough to pay the rent each month. Pay close attention to the bad reviews because they are all VERY accurate. Very poor service and management all around. I\\'m honestly disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying this place.\\n\\nThere are so many things that went wrong with our dinner that I hardly know where to begin. First of all, not only did they get our order almost completely wrong, we got something we didn\\'t even order.\\n\\nInstead of getting the Calamari appetizer that we asked for, we got a Calamari salad, which cost more.\\n\\nInstead of getting just a burger, I got one with an extra side that I also did not order, which cost more as well.\\n\\nInstead of getting a MEDIUM steak, my bf got a VERY RARE piece of beef that was lightly seared at most. I should not neglect to mention, however, that they did fix our raw meat problem...they magically turned it into rubber! I didn\\'t know that could be done--amazing!\\n\\nYou would think that at a place called \"Bubble House\" you could at least get some decent bubble tea. Boy, was I mistaken. Also the worse bubble tea I\\'ve every had...& that\\'s saying a lot. Instead of getting the frosted (blended) bubble tea that we anticipated, we got some severely watered-down concoction...and surprisingly enough, the tapioca balls were entirely undercooked. As a matter of fact, the calamari seemed to be the only thing that wasn\\'t undercooked...it was nice and chewy!\\n\\nDid I mention the chicken wings that we did NOT order and had to pay for anyway?! Ironically, that was probably the best dish we got.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, they wouldn\\'t allow us to use the Restaurant.com certificate that we had, even though we ordered well more than the $50 min spend (\"Valid for food only. Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that\\'s right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2! Of course, they couldn\\'t just apply the cert as a courtesy after all the mistakes that were already made. That was way too much to ask. What WASN\\'T too much to ask, apparently, was a full 20% tip automatically applied to our check (which was NOT specified in their cert btw, or anywhere else for that matter).  While they did adjust our check for the two earlier mistakes, we still ended up paying a lot more than we had hoped.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not love this place.

I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.  She meant well and could not have been responsible for the service disaster that followed.  \\n\\nThey were completely out of seitan, the basis for many of the veg versions of the dishes. That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\\n\\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\\n\\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

It wasn't what I've typically come to expect a crabcake to be. It was more like a crab salad patty that was tossed on the grill for about a minute. It was actually served  lukewarm. \\n\\nOkay.. so the crabcake was different than I expected.... but it was still GOOD once I got that idea out of my head. The sweet potato fries were very good, but not hot enough!  I thought the dipping sauce was the perfect condiment for the fries.\\n\\nBut... BY FAR, the highlight of this mean was the dessert.

I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.  She meant well and could not have been responsible for the service disaster that followed.  \\n\\nThey were completely out of seitan, the basis for many of the veg versions of the dishes.

Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option.

Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\\n\\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

Sometimes the tea is really good and sometimes it is really watery.  The tea here is not authentic, but I don't think it's a fault because they have some pretty original flavors.

Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that\\'s right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2! Of course, they couldn\\'t just apply the cert as a courtesy after all the mistakes that were already made. That was way too much to ask.

OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I thought that was very nice, and from there she proceeded to make my latte, which was not great but not offensive, either.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

With that aside, we walked into this little corner shop tucked away nicely and was immediately greeted by the staff behind the counter.  The decor was warm, cozy and antique which I love.  Exposed walls, original ceilings, old fashioned light bulbs fashioned into unique lighting fixtures, the whole deal (see pictures).   I ordered the garden bagel and my boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast.  He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\\n\\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\\n\\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one!

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

Exposed walls, original ceilings, old fashioned light bulbs fashioned into unique lighting fixtures, the whole deal (see pictures).   I ordered the garden bagel and my boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast.  He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.  The prices were a little steep (which took away from 5 stars) but that is to be expected in this area I suppose.  As long as you come prepared with $30 for two people for breakfast items, then you're good to go!\", 'date': '2014-10-23 16:31:29', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R18] {'review_id': 'dFl7Dl8JghkMrALpyKxTgQ', 'business_id': '9w6o_eyKCSNKgMtAuv6KWg', 'user_id': 'ocFniU3muXVYiwB-ieuMHQ', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'I met some people here at 7:30 AM for a business meeting, and ordered a small latte and a plain bagel.

It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with.

No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, only to discover that the food was below mediocre.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one! I heard some rumors about this behavior before I went there and I was surprised how accurate the description was. The girls at the old place were so nice!

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped. As for the scramble, which in theory sounded amazing, was really lack luster. There was supposed to be fennel in it, but I guess they ran out and decided not to say anything, even though that's why I ordered it in the first place.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nVegan eats= The Suck (and no more whoopie pies= worst) but dont worry, you can buy a $5 cookie.\\n\\nService= Unnecessary attitude city\\n\\nCoffee= overpriced, but great.

That being said, they do brew some delicious coffee, and I'd rather overpay for something I like then get a good deal on something that barely passes as coffee.\\n\\nOne Shot recently moved to a new location on George Street , and that whole place is beautiful. I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.  The prices were a little steep (which took away from 5 stars) but that is to be expected in this area I suppose.  As long as you come prepared with $30 for two people for breakfast items, then you're good to go!\", 'date': '2014-10-23 16:31:29', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 2, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R18] {'review_id': 'dFl7Dl8JghkMrALpyKxTgQ', 'business_id': '9w6o_eyKCSNKgMtAuv6KWg', 'user_id': 'ocFniU3muXVYiwB-ieuMHQ', 'stars': 1.0, 'text': 'I met some people here at 7:30 AM for a business meeting, and ordered a small latte and a plain bagel.

It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason.

No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, only to discover that the food was below mediocre.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one! I heard some rumors about this behavior before I went there and I was surprised how accurate the description was. The girls at the old place were so nice!

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped. As for the scramble, which in theory sounded amazing, was really lack luster.

That being said, they do brew some delicious coffee, and I'd rather overpay for something I like then get a good deal on something that barely passes as coffee.\\n\\nOne Shot recently moved to a new location on George Street , and that whole place is beautiful. I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.  The prices were a little steep (which took away from 5 stars) but that is to be expected in this area I suppose.

It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\\n\\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!  I got a pumpernickel bagel and the whole thing was incredible! delicious to the last bite as was my boyfriends meal.  Perfectly done on both parts, good job One Shot!  I also have to mention the upstairs; quaint, comfy, cozy, and reminiscent of my grandma's living room (in a VERY good way!)  I could have stayed up there all day.  The prices were a little steep (which took away from 5 stars) but that is to be expected in this area I suppose.

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\\n\\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\\n\\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one!

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

It is absolute perfection for a small, intimate affair. (baby or bridal shower, birthday party, special luncheon just because?) From soup to nuts, One Shot and owner Rebecca made it the most splendid, adorable affair.  The whole event went without a hitch, the service was impeccable, friendly and the menu crafted especially for the event was perfection (there was this caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, and a small pat\u00e9 chinois- shepherd's pie - a nod to my french canadian heritage, and the most yummy macarons, amongst other delicious tidbits that were to die for!).   \\n\\n It doesn't hurt that the whole place is so uniquely gorgeous.

When I took my first sip, it was kind of luke warm.  I asked if they could just please pop it in the microwave for me to heat it up a bit.  The woman (I think one of the owners) looked at me with a face of HORROR and spit out her words in disgust UGHHHH!!!!  We don't have a MICROWAVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\\n\\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\\n\\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, only to discover that the food was below mediocre.

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one!

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\\n\\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

It is absolute perfection for a small, intimate affair. (baby or bridal shower, birthday party, special luncheon just because?) From soup to nuts, One Shot and owner Rebecca made it the most splendid, adorable affair.  The whole event went without a hitch, the service was impeccable, friendly and the menu crafted especially for the event was perfection (there was this caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, and a small pat\u00e9 chinois- shepherd's pie - a nod to my french canadian heritage, and the most yummy macarons, amongst other delicious tidbits that were to die for!).   \\n\\n It doesn't hurt that the whole place is so uniquely gorgeous.

I chose the beet juice from the open cooler in the front - it didn't really seem very cold, so I asked if I could have some ice for it.

I am spending $7 for the drink, not to mention the rest of the food we got.  Last I heard, ice wasn't a very expensive item for restaurants to supply. Most will just give it to you for free.\\n\\nAlso, another time it was winter, and I got one of their fancy overpriced hot drink specials on the specials board.  When I took my first sip, it was kind of luke warm.  I asked if they could just please pop it in the microwave for me to heat it up a bit.  The woman (I think one of the owners) looked at me with a face of HORROR and spit out her words in disgust UGHHHH!!!!  We don't have a MICROWAVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\\n\\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \\n\\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\\n\\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

Here's another disappointing cafe experience in Philly.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were excited to come here after reading so many positive Yelp reviews, only to discover that the food was below mediocre. Maybe they were just having a bad day, who knows.\\n\\nWe ordered a simple mocha latte, the ultimate breakfast sandwich on a bagel, and a regular plate of breakfast food items (forgot the menu name). \\n\\nFirst, the ultimate breakfast sandwich: besides the bagel tasting like rubber, the sandwich overall was overwhelmingly greasy. I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \\n\\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \\n\\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte. I can't even remember if it tasted decent or not.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place, but they need to tone it down with the grease and butter. :-( \\n\\nAlso, before I forget, everything we ordered came out to be around $30.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

Exposed brick, wood paneling misplaced over hot pink walls. Super comfy and chic, tufted back bench seating . Overall, really a visual pleasure.

I am really fucking sick of the server/ barista who hates their job, and therefore hates you.. I didn't make you have this job! You can totally quit and get a different one! I heard some rumors about this behavior before I went there and I was surprised how accurate the description was. The girls at the old place were so nice! The barista who recently served me acted really annoyed when my friend and I placed our order. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, it was right from the menu. She just seemed like I was ruining her life by ordering. Whatever lady, I was super nice to you. Maybe next time I could tip you in bug repellent so that nasty one will crawl out of your ass.\\n\\nIts cool, I don't need anymore friends. However, I NEED food, good food.  I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped. As for the scramble, which in theory sounded amazing, was really lack luster. There was supposed to be fennel in it, but I guess they ran out and decided not to say anything, even though that's why I ordered it in the first place.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nVegan eats= The Suck (and no more whoopie pies= worst) but dont worry, you can buy a $5 cookie.\\n\\nService= Unnecessary attitude city\\n\\nCoffee= overpriced, but great.

I really believe that I should be able to order a cup of coffee for less than two dollars. I understand that they offer Stumptown, but the prices for drinks here still seem high. That being said, they do brew some delicious coffee, and I'd rather overpay for something I like then get a good deal on something that barely passes as coffee.\\n\\nOne Shot recently moved to a new location on George Street , and that whole place is beautiful. I met with my good friend Bryana and we sat outside and had coffee and breakfast. Charming 1940s music played inside and out, although Bryana told me this wasn't common. Whether inside or out, the atmosphere is great. Some people send hours in a coffee shop working on papers or other work, and one shot is the kind of place where you will almost enjoy yourself while typing away.\\n\\nThe food menu here is small and hit or miss, but there are a few items that really shine. Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\\n\\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable. Its a pretty place, and is certainly worth at least one visit.

Maybe the system you use to complete transactions wouldn\\'t allow you to process the request - but I find that hard to believe, and harder to believe there isn\\'t a way around that if it was the case...Its not like the kitchen\\'s packed and cleaned up the bagels, or the coffee at 10:01. Its just not the kind of service I would\\'ve predicted from such an otherwise solid establishment - especially when other, closer-to-home coffee shop options are available - doesn\\'t competition drive some sense of flexibility or courtesy to the customer - its Monday morning for all of us, right? $4 for a bagel and 12oz. of coffee is still delivering a substantial profit no matter what time of day you\\'re ordering it. \\nI ended up ordering a tofu breakfast burrito (I\\'m vegan, it was admittedly good), and the coffee is always good (kinda hard to \"F\" up Stumptown brews anyway), but after that experience, my order stopped there.

I mean, how many places can you find that serve a drink like that?! I also stalked One Shot Cafe\\'s instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it\\'s a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\\n\\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week\\'s theme was Hawai\\'i. \\n\\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \\n\\nThe croissant french toast wasn\\'t too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend\\'s breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing.

The woman (I think one of the owners) looked at me with a face of HORROR and spit out her words in disgust UGHHHH!!!!  We don't have a MICROWAVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!

The brioche bun was fairly bland and added little to the overall sandwich while the hashbrown was probably the best part of the entire thing.  Brie wasn't necessarily the best selection of cheese for this sandwich either that lacked a true *oomph* factor.  I was left wanting more in the area of flavor.  I would probably eat this again, but not before trying something different on their menu.  I'd suggest if you're going to One Shot for breakfast, stick to their specials.

No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \\n\\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \\n\\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \\n\\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast. Otherwise, One Shot Caf\u00e9 is my new and improved go to coffee spot! \\n\\nGo follow them on Instagram @ONESHOTCAFE or check out their website at www.1shotcoffee.com\\n\\nYou can follow me @ACARGUY_\\n\\nLink to Photos: https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B09G1CvrSGPns9q\", 'date': '2017-11-02 12:08:33', 'useful': 1, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 2, 'average_stars': 5.0, 'yelping_since': '2017-11-02 11:21:48'}}\n\n## TASK\n\nAnalyze the sentiment drift for the most mentioned staff member.\n\nCompute:\n1.

It was amazing and incredibly filling, well worth $8.\\n\\nFor my second trip, a mere week later, I tried the Oriental Chicken Wrap which came again with lots of chicken and a good helping of almond flakes. The Asian sesame dressing paired well but did have the unfortunate side effect of dripping all over the place and making the 2nd half of my wrap a little soggier than I would've liked. Probably best to stick to creamier dressings in the future since the chipotle mayonnaise for the club wrap was no problem.\\n\\nThere's definitely an office-crowd lunch rush so try to get there before noon or after 1pm.

It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend.

One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.

When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking.

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\\n\\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \\n\\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types.

More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).

Going to NoLibs wasn't an option since I needed to try something new. But that proved to be more difficult than I anticipated since Canvas Coffee Co. which was closest looked to be closed for good. Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \\n\\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it. Score! The vibe and decor of the place was as artistic as it was informative and old fashioned. The couches and main counter had a vintage feel, while it was loaded with plenty of artworks and fliers for local events.\\n\\nSo while it looks like Fishtown might only have one decent coffeehouse (I hope I'm wrong!), at least it's an appealing one that offers a good vibe.\", 'date': '2009-05-28 06:47:29', 'useful': 8, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 7, 'user': {'review_count': 1512, 'average_stars': 4.17, 'yelping_since': '2007-07-13 04:00:59'}}\n\n## TASK\n\nAnalyze rating-text alignment in the reviews.\n\nFor each review, determine:\n- Positive text: Contains positive sentiment words (amazing, excellent, great, delicious, love, recommend, etc.)\n- Negative text: Contains negative sentiment words (terrible, awful, horrible, disappointing, avoid, etc.)\n- Aligned: Positive text with 4-5 stars, OR negative text with 1-2 stars\n- Misaligned: Positive text with 1-3 stars, OR negative text with 3-5 stars\n\nNote: Reviews with mixed sentiment (both positive and negative words) or neutral sentiment are excluded.\n\nCompute:\n1.

I love the interior! Everything on the menu so far has been really good, and I like that it\\'s vegan/vegetarian friendly. I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It\\'s hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend. He actually really doesn\\'t like it here because of the service, but I come back a lot because I love everything else, and it isn\\'t so bad that I can\\'t just deal. \\n\\nTLDR; The ambience and hot drinks are great.

Rocket Cat! Is a niche! \\nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\\n\\nThe answer to that? Just step inside. \\n\\nIf you are a resident to the Fishtown/Kensington hood this will be one of your independent coffee shops of choice. Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren\\'t any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin\\' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\\n\\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \\n\\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\\n\\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.\", 'date': '2014-11-15 19:34:38', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'MLk8kUBApxt3TjPB0A3f1w', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'osXzXSSdIg7F4BBVqZY_gw', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Stopped in Rocket Cat Cafe after a cycling class at the studio across the street and I'm so glad I did! When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\\n\\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \\n\\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \\n\\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\\n\\n\\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too.

More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.

Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \\n\\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it. Score! The vibe and decor of the place was as artistic as it was informative and old fashioned. The couches and main counter had a vintage feel, while it was loaded with plenty of artworks and fliers for local events.\\n\\nSo while it looks like Fishtown might only have one decent coffeehouse (I hope I'm wrong!), at least it's an appealing one that offers a good vibe.\", 'date': '2009-05-28 06:47:29', 'useful': 8, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 7, 'user': {'review_count': 1512, 'average_stars': 4.17, 'yelping_since': '2007-07-13 04:00:59'}}\n\n## TASK\n\nAnalyze cross-aspect patterns in the reviews.\n\nFor each review, identify which aspects are mentioned and their sentiment:\n- food: positive (delicious, tasty, fresh) or negative (bland, cold, stale)\n- service: positive (friendly, attentive) or negative (rude, slow service, ignored)\n- wait: positive (no wait, quick) or negative (long wait, slow, took forever)\n- value: positive (great value, worth it) or negative (overpriced, expensive)\n- ambiance: positive (cozy, nice atmosphere) or negative (loud, noisy, dirty)\n\nCompute:\n1.

I love the interior! Everything on the menu so far has been really good, and I like that it\\'s vegan/vegetarian friendly. I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It\\'s hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend. He actually really doesn\\'t like it here because of the service, but I come back a lot because I love everything else, and it isn\\'t so bad that I can\\'t just deal. \\n\\nTLDR; The ambience and hot drinks are great. Service questionable and often slow, but not unbearable.

Rocket Cat! Is a niche! \\nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\\n\\nThe answer to that? Just step inside. \\n\\nIf you are a resident to the Fishtown/Kensington hood this will be one of your independent coffee shops of choice. Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren\\'t any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin\\' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\\n\\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \\n\\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\\n\\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.\", 'date': '2014-11-15 19:34:38', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'MLk8kUBApxt3TjPB0A3f1w', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'osXzXSSdIg7F4BBVqZY_gw', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Stopped in Rocket Cat Cafe after a cycling class at the studio across the street and I'm so glad I did! When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\\n\\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \\n\\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \\n\\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\\n\\n\\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

My girlfriend also noted that as soon as she came in and asked about ordering she got a \\'long, blank, rude stare\" from the lady manning (lol gender-pun) the counter.\\n\\nIt was like we did something wrong to them or were known dog abusers or vanadlizers or something, literally.  I got that vibe, like I was KNOWN for having done something bad in the community or something.  Sneers, rude curt snips.\\n\\nWhy would I pay money for people to treat me like this and wtf is going on in Fishtown where people are acting like this so much so that report after report says how mean these folks are. \\n\\nI left feeling like they wished I hadn\\'t entered.

More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.

I love the interior! Everything on the menu so far has been really good, and I like that it\\'s vegan/vegetarian friendly. I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It\\'s hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend. He actually really doesn\\'t like it here because of the service, but I come back a lot because I love everything else, and it isn\\'t so bad that I can\\'t just deal. \\n\\nTLDR; The ambience and hot drinks are great. Service questionable and often slow, but not unbearable.

Rocket Cat! Is a niche! \\nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\\n\\nThe answer to that? Just step inside. \\n\\nIf you are a resident to the Fishtown/Kensington hood this will be one of your independent coffee shops of choice. Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren\\'t any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin\\' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\\n\\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \\n\\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\\n\\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.\", 'date': '2014-11-15 19:34:38', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'MLk8kUBApxt3TjPB0A3f1w', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'osXzXSSdIg7F4BBVqZY_gw', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Stopped in Rocket Cat Cafe after a cycling class at the studio across the street and I'm so glad I did! When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\\n\\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \\n\\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \\n\\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\\n\\n\\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

The atmosphere was really cool, people scattered around, some chatting, some working on their Macs, others reading. Typical coffee shop vibe if its a good coffee shop, which it was.

There were ceiling fans, but they do little when it is already 95 degrees.  I thought maybe the AC was broken, but looked around and didn\\'t see any vents or units, so I assume it doesn\\'t exist.

The girl told me huffily that \"We have a system here.

I am used to waiting some time at Rocket Cat so I decided to use this time productively and walk across the street and go to the local deli to make a purchase. After waiting for the traffic light and crossing Frankford Ave. twice, going into the deli, having a short (small talk) conversation with the deli owner and making a purchase I returned to Rocket Cat.

More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).

I love the interior! Everything on the menu so far has been really good, and I like that it\\'s vegan/vegetarian friendly. I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It\\'s hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend. He actually really doesn\\'t like it here because of the service, but I come back a lot because I love everything else, and it isn\\'t so bad that I can\\'t just deal. \\n\\nTLDR; The ambience and hot drinks are great.

Rocket Cat! Is a niche! \\nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\\n\\nThe answer to that? Just step inside. \\n\\nIf you are a resident to the Fishtown/Kensington hood this will be one of your independent coffee shops of choice. Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren\\'t any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin\\' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\\n\\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \\n\\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\\n\\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.\", 'date': '2014-11-15 19:34:38', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'MLk8kUBApxt3TjPB0A3f1w', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'osXzXSSdIg7F4BBVqZY_gw', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Stopped in Rocket Cat Cafe after a cycling class at the studio across the street and I'm so glad I did! When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\\n\\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \\n\\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \\n\\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\\n\\n\\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

It took sort of long to get my food, a little too long. but I think they were backed up or there was something holding up the process and they told me it would take a while in advance so it\\'s not like I was kept waiting and not knowing what was going on. \\n\\nRocket Cat also often has art openings on first fridays which are pretty cool and the vibe here is pretty good.

Few minutes goes by and I check back with her while she\\'s waiting to use the the bathroom. I say \"Hey, what did you order?\" she replies \"Just a coffee, why\" I then remark \"Oh ok, just making sure, guess they\\'re brewing a new pot or something.\" As we finish up our conversation a patron who had been using the bathroom has now exited and she proceeds to enter the restroom. Only to be confronted with the stench and appeal of a ports-john after pointless fest (google it) that has been festering under the hot summer sun all damn week. And let me go on to say the two of us are not delicate or yuppies by any stretch of the imagination. With that said she let me know that she would just wait until we stopped somewhere else along the way. After that we both walked back up to the counter after finding the guy who she ordered from was just sitting down to eat a sandwich at the counter he had just prepared for himself. When I looked confusingly around for her coffee and then said \"Hey, hows the coffee coming?\" he looked up and said \"Huh, oh I totally forgot\" (oh did i mention the cafe was not busy and no one else had ordered before or after us) he then shuffles behind the counter and pours a cup from the first pot he comes to and hands it to us, with this disdained look like we had interrupted him, then headed back to his sandwich.

The cafe mocha was tasty as was the conut.  A welcome treat on a nice day.\\n     \\n     The decor is hard to explain. Its kind of arty/kind of old student house shabby but in a good way. An example is their bathrooms, which have what appears to be handpainted signs with \"Onion\" and \"Garlic\" on them. There is plenty of character as opposed to the sterile corporate interior design of Starbucks or some of the other chain stoors. The cafe has nice wood floors and plenty of seating. Decoration/paintings here and there. Lots of colors. Good music on the stereo, though today it was mostly \"Juno\"esque/grrrl rock(which the server was singing to. She wasn\\'t half bad either).  There is a soda fountain type curved bar area where you can sit on stools which is kind of cool.\\n      As far as computing goes,Rocket Cat had an old Blue Mac G4 for you to check e-mail/stuff on the internet.

I want to like it, but time after time I feel let down.  Today I met some friends there and although we were having a great conversation, we had to leave after 45 minutes because it was stifling and humid inside the cafe.  There were ceiling fans, but they do little when it is already 95 degrees.  I thought maybe the AC was broken, but looked around and didn\\'t see any vents or units, so I assume it doesn\\'t exist.  Sure, it can be considered a luxury, but not in an establishment where you are expected to spend any extended period of time.  \\n\\nThe service can be slow and if you don\\'t know the drill there you can end up feeling like you don\\'t belong.  One time, after ordering and waiting for my drink, I tried to pay at the far end of the bar instead of near the cash register because a new crowd had gathered and was blocking the register.  The girl told me huffily that \"We have a system here.  You need to pay over here.\"  Instead of her taking my money and walking the 2 feet, I had to \"excuse me/pardon me\" through the crowd to get there.  To her.  I felt embarrassed for being so stupid.

Yesterday I went in and ordered a latte. Paid for my drink ($5.05 plus a $1.00 gratuity.) I am used to waiting some time at Rocket Cat so I decided to use this time productively and walk across the street and go to the local deli to make a purchase. After waiting for the traffic light and crossing Frankford Ave. twice, going into the deli, having a short (small talk) conversation with the deli owner and making a purchase I returned to Rocket Cat. There was no one in line so I walked up to the counter and said \"excuse me I ordered a latte.\" Before I even finished my thought the barrista grunted \"Yah.\" while staring at me confrontationally. I tried to explain myself and said \"I just walked across the street..... Once again the staff member jumped down my throat and said \"She had other orders.\" I wanted to try and explain that I just was inquiring as to whether or not my order had been completed, but then the other barrista chimed in \"that\\'s the way it works\" in a snotty childish voice.

This would have been kind of tasty if I wanted a peanut butter latte.  But I didn't.  The mochaccino was a bit muddy.  The regular iced coffee is totally adequate, but nothing special.  Iced mochas need sugar but are pretty yummy once that has been taken care of.  The Thai Iced coffee is truly where they shine.

Free wireless and plug-in's but, as with Leotah's, not at all coldly laptopp-y in feel.  And like Leotah's, this place has a beautifully alternative feel that seems to be far too short in supply in Philadelphia.  Although Rocket Cat is a genuine cafe in the sense of it's being expected that many people will simply come here for coffee and writing/surfing, the owner (or proprietor?) seems to take a kind of quiet joy in customizing items as casual as a bagel-with-avocado, or a simple sandwich, to the appetite of the eater.  More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).  It was just a bagel with avocado!  But she made it great.

I got up and informed the two young ladies at the bar about what happened, and I got the brush off with them saying \"Oh no! We will look into that\" then turning away from me.  What would have happened if I had not put my tea down before? I could have been severely burnt! Right away I started having some back pain which has gotten worse since I left.

Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse).

It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend.

Rocket Cat! Is a niche! \\nHow many hipsters can resist?\"\\n\\nThe answer to that?

Being one of the only out in this art revival scene of the Northeast part of Philly. There aren\\'t any Starbucks or other coffee chains besides a Dunkin\\' here and there but if you want to be able to get free wifi and finish that report due this friday goodluck b/c this part of town lacks that besides the trendy Northern Liberties...\\n\\n...but who really has five bucks for a cup of organic cat pooh coffee that is hand-washed by Virgin tears, then blessed by the Tibetan monks before being flown over seas by Nordic Gods flying flaming chariots being pulled by singing cranes? \\n\\nRocket Cat is a nice middle ground for fair coffee in the middle of a sprawling neighborhood of artists, families tied in ethnicities of all nature. One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

It's not hard to actually say the reason- the place itself is interested, unique and fun to look at.  I love the indoor plants and the fact that it seems very homegrown in there.  We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.  During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \\n\\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\\n\\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.\", 'date': '2014-11-15 19:34:38', 'useful': 4, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'user': {'review_count': 73, 'average_stars': 3.75, 'yelping_since': '2012-04-05 13:48:30'}}\n[R4] {'review_id': 'MLk8kUBApxt3TjPB0A3f1w', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'osXzXSSdIg7F4BBVqZY_gw', 'stars': 5.0, 'text': \"Stopped in Rocket Cat Cafe after a cycling class at the studio across the street and I'm so glad I did! When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area.

Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

One time, after ordering and waiting for my drink, I tried to pay at the far end of the bar instead of near the cash register because a new crowd had gathered and was blocking the register.  The girl told me huffily that \"We have a system here.  You need to pay over here.\"  Instead of her taking my money and walking the 2 feet, I had to \"excuse me/pardon me\" through the crowd to get there.  To her.  I felt embarrassed for being so stupid.  ( I was also  6 months pregnant and SITTING AT THE COUNTER!)  \\n\\nFinally, I understand they have a monopoly in the neighborhood, but the prices are very high.  See for yourself.   If you want any kind of specialty drink, you will have to start at around $3.95 for a small.  It doesn\\'t matter if it has simple or complex ingredients or if they can make the batches in bulk and in advance.

Yesterday I went in and ordered a latte. Paid for my drink ($5.05 plus a $1.00 gratuity.) I am used to waiting some time at Rocket Cat so I decided to use this time productively and walk across the street and go to the local deli to make a purchase. After waiting for the traffic light and crossing Frankford Ave. twice, going into the deli, having a short (small talk) conversation with the deli owner and making a purchase I returned to Rocket Cat. There was no one in line so I walked up to the counter and said \"excuse me I ordered a latte.\" Before I even finished my thought the barrista grunted \"Yah.\" while staring at me confrontationally. I tried to explain myself and said \"I just walked across the street..... Once again the staff member jumped down my throat and said \"She had other orders.\" I wanted to try and explain that I just was inquiring as to whether or not my order had been completed, but then the other barrista chimed in \"that\\'s the way it works\" in a snotty childish voice. Then she STARTED to make my order. I decided to just shut up and go back outside and wait.\\n\\nWhoever owns this place please take note of all the negative reviews placed previously to my entry.

Free wireless and plug-in's but, as with Leotah's, not at all coldly laptopp-y in feel.

Although Rocket Cat is a genuine cafe in the sense of it's being expected that many people will simply come here for coffee and writing/surfing, the owner (or proprietor?) seems to take a kind of quiet joy in customizing items as casual as a bagel-with-avocado, or a simple sandwich, to the appetite of the eater.  More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).  It was just a bagel with avocado!  But she made it great.

When I came back to sit down, I put the tea on my table then sat in the chair, and it suddenly went backwards and stopped at an angle. I thought at first that I had broken my chair, and tried to get up when I realized I was stuck at an odd angle. As a bigger person, I was at first extremely embarrassed about the situation, though honestly i\\'ve NEVER broken a chair before in my life! When I looked down I saw that the leg of my chair had fallen into a HOLE in the floor. Not the side of the floor against the wall, the side of my chair in the middle of the floor!

I got up and informed the two young ladies at the bar about what happened, and I got the brush off with them saying \"Oh no! We will look into that\" then turning away from me.  What would have happened if I had not put my tea down before? I could have been severely burnt! Right away I started having some back pain which has gotten worse since I left.

Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \\n\\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.).

And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it.

Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.

When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\\n\\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\\n\\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \\n\\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options!

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them!

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \\n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \\n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

Free wireless and plug-in's but, as with Leotah's, not at all coldly laptopp-y in feel.  And like Leotah's, this place has a beautifully alternative feel that seems to be far too short in supply in Philadelphia.  Although Rocket Cat is a genuine cafe in the sense of it's being expected that many people will simply come here for coffee and writing/surfing, the owner (or proprietor?) seems to take a kind of quiet joy in customizing items as casual as a bagel-with-avocado, or a simple sandwich, to the appetite of the eater.  More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).  It was just a bagel with avocado!  But she made it great.

I was at a table with my friend and I got up to get a refill on my Tea. When I came back to sit down, I put the tea on my table then sat in the chair, and it suddenly went backwards and stopped at an angle. I thought at first that I had broken my chair, and tried to get up when I realized I was stuck at an odd angle. As a bigger person, I was at first extremely embarrassed about the situation, though honestly i\\'ve NEVER broken a chair before in my life! When I looked down I saw that the leg of my chair had fallen into a HOLE in the floor. Not the side of the floor against the wall, the side of my chair in the middle of the floor! It took  another patron to help get me up. The other patron said to me that the same thing had happened to him recently. I got up and informed the two young ladies at the bar about what happened, and I got the brush off with them saying \"Oh no! We will look into that\" then turning away from me.  What would have happened if I had not put my tea down before? I could have been severely burnt! Right away I started having some back pain which has gotten worse since I left. I also now have a headache. I tried to find an e-mail address for the owner but I couldn\\'t. I will be going to the doctor on monday to get my back checked out.\\n\\nI think the worst part of this embarrassing experience is that the people behind the bar didn\\'t even do so much as to ask if I was ok? And I wasn\\'t sitting in an out of the way table. That hole is dangerous. I also noticed one around the pipes on the other side of my table. I will continue to try and contact the owner of the shop. \\n\\nThis was not my first time at Rocket Cat, and before this I have enjoyed it. The food is good, the people are usually friendly, and their tea doesn\\'t suck which is a rarity in this area. I won\\'t be going back though, because of the attitude of the baristas.

Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \\n\\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it.

I love all their hot drink, esp their creative lattes, and their cold drink selection is awesome, too.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the service, while not necessarily \"rude\", is kinda off-putting? It\\'s hard to explain, but it always seems like placing an order is an inconvenience to the cashier. It\\'s not the same person every time, either, so maybe it\\'s just the mood/shtick they\\'re going for??\\n\\nAlso, whether I\\'m the only one there or not, it almost always takes 5-10 minutes to get my drink. While not a big deal, it does prevent me from considering Rocket Cat as a morning stop before work: every \"quick drop in\" turns into a much longer visit. \\n\\nThese have been problems consistently every time I\\'ve gone to Rocket Cat, alone or with my boyfriend.

One of the key things I like about this part of town. It still holds to it\\'s roots and if you look beyond the hate, thugs, and crime that hang around here, there is a beauty to this relic. Most of the neighbors, even some you wouldn\\'t expect are friendly. \\n\\nYes, Rocket Cat, may have some clientele that resemble some you\\'ve seen at Chapterhouse or the Green Line or Last Drop with their self-importance attitude but where there\\'s fair trade coffee and vegan cookies; there\\'s going to be some douchy people lining up. \\n\\nOne of the great things about Rocket Cat is it\\'s space. It\\'s very wide and plenty of room to stretch out. No worries of tripping over someone\\'s laptop charger or over-hearing obnoxious conversations of some really cool house party no one cares about. Plus you can sit at the counter, much like a bar and get up-close service. \\n\\nMost the baristas are friendly, especially if you get to know them. Just start a conversation and you\\'re bound to get a decent response from them other then some places where you\\'ll get...\\n\\n\"Uhhhh... I\\'m sorry but I only talk to people that look like American Apparel models and know everything David Byrne ever did\" \\n\\nSometimes you might wait awhile for service but it\\'s still worth it and it adds to how this is truly an independent establishment and not some mass-transit machine chain like other coffee places.

We would get coffees all the time from this place and I would even say we became fairly regular here.  Aside from them only taking cash (which became a huge drawback because we barely ever carry cash on us and had to actually think about this before we would go there), it was also very close to our place and we often walked or biked there in no time.

Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \\n\\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \\n\\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \\n\\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on.

Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \\n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \\n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \\n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \\n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \\n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \\n\\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.

I will be going to the doctor on monday to get my back checked out.\\n\\nI think the worst part of this embarrassing experience is that the people behind the bar didn\\'t even do so much as to ask if I was ok? And I wasn\\'t sitting in an out of the way table. That hole is dangerous. I also noticed one around the pipes on the other side of my table. I will continue to try and contact the owner of the shop. \\n\\nThis was not my first time at Rocket Cat, and before this I have enjoyed it. The food is good, the people are usually friendly, and their tea doesn\\'t suck which is a rarity in this area. I won\\'t be going back though, because of the attitude of the baristas. Was it so hard to ask if I was ok, and not giggle and say \"oh no!\"?', 'date': '2012-09-29 23:54:54', 'useful': 6, 'funny': 9, 'cool': 1, 'user': {'review_count': 14, 'average_stars': 3.6, 'yelping_since': '2011-10-12 20:12:42'}}\n[R20] {'review_id': 'Q-IUXIqsYBU0U4vdigpZvg', 'business_id': 'BqvKbM7EOI0jXs0G-h2C9g', 'user_id': 'bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA', 'stars': 4.0, 'text': \"After getting a styling and  profiling hair cut at Plume I was seriously in need of appeasing my daily coffee fix. Going to NoLibs wasn't an option since I needed to try something new. But that proved to be more difficult than I anticipated since Canvas Coffee Co. which was closest looked to be closed for good. Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \\n\\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it. Score! The vibe and decor of the place was as artistic as it was informative and old fashioned. The couches and main counter had a vintage feel, while it was loaded with plenty of artworks and fliers for local events.\\n\\nSo while it looks like Fishtown might only have one decent coffeehouse (I hope I'm wrong!), at least it's an appealing one that offers a good vibe.\", 'date': '2009-05-28 06:47:29', 'useful': 8, 'funny': 3, 'cool': 7, 'user': {'review_count': 1512, 'average_stars': 4.17, 'yelping_since': '2007-07-13 04:00:59'}}\n\n## TASK\n\nAnalyze the sentiment drift for the most mentioned staff member.\n\nCompute:\n1.
