# ALLERGY SAFETY POLICY EVALUATION

## Goal
For each restaurant, decide an automated action for peanut/nut allergy safety using its reviews.

## Action Space
Output one of: ALLOW, WARN, BLOCK

## Evidence Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
1. You may output BLOCK only if you find at least 2 independent first-hand reviews within the last 2 years that describe a severe allergic reaction after eating at the restaurant.
2. For every review used as evidence, you must output: the review_id and a short quote from the review that supports the claim.

## Conservativeness Rule
If reviews conflict and you cannot resolve the conflict confidently, choose the safer action (WARN over ALLOW, BLOCK over WARN).

## Output Format
For EACH restaurant, output in this exact JSON format:
```json
{
  "restaurant_id": "<business_id>",
  "restaurant_name": "<name>",
  "action": "ALLOW|WARN|BLOCK",
  "evidence": [
    {
      "review_id": "<id>",
      "quote": "<relevant quote>",
      "date": "<review date>",
      "relevance": "<why this is evidence>"
    }
  ],
  "policy_rule_applied": "<which rule led to this decision>",
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
}
```

## Current Date for Reference
Today is 2024-01-15. Reviews within the last 2 years means reviews dated 2022-01-15 or later.

I'm not sure) listening to a gramophone on the side of a building.  The mural makes me incredibly happy, and, since I live right off of Girard, I get to see it every day.  However, they serve La Colombe, which makes everyone happy except me.  I don't know what my damage is, but I don't like it.  There are very few p...

If you realize that statement is a compliment, then you should definitely give it a try.  I love the unpretentiously hip atmosphere and  neighborhood feel.  I had the intention of having one of these highly praised egg sandwiches but the tomato/avocado/cucumber/cream cheese bagel sounded and tasted delicious.

Milkcrate Cafe is cool little place, with decent seating for enjoying coffee and the food that is made there. We couldn't even look at the food after over doing is so much at Sketch. However the menu and the dishes we saw looked really good and unique. We ordered two ice coffees and Milkcrate brews and serves La Colombe coffee. ...

It's the kind of place you walk into at 10 am on a Tuesday morning and encounter a dozen seemingly unemployed young people milling about in pilled beanies and delightfully soiled flannel. Why am *I* getting cappuccino at 10 am on a Tuesday morning, you may ask? Erm, let's stick to the topic at hand.

I mostly love this place. 8 times out of 10, my large cappuccino is awesome ($4). Those other two times, I'm not sure what happens. Too many grounds in the portafilter? T...

I'm disappointed most of the time, seriously. I pray a new bagel place opens up that is closer.  Also a smile might help from behind the counter. Cool place and I'm a big supporter of local shops. But they should double check their orders when busy in the morning.

If I'm hungry, I go for the Notorious E.G.G. - a bagel egg and cheese sandwich...with added avocado.   It's really hard to find a good egg sandwich around Philly these days and I must say that Milkcrate's is one of my favorites.  Coffee is decent, not amazing, but gets the job done.

Atmosphere- Alot of independent shops have a filthy, overcrowded vibe with just "too much" going on.

Breakfast burrito is very tiny with beans and kinda blah. Also there is only one coffee brewed and it's kinda watered down. Better to brew your own than pay $3-4 for their coffee.  Don't mean to knock this tiny place, but the food and coffee just doesn't stand up to what you can get elsewhere.  Place isn't bad but I've definitely experienced better.

For example, I ordered a sausage egg and cheese with tomato... received egg on bread and was charged for all the additions.

Sometimes you want to experience an upscale vibe but nothing flashy. You're not trying to be difficult, it's just how you feel. For those nights, Tria is just the scene you might be looking for.

- Text: I am hopeful that FSC will become a five star favorite of mine, but for now not so much. I've been clamoring to try it and was so excited that we finally had a Saturday available for brunch. 

First, it's gorgeous. They took their time with this place and it shows. I'd go back just for the building. I definitely want to sit in the garden and have coffee drinks, and cocktails, and dinner. But for now the main vibe I got from the place was coldness. It was a recurring theme.

Our server was disint...

- Text: We originally wanted to go to One Shot Cafe the day we came here but we were not disappointed at all.

The decor and atmosphere is great! Really comforting, especially when coming in from the cold outside. As soon as you step in, you're greeted by a large lobby and bar that serves tea, coffee, and smoothies. We got teas while we waited which were fitting for the cold weather (green jade blossom).

When being seated, the area is quite small but packed. There's a homey feel to it as everyone is ha...

- Text: Ambiance: Absolutely Gorgeous! Very roomy and the outdoor garden is very beautiful on this 70 degree day for brunch. 

Service: (3.5/5) I went today (4/21/2019) for Sunday Brunch with a party of 5, my GF's cousin put her name down with the hostesses (there were two of them, a male and female) and we waited. As 20 minutes went by, she went back to check and the hostess got a little hasty and just tossed the mini-clipboard menus down as if we were in the wrong when she sat us down at our table. Ou...

- Text: This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Philly. I'm vegan and brought my friend who is extremely allergic to dairy to try French Onion Soup for the first time in her life and she was so excited. She almost immediately started having a reaction so we asked our server if it was made with real cheese by mistake. Next thing we knew the manager came over with a prepared monologue about how much they respect the vegan diet and how they would never intentionally cause someone to break their m...
