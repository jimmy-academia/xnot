We couldn't help but go twice while we were visiting. The chargrilled oysters were hands down the best I've ever had. We also had the shrimp poboy which was delicious, filling and not lacking in flavor in the slightest. There's a reason they h...\n[R3] 2.0\u2605 | Love the food, but was treated like an inconvenience by not only the wait staff, but also the management - even after spending money there. Part of what makes a place special are the people - and this place loses in that category. If you're looking to be treated kindly - don't go. But I'm sure they ...\n[R4] 5.0\u2605 | I know there's a long line, but, seriously, wait! Don't leave. I highly recommend and will be back again the next time I'm in New Orleans.

I would recommend ACME if you're looking for a nice place to eat i recommend you eat here. If there is a line its worth the wait...\n[R10] 5.0\u2605 | This was the first place we ate at upon arriving in New Orleans. The wait to get in was definitely something (we arrived on a Friday night) - but the hour or so spent waiting for this was absolutely worth it! We also made some new friends in line. :)\n\nThe oysters were succulent and grilled to perfec...\n[R11] 4.0\u2605 | I always stop here when visiting. The wait was not long. It was 2 of us so they sat us pretty fast. We ordered and food came out in roughly 10 minutes. I tried the hot sausage po boy this time with a side of gumbo. It did taste good but a part of my bread was hard. I will be back if visiting again....\n[R12] 2.0\u2605 | overpriced  and small portions. definitely  a tourist  trap....\n[R13] 5.0\u2605 | One of the BEST oysters that I have even had!! The raw oysters are boom.\n\nI do like the raw ones better. The chargrilled ones kinda have the butter garlic take away the favor of oysters. We ordered more after the first round. Definitely recommended. Worth the 40 minutes of wait for us....\n[R14] 4.0\u2605 | Great place for a beer and some pretty good fried fish.   Chargrilled Oysters were fantastic....\n[R15] 3.0\u2605 | For a place that came so highly recommended, we were actually pretty disappointed. We ordered the fried crab claws, fried crawfish, the oysters and the acme special poboy. We sat at the bar because the place was full and those were the only seats available, which we didn't mind. The issue is that th...\n[R16] 2.0\u2605 | We were recommended here for the Charbroiled Oysters. They were never available for order. We kept waiting and waiting until finally our waitress said they weren't coming. The gumbo was ok, not much flavor or much seafood in it. My husband ordered etouffee but when it came out it looked just like th...\n[R17] 5.0\u2605 | Outstanding is all I can say....oyster so fresh and the shrimp is to die for.... Just great nice environment...\n[R18] 5.0\u2605 | I wanted to try everything, but settled on the charbroiled oysters (12), raw oysters (12), fries, and hush puppies. Everything was DELICIOUS!

But overall everything was good...\n[R22] 5.0\u2605 | If you have never been to New Orleans, and you want a taste of what this city offer, I suggest you come here! Mind you, the wait will be ridiculous, but worth it. I'm not even an oyster kind of girl, but Acme Oyster House is the ONLY place I will tear some oysters up! \nThe staff shows that great sou...\n[R23] 5.0\u2605 | Love it here. The service is always good. I love the oysters here raw and cooked although this last trip they were more burnt then just cooked. Gumbo is excellent I believe after my son had 3 bowls.  friends seafood platter was also very good and tasty. I recommend this place for ther oysters indeed...\n[R24] 3.0\u2605 | The chargrilled oysters were decent. Everything else was just okay. The service wasn't bad, but not sure that I'd go back and get anything else. Also, after a certain the crowd seems to give more daiquiri shop vibes....\n[R25] 5.0\u2605 | I'll keep it simple. The was the best place I ate at in New Orleans when we went there for vacation earlier this year in February. We touched down in New Orleans from California around 8 o'clock at night, and this was the first place we went to after dropping our bags off at the hotel. We ordered 3 ...\n[R26] 3.0\u2605 | A lot of people recommended this place but it was a bit of a let down after trying other places in NOLA. The po'boys were good. They were flavorful and not too greasy. The meat pies were also really good. That was our first time trying them. However, the chargrilled oysters were not great. We though...\n[R27] 3.0\u2605 | My least favorite restaurant I have tried in New Orleans. \n\nOrdered an appetizer for my meal since my main reason for visiting was to try banana foster for the first time. My shrimp appetizer wasn't that great. (Maybe I should of ordered oysters at oyster house). The shrimp appetizer is something th...\n[R28] 5.0\u2605 | It doesn't get any better than Acme. Several years since I was here last but still amazing. Sit at the bar and watch the counter person open oysters and then sample his great work. Our dozen raw oysters were huge, sweet and delicious. Our dozen grilled oysters were hot and topped with wonderful garl...\n[R29] 1.0\u2605 | I had a really bad experience here. Came to New Orleans for Southern Decadence. This was the first restaurant we eat at. I ordered a shrimp po-boy. I had a couple of big bites out of it. I thought it tasted funny, so I looked at the shrimp. They were gray. Uncooked. I have never experienced such bad...\n[R30] 5.0\u2605 | Worth the hype! Saw the line the first day i got in town and decided to try other oyster houses. By Sunday i decided to wait in line. Lord! Over never had oysters this good before. Suck it up  and stand in line it's worth the wait...\n[R31] 4.0\u2605 | My dad and I came here for some authentic Louisiana food. We are not big fans of southern fried food so this cuisine is not our favorite but we wanted to try the authentic flavors.  The gumbo was really great. My dad got a po'boy and I ordered the Louisiana sampler which was Jambalaya, sausage and g...\n[R32] 5.0\u2605 | Wow, I'm going to start by saying wow! The food was delicious. Hubby and I had the Jambalaya Medley. To die for, the fried alligator is amazing!!! Must try.  We had Hurricane for drinks and jack and coke. The drinks are strong, over all great for you back.  We had to wait in line but  it was worth t...\n[R33] 5.0\u2605 | The wait was down the street for a table but we sat at the bar and got right in. Came in specifically to try the soft shell crab and got to watch oysters being shucked the whole time we waited. Very cool experience....\n[R34] 5.0\u2605 | So worth the little stroll. We had a great server. I said surprise me for my main course. New Orleans sampler. Wow!! Mouth heaven. Mouth watering. Shared with my daughter. We were stuffed. Lucky we walk everywhere in New Orleans. Never worried about the extra calories. You can take your beer to go....\n[R35] 3.0\u2605 | I don't know if this place is worth the hype. Yes, the oysters were outstanding. But the place was dark and filthy and the rest of the food we ordered (po boys and gumbo) were mediocre at best.  My roast beef po boy came and there was gravy slopped all over and under the plate.  It was good for a on...\n[R36] 5.0\u2605 | We have been waiting to have the grilled oysters for over 10 years and we are pleasantly surprised they're just as good as our memories. The crab cakes are highly recommended,  as well as the gumbo and the etouffee. \nFor dessert we tried the pecan cobbler and the bread pudding and both were excellen...\n[R37] 4.0\u2605 | A nice pub-style restaurant for sampling different kinds of food!\n\nThe portion was not big but good enough for you to have a taste of it. We enjoyed the grilled oysters the best, very cheesy and buttery! I don't like oysters in general but I love it a lot! Some sand in some of them though, wish it c...\n[R38] 5.0\u2605 | Delicious. It's a tiny joint, and they sure know how to pack it to the breaking point, but the food is 100% worth it. The chargrilled oysters, soft shell crabs, and French fries smothered in roast beef debris is what makes life worth living for these days. This place is a New Orleans institution, an...\n[R39] 5.0\u2605 | I hate standing in lines for anything. Today, I was lucky that lunchtime, Acme had no line!  This was my 4th oyster stop on this trip to New Orleans - and was absolutely the best!\nThey are still checking the vax card with a valid ID at the entrance. Face coverings are still required.

The place is small, it has a table bar and lot of tv's to watch sports, the food is very good and the waiters very kind and attend very good...\n[R42] 4.0\u2605 | ACME oyster house has been pretty consistent every time I visit. The chargrilled oysters are among the most known and it's for a good reason! These buttery, crispy, garlicky, wonders are fresh and full of flavors. \n\nI ordered the gumbo and it was tasty. I did have better gumbo at Red Fish but this o...\n[R43] 5.0\u2605 | Acme is the best restaurant for charbroiled oysters. I've had charbroiled at Drago's, Mr. Ed's and Morrow's. Acme Metairie wins - hands down! The oyster bar staff is by far the most engaging and quite funny I might add. They are very clever in their way of upselling to more food and drink as well....\n[R44] 5.0\u2605 | The char boiled oysters are a must. Had the Acme Poboy. There maybe a small wait if going with a group but for single to two you can sit at the bar.

They have been around for over 100 years and the reason is because the food is that great. Their oysters are what they are known for. There are no reservations so you have to get there and get in line until they sit you...\n[R48] 4.0\u2605 | Amazing as usual. Must have the broiled. All seafood is very fresh. Sizes are huge! You won't go away hungry. Only negative was the wait and how they selected who got in...not first come but on size of party..and they all must be there when they call you. I get it covid...but it was a bit of time an...\n[R49] 5.0\u2605 | This place makes me feel like I was back home in Jersey. Dimly lit, delicious aromas and football playing on the television.

Hit the spot especially with a beer and American mule!! Needed to save...\n[R52] 5.0\u2605 | I wasn't able to dine at ACME on my last visit. The lines were so long. But this time, when I arrived, there was a long line. I told the host that, I was alone and if there was bar seating available. He went to check and BAM! I was seated. Everything on the menu looked so delicious. And let me tell ...\n[R53] 5.0\u2605 | Fantastic oysters and service. Ask for Garrett to be your server. Our group ordered a dozen of the grilled and a dozen raw paired with some Anita beers. They serve other dishes there too but we went for the oysters only. Enjoy!...\n[R54] 5.0\u2605 | This is always one of my go to places when in New Orleans or Destin Florida the food is always consistently good.  The charbroiled oysters are a must and the onion rings are delicious. Don't leave with out trying the bread pudding it is delicious....\n[R55] 5.0\u2605 | My GAWD, the char broiled oysters we're heaven!!!

F...\n[R56] 5.0\u2605 | These were the best oysters I had in New Orleans.\nI usually go for the raw oysters but I'm now converted thanks to Acme Oyster House.

The Chipotle Tabasco go great with the oysters as recommended......\n[R61] 5.0\u2605 | I love the Acme Oyster House, but with over 7,500 reviews, there is not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  So I'll keep it short, and just touch on the highlights. \n\nSome people complain about long lines.  We were fortunate and did not have a line.  But even if there is a line...the food...\n[R62] 5.0\u2605 | Just an amazing experience. The staff there take so much pride in their product and delivery. On top of that the food is great. Tried some raw oysters, chargrilled oysters and craw puppies. Theres a good reason why this place has existed for over 100 years...\n[R63] 3.0\u2605 | We were recently in Gulf Shores, AL and decided to go to Acme Oyster House.  Of course, being a cajun restaurant, they use cajun seasonings.  I have food allergies, so there was very little I could eat.  However, my husband had the gumbo, and he said it was very good.  The management was very kind t...\n[R64] 5.0\u2605 | Another must-try spot just off Bourbon Street in the French Quarter.  Full service, sitdown restaurant.

Fast and friendly service!\n\n...\n[R65] 5.0\u2605 | This is a must try place in the French Quarter. We had excellent service from Audrey. The prickly pear margarita was amazing.

Very busy for dinner and very loud! \nPrices are good as well....\n[R67] 5.0\u2605 | We got the Shrimp po boy, and char grilled oysters - and if you're not an oyster person you will be after eating these. Gumbo was delicious. Wasn't sure what to order and waitress suggested the char broiled oysters and they were fantastic. In fact they were so good We had to order more. So delicious...\n[R68] 3.0\u2605 | Acne no longer feels authentic to me.  My oysters were good, but the fries were cold, they never refilled my ice tea (on a hot day!) and seemed more interested in turning the table over to a new customer before we had even finished our food....\n[R69] 5.0\u2605 | Casual good eats!

First, the party in front of us \"couldn't find their vaccination card\" and kept \"looking\" for it. Instead of refusing them entry they still let them in. Then once seated didn't want one part of a sampler and wanted something substituted.  They ...\n[R76] 4.0\u2605 | I didn't have a terrible experience, however, it's wasn't the best either. In my opinion the restaurant simply didn't live up to the hype. I'm honestly not sure why it's highly recommended because their wasn't anything on the menu that stood out from other places I've visited.

In New Orleans they almost always have a line down the street but it's a great spot to chat with your friends and family as you get ready to eat.
