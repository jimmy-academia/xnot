I got the seared tuna which was delicious, but could have been served on top of a salad or something. The rabbit and dumplings was delicious, but needed more duck....\n[R2] 4.0\u2605 | We had a lovely time dining at Cochon. Unfortunately, it didn't start lovely. We arrived right at 7:15, our reservation time, and had to wait until 7:30 to be seated. According to the rude podium princess, they had to seat all the 7:00 reservation first. Since we were the only ones waiting, we didn'...\n[R3] 5.0\u2605 | Fantastic NOLA experience. Great curation of unique foods that are quintessentially southern, creole, and Cajun. Would recommend to any discerning foodies....\n[R4] 4.0\u2605 | Great and friendly staff, overall the food was good, but missed somewhat. The special we had, the Cochon, we felt was just lacking something. The fried oyster BLT was good as was the smoked fish dip and Mac and cheese casserole. Was a good time for lunch. If you go, get a reservation....\n[R5] 5.0\u2605 | A creative and upscale restaurant doing inventive things with southern food and pork. This place was pretty acclaimed and regularly busy so we made a reservation a few days ahead of time. We sat outside on the patio. Service was helpful and accommodating with questions, but seemed like they were spr...\n[R6] 5.0\u2605 | Lunch here was great!  My friend and I shared the Fried Pork Shank and it was AMAZING!  The outside was crispy delicious skin and the inside meat was moist and juicy.  The sauce seemed to be a honey glaze served with fresh Cilantro and Mint.  The mix of the herbs with the honey were perfect with the...\n[R7] 4.0\u2605 | Our experience at Cochon was pleasant. Service was quick and food was delicious. Drinks are also well crafted. The oysters on garlic chili oil was a winner\n\nThe alligator was different. If you don't mind eating alligator then it's probably good.  Just not for me.\n\nThe pork neck meal was well made ac...\n[R8] 3.0\u2605 | In the industry we call this a OYRU!  (official yelp review update)\n\nSo back in the day this place was all that...  2013-2015 era...  It was on Anthony Bourdain... you couldn't get in the place.  I initially visited there in 2014 I think...\n\nI remember having a good experience, not great.  But wante...\n[R9] 4.0\u2605 | First stop in New Orleans and it was a pretty good one. Oysters were amazing and that sauce it comes in is heavenly. It's a garlic butter sauce that goes along well with the bread. Also got the pork belly, but at that point it was getting a little too savory for me. The fattiness of the pork belly r...\n[R10] 5.0\u2605 | Excellent customer service. They are social distancing the tables which is a nice change compared to other restaurants. The food was delicious. We ordered the wood fired oysters which were absolutely delicious and the Louisiana Cochonwhich was tender, juicy  and flavorful. The service was friendly p...\n[R11] 4.0\u2605 | Delicious food and cocktails. We enjoyed a very nice, leisurely dinner. \nHowever, the unpadded wood chairs proved uncomfortable....\n[R12] 4.0\u2605 | My grandsons and I had lunch here the other day and I was pleasantly surprised with one of the best gumbos I have ever had. It was chicken and sausage with a dark Cajun road just the way I like it. Their take on a crawfish pie was also really good but the star of the show where the free mini buns ho...\n[R13] 4.0\u2605 | Great environment. Great, unique food. Only downside is small volume cocktails for the cost of them....\n[R14] 5.0\u2605 | There is a reason Cochon is on every list of top places in NOLA. I started with the whiskey flight which was only 25 dollars! Great price. The wood fired oysters was a great choice for appetizer, the garlic sauce it came with was amazing for also dipping bread. My wife had the smoked porkchop which ...\n[R15] 5.0\u2605 | We came here and the first thing we were asked was,\"Do you have a reservation?\" We didn't abut they had just opened for they day and they were kind enough to make one for us. For appetizers we ordered the fries alligator with was interesting. I had never had it before and the best thing I could say ...\n[R16] 5.0\u2605 | Awesome food. Boudin and wood fired oysters on point. Especially dipping house made bread into chili butter. Braised short ribs were amazing...\n[R17] 5.0\u2605 | From start to finish a 5/5 experience. Brandy and the other hostess were friendly and accommodating at the door.

Love love love!!  Coincidentally, a special client of mine was having a pre-wedding event here so I asked Cochon to assist me in surprising her with a nice bottle of wine.  Every time I called to coordinate this the front of the house staff wa...\n[R19] 1.0\u2605 | Not a friendly or helpful business. The hostess rudely told us leave and go across the street to a more family friendly restaurant. Maybe I'm seeing things wrongly but that to me is considered DISCRIMINATION towards me and my family. But it's probably my mistake for thinking they were a business try...\n[R20] 5.0\u2605 | Awesome seafood and fresh water cuisine available, it's heaven for pescatarians like me...\n[R21] 5.0\u2605 | Get a reservation before you read the rest of my review.\n\nCochon was a restaurant suggested to my boyfriend and I by a few friends, a few travel books, and a few locals we talked to while we were visiting New Orleans. It's clear why... this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long w...\n[R22] 4.0\u2605 | Great casual dining restaurant. The food was delicious.

Good, but nothing special....\n[R25] 5.0\u2605 | Omg sooo freaking good. Had the New York strip (gluten free) and it was wonderful. Almost licked the plate too bad people were watching so had to control myself. Hubby got the ham steak with succotash and it was awesome (gluten free also), I did finish his. Great selection of whiskey and bourbon, ha...\n[R26] 5.0\u2605 | Cochon has become our go to! We love the service and the food, We feel comfortable there and always have a good evening under their roof! Can't say enough about the dishes they serve and the service!:)...\n[R27] 3.0\u2605 | We came here to try the fried alligator which we haven't had before. It literally just tastes like chicken. The gumbo was good but the mac and cheese was the best dish, along with the greens coming in second. Our experience was true when it comes to the server can make or break your restaurant. \n\nWh...\n[R28] 4.0\u2605 | Fantastic dinner with a wonderful twist on Creole dishes.  Ensure you try the Wood-Fried Oysters With Chili GarlIc...go ahead and order extra bread...trust me.... Friendly staff and great service!...\n[R29] 4.0\u2605 | Cochon was a tasty and unique take on NOLA food. We enjoyed sampling Cajun staples (such as gumbo and catfish) as well as trying some funky Louisiana dishes, such as fried alligator. Service was incredible. \n\nAn additional star would have been given for better atomosphere and some healthier options ...\n[R30] 2.0\u2605 | The bread is delicious, it is given when asked.  Everything is a la carte, servings are small not enough to satisfy wish they were not just a taste.  Very expensive!...\n[R31] 5.0\u2605 | Beautiful place and great staff. I had a steak that was perfect and Gumbo was delicious. Make reservation they fill up quick...\n[R32] 5.0\u2605 | It's New Orleans so it's no surprise that everything was full flavor. I would recommend the rabbit and dumplings, delicious!\nI also tried the boudin balls and pork & bacon pie. Just lovely! I'll definitely be back. \nIf you're diving, there are nearby paid parking lots and there's street parking....\n[R33] 5.0\u2605 | Such an amazing time last night. Jeff, Mike, and Aaron--the bartenders-were quite efficient. Jeff was my main bartender and he was so friendly. Sit at the bar, if you can. This is where the magic is! One of the managers Jacob came to check on me as I had made a reservation. It was a very thoughtful ...\n[R34] 5.0\u2605 | I thought I was out of luck without a reservation for lunch, but I made a phone call and the waitress just wrote me in. I entered and it was pretty empty on the weekday.\n\nI ordered the alligator bites and fried boudin balls, loved both. The alligator bites I guess can be demeaned to better versions ...\n[R35] 5.0\u2605 | Their rotating entree of chef's choice pork specialty never fails to impress. The brined, smoked, and grilled ham steak on offer when we were last there was the most delicious, outstandingly prepared cut of pork I've ever tasted. This is not a kiddie, quick-eats sort of place. Plan to slow down a bi...\n[R36] 5.0\u2605 | Perfect dining in New orleans. Wood fire kitchen is super great. That make everything delicious. \n\nFor Gulf fish, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Also, tody's cochon, Porkbelly was amazing. Crispy outside and juicy inside and summer corn. \n\nThey have good wine lists and hard liquors.\n\nI should c...\n[R37] 1.0\u2605 | Drove a couple hours to try this place and they wouldn't let me eat here because I was a party of 1.  Plenty of open seats indoor and out.  Don't go here solo.  They did nothing to accommodate.\n\nUpdate: I went back to see if they do takeout (which was never offered), and they did so I went to the ba...\n[R38] 5.0\u2605 | Service was amazing, decor was pleasant and omg the drink names were so creative! My partner and I visited the gem before hitting the road back to FL. From the moment you walk in you can smell the savory smells of meat. I enjoyed everything but especially the oysters and corn salad. I can definitely...\n[R39] 5.0\u2605 | I started with the Huckleberry beer (Trail Dog Tangerine Wheat). This was a heavier style, and I would say better tasting, of a tradition Blue Moon beer. \n\nFor dinner I chose the fried catfish  with grits, sweet pepper salad, cured pork, and chili sauce. Who would've thought that mint leaves would'v...\n[R40] 5.0\u2605 | Absolutely outstanding service and food!  Delicious cocktails.  The grilled oysters and their pot liquor were incredibly tasty.  The fried boudin is perfect.  The ham steak has a smokey depth of flavor that is a whole new experience in eating pork. These guys know what they are doing!...\n[R41] 5.0\u2605 | We went to eat at Cochon our first day visiting New Orleans. It was the perfect introduction to all the delicious creole food! All the dishes we tried were so flavorful and delicious. The wood fired oysters were incredible, I had never had oysters like that! Also, it was my first time trying fried a...\n[R42] 5.0\u2605 | What a great choice for lunch. Walking distance from my hotel in the warehouse district.  Sat at the bar sampled the grilled oysters (amazing) with the best fresh baked rolls. Gumbo was delicious.  Had the chili dusted Cracklin and the a great piece of carrot cake. A touch pricey but worthy of the p...\n[R43] 4.0\u2605 | Food here was only so-so... we got gumbo, which was decent. Alligator for appetizer which was also okay. But the fish plate was not good- it was so salty and soggy for some reason. We had to send it back. But the manager came by and apologized and offered to remove it to make things right. That was ...\n[R44] 5.0\u2605 | Probably the best restaurant I went to during my brief visit to New Orleans, which I maintain, is a terrific food city, one that rivals or sometimes tops New York City. We had dinner here during my brother's bachelor party weekend, and I think the entire group of like, a dozen of us guys ordered pre...\n[R45] 5.0\u2605 | All of the food, wine, and dessert was amazing! The fried alligator was a must-have. Our waitress was nice too. Would definitely recommend!...\n[R46] 5.0\u2605 | Absolutely amazing food. Seated quickly although it was not busy when we arrived. Waiter was amazing, I wish I remembered his name but even as the place grew busy he didn't slow his service to us. Food was incredible, pork belly was perfectly done and the skin was absolutely delightful and crispy. O...\n[R47] 5.0\u2605 | Literally the best meal we had in New Orleans.

The best part of the evening was the service - everyone was nice and professional! We had higher expectations about the drinks and food however we were a bit disappointed wishing there was a nicer twist of flavor and presentation. We tried the 1lb Cochon, cucumber salad, ...\n[R49] 5.0\u2605 | Yassssssss everything was so flavorful!!!! The alligator was interesting- my first time having that and I would try it again. The Rabbit and dumplings was sooooo good !...\n[R50] 5.0\u2605 | Ratings\nFood 10/10\nService 10/10\n\nEverything about this place was excellent, had a unique flavor, and provided the best Gumbo in New Orleans we have tasted....\n[R51] 4.0\u2605 | I visited this place with 3 others for the first time.  The restaurant itself is really nice. The menu is compact and initially I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I ordered the Woodfire Oysters, the Oyster Sandwich and the pineapple upside down cake. The Woodfire Oysters were delicious. I just wi...\n[R52] 5.0\u2605 | Delicious food. The rabbit and dumplings was perfect. Filet was well seasoned and tasty. Boudin balls were delicious too. Nice pour on cocktails. We didn't try dessert....\n[R53] 4.0\u2605 | On every trip to New Orleans, we try to avoid all touristy restaurants and focus on simple, great food. Cochon has a very cute, woody vibe.

I wish they still had their charcuterie plate option, but quality and taste is tip top!...\n[R55] 5.0\u2605 | My boyfriend and I went here on my last night in New Orleans and I was upset he didn't take me sooner!

I have a shellfish allergy and the waiter was kind enough to tick off all the ...\n[R56] 5.0\u2605 | Best place we ate at in New Orleans. \n\nAlligator was great. Pineapple upside down cake was great. Oysters were great. Wish we had room to eat more pork. \n\nGood cocktail menu. Really friendly fun staff. Nice decor and cool clientele. Very reasonable priced for the quality and amount of food. \n\nI had ...\n[R57] 3.0\u2605 | Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by my dining experience here. I was expecting it to be good from the high reviews but really just mediocre. They also hold a card for reservations ($25 penalty for no shows/late cancellations).\n\nThe cochon came lukewarm, the corn on top was cold. The meat was pretty ...\n[R58] 5.0\u2605 | This was one of my favorite meals while visiting New Orleans, so much so, that I decided to go back again just before my flight home.   They followed all COVID protocols, staff were friendly, provided great service, and food was delicious. Can't ask for much more.  My favorite dishes were the Bacon ...\n[R59] 4.0\u2605 | Nice leisure atmosphere, wait staff friendly and helpful, main course underwhelming for the price, the Cochon was lukewarm in center, maybe I ate too slow, bourbon flight was nice though....\n[R60] 5.0\u2605 | Best charbroiled oysters!! You can dip the bread in the sauce for a little extra. Love the smell of smoke in this restaurant. It's a must when you're in NOLA!...\n[R61] 3.0\u2605 | Definitely a must for Nola! The food was very, very delicious but unfortunately the service was terrible that evening! Super slow and our server was confused and inattentive. We ordered the pig's head and obviously weren't nearly close to finishing it but wanted to pack it and bring it back for late...\n[R62] 4.0\u2605 | Cochon (not to be mistaken for Cochon Butcher next door) is a solid place to grab dinner.  The ambiance is fun.  The staff is friendly.  The food is generally tasty but not everything on the menu is a solid base hit.

The portion size was good and the flavors were also very good. Definitely recommend making a reservation prior to going!...\n[R69] 4.0\u2605 | Tried Cochon for the first time on a Friday night and not disappointed. Snagged a last-second reservation and was seated in the large back dining room. Pretty noisy with two big parties near our table, but all that faded away when the food arrived.

I can't wait to explore the rest of the deliciousness on the menu!...\n[R72] 5.0\u2605 | If you go to the WW II Museum, this nearby restaurant (2 blocks away) is a must. We had lunch there and it was delicious: fried oyster & bacon sandwich (unimaginably tasty) and a green salad. Reasonably priced, good service, excellent fare....\n[R73] 4.0\u2605 | Been here multiple times over the years. With the amount of good food in NOLA, that says something. Inventive and fresh....\n[R74] 5.0\u2605 | We ordered almost every appetizer on the menu and everything was fabulous. Other people in our party ordered the red fish and they said it was great. Would definitely return here when we are in the Big Easy.  Great staff too....\n[R75] 5.0\u2605 | MAN OH MAN DO I HAVE A LOT TO SAY!!! This was my 2nd time trying it and BOTH times it was phenomenal.

Located in the heart are...\n[R76] 4.0\u2605 | Great food in a relaxed, modern location. Prices seem to be on the higher side by NOLA standards, but being from the Boston area, these prices are more what I am used to.\n\nFor food, I had the gumbo, fried gator, and wood-fired oysters. For drinks: the Ramblin Rose and the Elevation.\n\nThe gumbo was p...\n[R77] 5.0\u2605 | A pleasant surprise of a place after a day at the museum; an easy five minute walk.

So damn awesime....\n[R82] 5.0\u2605 | Hands down the best food in Nola. So good, went back a second night. The rabbit and dumplings has to be number 1 item, followed closely by the spare ribs. Was part of a group and we all did family style so we could taste everything. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes....\n[R83] 5.0\u2605 | I came for lunch with a group of 8 for lunch.  The space itself was great and had a nice warm/homey feel to it.  We started off with bacon/pork pie and fried boudin. Fried boudin is a cajun meatball with rice and pork in it. Both starters were so delicious.  We were fighting over the leftovers and d...\n[R84] 5.0\u2605 | Out of all the restaurants I've tried during my week in New Orleans, Cochon was the best.  I should have gone back to try the rest of the menu.  For my drink, I got a lemonade.   It was house made and refreshing.\n\nTo start, we had beautiful warm bread rolls with butter.  They were like King's Hawaii...\n[R85] 3.0\u2605 | I agree with a previous review that stated nothing was wrong but nothing was great.

Often have my birthday dinner here with a large group. Never a disappointment, always a pleasure. Can't wait to return!...\n[R87] 4.0\u2605 | Good, but not great. We enjoyed the dishes but nothing was a wow. Seemed to be coasting and not trying for fresh ideas and imaginative....\n[R88] 3.0\u2605 | Unfortunately Cochon has definitely gone downhill since we last ate here. For what you pay, the service is quite sloppy, and the food is somewhat lacking.\n\nFor example, our server forgot to review the beef/fish/pork options on the menu when she was taking our drink order; we didn't get bread until l...\n[R89] 5.0\u2605 | Service was awesome, great drinks, the grilled oysters were wow!!!!!

I'm sure it's easy to to dupe clueless tourists with this \"elevated\" Cajun/creole food, but if you've spent any time living in Louisiana you'd probably agree that charging $14 dollars ...\n[R97] 5.0\u2605 | I love, love, love this place and it's sister restaurant Peche. This is probably a top 5 meal I have ever had.\nI just finished work late, the place was recommended to me. I sat alone at the bar and ordered alligator bites which were the tastiest.
