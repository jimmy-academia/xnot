I usually go for a mushroom burger but instead opted for their guacamole bacon burger. It's served on an onion ciabatta roll which did not add anything to the burger except for an overly hard texture, especially when paired with the dry burger patty. The guacamole could have used some more seasoning and the thick-cut bacon was okay. \n\nThe fries that came with the burger were salty and soggy; my husband commented that they were likely old. There was a good amount of other customers in the restaurant , so I'm not really sure why there would be old fries unless they cooked huge batches of them in advance (maybe to keep up with their promise of \"endless french fried potatoes\"?). The sweet potato chips we had as an app were fresh and also a favorite with my family, so I'd suggest getting the chips instead of the fries. \n\nFrom the prices on the menu (around $9 for burgers), you'd think that the food would be good or at least a notch higher than \"decent\". Not so at Cheeseburger in Paradise.\n\nP.S. I had to change a diaper while there and the changing table was inside the handicapped stall.

The problem for me, was that if a particular food item is displayed in your restraunts name, it better be damn good. These burgers weren't paradise, they were simply average. They have some decent burger toppings ( I myself got a bleu cheese and onion straw burger, which was decent but not wow) but I was surprised to see that the CheeseBurger in Paradise burger was simply a cheeseburger...served with a pickle. \nTo go along with that, the fries were blah, McDonald's shoestring sized yet not even as crispy, laying somewhat limp on the plate. I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) \n\nUpon being sat, the song \" Cheeseburger in Paradise\" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. \n\nThe tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her \"adult\" status to ask for one.. \n\nI didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were \"freaked out\" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. \n\nOverall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains.

Salads were good though croutons on the Caesar salad appeared to come out of a bag. Pizza Delicious actually does a better Caesar.

A beautiful looking loaf of bread appeared that was hot and crusty only on the top. I tasted little to no garlic and ended up with a loaf of cold bread. Only the top crust had any hint of crustiness or garlic. It was not served with butter or oil, so essentially we ended up with a dense loaf of bread that was nothing but plain. I know these guys can do better than that. How about partially slicing the loaf and placing garlic butter in between? We left the entire loaf behind with the exception of the top crust. My husband loved the puttanesca and said it would be hard not ordering it again; he loved it that much. The meatballs were also perfect. I had the cioppino. It was served hot and was a decent size.

The pumpkin pie latte is also good, and I hear the chai hot chocolate is a treat too. The toasted marshmallow latte is quite sweet though, just to warn you. For a cold option, I like the coconut frap .. it's nice and light, not too sweet. You can switch between cold and hot for most of these options though.\n\nI've always found their pastries to be delicious and never stale, unlike other coffee houses. The lemon swirl is to die for, if you like a strong lemon taste -- lots of flavour in every bite, with chunks of chewy lemon. Yum! The cinnamon swirl and chocolate croissants are also tasty.
