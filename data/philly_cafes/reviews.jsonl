I called early afternoon Saturday to get in for two that evening around 6:30. Host explained he could get us in at that time in the downstairs area, but not in the dining room upstairs. I was fine with that because it was our first time. My family grew up in Italy and has raved about the food and authenticity! \n\nThe downstairs is where the gelato, coffee bar, other pastries, sandwiches and such are. Generally an area where you can come in and out more quickly than having a sit down dinner, which is what we came for. Aside from that, it is a very pretty ambience. Italian music playing, many songs I grew up listening to which brought me back. \n\nThe waiter explained that each week they chose a region of Italy and create dishes pertaining to that region. One thing I particular looked forward to was the knowledge of staff pairing wine and food as I heard that's what they do. Unfortunately, our waiter did not suggest any wines after we said we were ready to order, but unsure what wine to choose. Our waiter educated us on the man who travels around to hand pick each wine for the restaurant, only to walk away giving us a few more minutes to decide on our own. Hm. \n\nOk now for food! Began with classic Italian starters of arancini, rice balls with beef, sauce, peas and cheese, and fritto misto, basically fried calamari with additional fried shrimp and zucchini. Both presented nicely and well cooked. \n\nWe had to order our main dishes with gelato pairings. We went with the ravioli with the back and white truffle gelato and crabcake with red pepper gelato. I was happy with both dishes. My boyfriend thought the ravioli was more al dente than he preferred, but I actually enjoyed the texture. Truffle is very distinct in this dish, so you have to like it if you're going to appreciate the combo with the gelato. I thought the cool gelato complimented each dish nicely. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the brioche gelato sandwich with tiramisu gelato and the sfogliatelle. My boyfriend loved the sandwich and I really liked the texture and taste of sfogliatelle with ricotta filling. It is not a particularly sweet dessert, but very tasty. Only complaint was that the sfogliatelle was supposed to come with whole milk gelato, but it did not. I did realize it after it was served to me, but I did not say anything to the waiter because I suddenly wasn't sure if I was mistaken. Later I checked the menu and they did in fact forget to serve the gelato with my dessert :( Also ordered espresso ristretto, which just means it is stronger. Don't be surprised if it looks like a sip of coffee in a regular size cup. This is the traditional Italian way. \n\nService was fine, but nothing too great. I am wondering if it would be a different experience in the actual dining area. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious. The gelato is out of this world (we sampled a few more on our way out) tremendously full of flavor, but what else could you expect from the gelato champion?!

The Negroni was too heavy on the vermouth and had a full orange slice (a proper Negroni has a burned orange peel to bring out the oil in the skin).  The Aperol was missing the prosecco and bubbles.  We sent them both back and asked to have them removed from the bill, and ordered wine instead.\n\nI started off with the prosciutto de parma and speck alto adage pgi plates.  Both were served in identical fashion, thin strips laid over a salad and on a wooden cutting board.  The salad had a purplish and thick dressing on it, resembled a balsamic like flavor, but way too sweet and overpowering for the light side salad.  It also had green olives in it that didn't fit the flavor profile.  At $9.50 per plate, this was way overpriced.\n\nThe \"Salumi Sushi\", I had the Friuli dish, prosciutto and strawberries wrapped in a roll and then sliced down like a sushi roll, a balsamic reduction in between.  Not a bad dish, but at $11 for the dish, it was again a little overpriced.\n\nThe Fritto Misto was average, but not what I was expecting for an authentic Italian restaurant.  The calamari and zucchini were good, but the shrimp were the really small previously frozen kind and ruined the dish.\n\nThe mozzarella dish was buffalo mozzarella, we chose \"caprese\".  It was 1/4 of a ball of mozzarella, then cut into 4 smaller pieces and placed at the corners of the plate while a tomato/green olive/pine nut mixture dominated the center of the plate.  At $11, I expect a whole ball of mozzarella (a ball of buffalo mozzarella costs $6 wholesale).  Huge failure here.  Just go to Di Bruno's down the street and get a full cheese serving if you're after a cheese plate.\n\nNext up was their \"ROME\" special of the week.  The waiter explained that they picked a different region every week and featured dishes and wines specific to that region.  I opted to try the Spaghetti Carbonara.  What I received looked good, except for a scoop of bacon gelato on top.  The pasta itself was slightly overcooked, missing that slight \"thickness\" that properly cooked pasta in Italy has.  Maybe they're just using cheap boxed pasta instead of making it fresh?  The sauce was too much egg and not enough liquid, maybe by removing the bacon from the dish, they lost the bacon fat which kept the sauce thinner?  Combine the cool pasta temperature and the cold gelato on top, this dish was a huge failure.\n\nThe parmigiano ravioli also came with gelato on top.  This was supposed to be yellow tomato with basil but it tasted like some form of mango (and way too sweet).  Again, the cold gelato on top of the lukewarm pasta was an unpleasant combination.  The ravioli's were also overcooked and I'd swear they were a prepackaged and previously frozen pasta.  We ate one bite and left the dish.\n\nThe meal at this point was so disappointing, we skipped the post dinner espresso and the gelato they're famous for.  The check came to a shocking $180 with the tip, and we would have been hungry except for the pains in our stomach from the unpleasant meal...\n\nThe interior space is very nice looking.  We were told it was made in Italy, and then shipped here for assembly.  Impressive...but what would have been more impressive, and more effective, would have been to bring over an actual Italian chef instead of serving what tastes like pre-packaged pasta and foodservice prepared foods.", "date": "2015-01-07 16:50:51", "useful": 12, "funny": 4, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 439, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2012-07-04 13:19:17"}}

I tried to cut this short but just couldn't so stick it out, read on, and enjoy Gran Caffe'!\nSince the Caffe' opened in December, I don't think I've missed a week (it is conveniently near my office)  so I've tried a lot of food, beverages, and desserts on the menu and I can't say enough about it.\nWhen you walk in you can completely suspend reality and pretend you are right in Italy. The decor is gorgeous and it is set up downstairs just like an Italian Caffe'. The upstairs elegant dining room continues the effect with Italian books on the shelves. Then when you take a sip of espresso, you will really think you have flown to Italy! This coffee, in my opinion is the best in America...imported and roasted right on the premises.  The Italian wine menu is so thorough, extensive, and varied and the prices are amazing for Center City. \nNow on to the food. This is true blue from Italy Italian. No fettucine alfredo here!!! The food is so fresh that I've tasted foods here that I can otherwise be a little leery of eating. I haven't had a bite of anything that wasn't delicious. There is always a weekly special menu highlighting a certain town in Italy. Everything is so unique. A couple of my favorites were the Florentine steak (served on a cutting board-very creative) and the pici which because it is hand rolled it is very hard to find on a menu here in the US. The pasta is all hand made in house and incredible. I also had a Food Network moment with a warm melon dish where my tongue was tasting the whole spectrum of flavors which I always thought was so funny on those competition shows and now I know it can happen. I can't say enough about the time and care put into the recipes and the execution.  On the standard menu the gnocchi melt in your mouth and the zuppe di pesce makes one of my friends want to stand up and applaud the chef! The eggplant parmigiana is perfect. The crab cakes are also a treat. Then there is the gelato, made by the World Master (really, no joke). This gelato is better than any I tasted in Italy. Each type is so saturated with fresh flavors that you think you are eating the actual food it is named after. The pistacchio tastes like the actual nuts, the fondente tastes like a delicious dark chocolate bar, you get the idea. So many flavors to choose from also. It is truly an art.\nThe wait staff work hard and do a great job in a big place with 2 floors to serve. Shout out to Rob, Matthew, Taka, Agnieszka, Sam, and Luciano is at the bar! You can even come here for cultural classes and an occasional Italian karaoke night. So, if you need a moment in Italy and can't get there right now, head over to Gran Caffe', you won't be disappointed!

I visited on June 9, 2018 and chose this since it was in close proximity to my hotel in Center City. I met two ditzy hostesses that body checked me in the weirdest manner and led me all the way to the back of the restaurant after telling them I wanted coffee and a snack. It was around 11AM and there were only three parties in total sprawled across the restaurant. Strike 1: what makes you think I want to sit in a dimly lit area when it is bright and 80 degrees outside?\n\nThey told me to go all the way in the back, so I oblige since I'm hungry. I wait and the blond waitress with a bun refuses to acknowledge us. She glares and looks pissed and angrily questions, \"Do you plan to order or something?\" Strike 2: she watches us sit, stares at us, refuses to initiate conversation, sees us looking around for a menu, senses our confusion, and when she does approach us, she gives the nastiest attitude. Sorry for thinking you could serve me? Like what?\n\nWe tell her we're waiting to see a menu. At this point, she questions why we didnt get one. I'm baffled at this point. Instead of giving us one, she goes to the hostesses only for one of them to come back to make a point about getting coffee? It was intrusive, and only added to my level of discomfort. Strike 3.\n\nThe waitress returns and throws a single menu at us. A single menu for two people. Strike 4.\n\nThis was the most uncomfortable experience. Everyone there was white and my skin is tan. It was cold and uninviting since the moment I came in. I left after she threw the menu. Before leaving I had taken a look at my surroundings. The people at the bar were conversing with the patrons seated there. The hostesses were nice to lighter skinned people. Our waitress just didnt want to serve brown skinned people, since it's apparently so beneath her. \n\nI called to speak with a manager and was interrogated so much before I finally was able to. The people working there realized how big they screwed up, and the hostesses were prying so hard to figure out who I was and why I need a manager. Ned, the manager, apologized and told me to give them another chance. After reading the lower ratings for this place I am certain this place needs to address why its staff treats darker skinned people so poorly in comparison to its caucasian customers. \n\nIts 2018. If you're still branded as a racist in America then I wish you luck, but you are not going to see any good come out of this.", "date": "2018-06-13 03:16:17", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 44, "average_stars": 3.11, "yelping_since": "2014-12-20 19:50:42"}}

First, when you walk in, it is confusing where you should go. It looked like downstairs was the gelato shop so we walked upstairs only to be brought back downstairs to the hostess. It was not obvious that this is what we were supposed to do. Once being brought back upstairs to sit down we were immediately greeted by our server.\nI have to say that these poor servers look a little ridiculous in their Pinocchio hats and suspenders. Once I got past that, it took the server sooooo long to explain what the history of the restaurant and the idea behind the menu was. In my opinion, if you have to do a lot of explaining, then maybe the concept needs to be revisited so it is more clear. Is it small plates? Is it for sharing? Are you supposed to order items from several different areas of the menu? Will this be enough food? Who knows, it was all very, very confusing.\nAlso, our waiter was annoyingly attentive. He left so we could look at the menu and came back two or three times before we had a chance to make up our minds. He stood like six feet away while we discussed what we thought might be good and interjected every once in a while with some information or opinions. It was uncomfortable, I have never had a waiter do that before. \nWhatever the waiter said to us in his long explanation was lost on us. We ended up looking at it from a more traditional stand point. We ordered an appetizer, some dinner salads and an entree. I eavesdropped when the table next to us was ordering and it seemed like they were equally confused asking if that was going to be enough food and if they had ordered correctly.\nAnyway, now to the food. We thought we had ordered lamb skewers to start but four shrimp in a spicy barbecue like sauce were brought to our table. There must have been something lost in the translations. We didn't say anything and ate it. They were plump and tasted great. My salad was large and had a bunch of some bitter vegetable in it and a weak citrus dressing. I mostly picked around and left about half of it. For the entree I had the branzino fish plate. It came with asparagus and roast potatoes. This dish was altogether delicious and I enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a scoop of cafe gelato. Best gelato I have ever had. It was so good, if I had not been so full I would have wanted more. \nIt is a bit of an expensive meal. It was $96 before tip. If our waiter had not been such a weirdo and there was less confusion I think I would have scored higher based on the food.", "date": "2016-01-10 21:13:14", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 72, "average_stars": 3.42, "yelping_since": "2015-05-10 03:28:48"}}

The two? three? hostesses looked really confused, but then told us they were going to seat us upstairs in a few minutes. My friend told them we only wanted desserts, and then they looked confused again. They said upstairs seating is for dinner only, no desserts. Since there was an empty table about 10ft away from us, we asked if we could just have that table and bring a chair over. And again, they're still confused. We were about to go grab a chair and bring it over ourselves, but one of them managed to do that.\n\nSo we're kind of sitting there, ready to order about 15 minutes ago, while the hostesses are just standing there 10ft away from us dillydallying. My friend gets up to go to the counter/bakery case to order our desserts since no one was doing their job, then a waitress finally appeared to take our order. We told her that he was already over there ordering, and she asked if we were dining in or taking out? We said dining in. So she runs over to the counter to tell those guys that my friend, who is ordering at the moment, that his order was for dining in.\n\nA few minutes later, my friend's Macedonia was brought to us. It's basically a fruit salad with a lot of juice and a small scoop of gelato served in a small sundae glass. A couple more minutes go by.. maybe 10-15, and our other desserts haven't come. The waitress has completely disappeared and we didn't even have water during this entire time. At this point, we're tired of waiting and decide to leave.

Pasta that was Al'dente, flavors that were the real thing.  Eveything done as if one where in Italy.\nThe second time, we brough friends who were just delighted as were we.\nThe third time we came with more friends and loved it all.\nThe fourth time, not so much, but hey anyone can have an off night.\nThe fifth time, when I saw the addition of the ubiquitous dessert tray, I knew that instead of remaining true to Italy, they were trying to assimilate to American tastes.\nLast night 3/14/15, we arrived at 6:15.  We had to wait for a table upstairs. Yes, and those stairs. Only for the fittest and waiters transfer food from the downstairs kitchen, up the stairs, to your waiter.  It passes through many hands before you get it.\nWe had to wait a long time for everything.\n\nOn a Saturday night, at six PM, our waiter's station had not been supplied with plates or silverware!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy husband ordered soup, and I was delighted to see Blue Points on the menu.\nI asked the waiter how many oysters were in one order.  He said \"six.\"  There were five on the plate and he said that sometimes he sees six on a plate and sometimes five. I thought those things should have been settled in the kitchen and made known to the servers.\nThe chef had adulterated the oysters with flavors and something sweet so that it taste like anything but oysters. Because I said I expected oysters, the owner sent up another five.  Yes, they were plain with adulterated cocktail sauce but were not the taste of great Blue Points.

My wife also went with a Gelato pairing, but not from the Verona menu.  She got the Agnoletti al tartufo with a black and white truffle gelato.  Both were great.  \n\nI didn't know what to get for my entree, but I went with the Veal Saltimboca.  It was the perfect thickness and had a great taste.  A nice sage and wine sauce accompanied it.  I love veal and it's not always great, but this place does it right.  The wife got some duck breast with blood orange.  I enjoyed the skin, but mine was definitely better.  \n\nFor drinks, we both went with the Sgroppino, which had lemon sorbetto mint, some lemoncino vodka and prosecco.  It was light and refreshing.  After our meal, I enjoyed a shot of espresso with chocolate and mint.  My wife ordered a cappuccino with caramel sauce.  To finish the meal, we both enjoyed two scoops of Gelato.  We held some discussions prior to ordering and I advised against trying to mix flavors.  Sometimes you can get too creative and it just doesn't work...  We were offered the choice of mixing flavors and might as well throw all logic out...  I mixed the chocolate covered Strawberry with the dark chocolate gelato, while my wife also had dark chocolate, but with cherry.  Both were so smooth and delicious.  Fantastic gelato.  \n\nEveryone was just so friendly here and patient.  I think the manager came over three times to us.  My major complain was that I am assuming my wife's family was sitting directly behind me, because there was someone who kept on sneezing so incredibly loud during their meal.  Great service and food.  Can't be better than that.

As soon as we sat down and the waiter started-in with his spiel I got a bad vibe. A bit of that \"pretentious\" vibe. The host who greeted us (a really nice and genuine fellow) did so with a few Italian words mixed-in, with an authentic accent, and I thought he was Italian. Then I hear him across the room revert to a normal American accent. What? What was that show of Italian language for? It just felt contrived, that's all.\n\nSo our waiter brings us menus and explains them, and we now understand that many of the prices we had previewed on Yelp were for \"tapas-like\" portions. That's why it seemed inexpensive. But we stay.\n\nThe waiter: \"Any questions?\"\nWife: \"Yes -- between the (listed entree), the (listed entree), and the (listed entree)...\"  [looks at waiter]\nWaiter:  \"What's the question?\"\n\n(Strike one.)\n\nWife:  \"Which is your favorite?\"\nWaiter then seems to struggle with recommendations.

She said it was interesting, but I would have thrown it out rather than eat it, and I'm in love with all things pasta. \n\nSo, to sum it up, I didn't experience a 4-1/2 star restaurant.

Just the other day, I found an excuse to pop in for some gelato. This versatile establishment is amazing for a fancy Italian dinner, a casual cafe meet-up, or (as I've just discovered) ordering delivery!\n\nDINNER/UPSTAIRS: My boyfriend is a huge fan of Italian food, so I was searching around on Yelp for a romantic, upscale (but not TOO expensive) Italian restaurant to treat him at for his birthday. The great Yelp reviews brought Gran Caffe L'Aquila to my attention, and several other online listings dubbing it one of the most romantic places to dine in Philly sealed the deal. You'll definitely need a reservation if you plan on dining upstairs. We were seated promptly by the pleasant waitstaff. They were so thoughtful and accommodating - I wasn't totally satisfied with where we were seated, so the hostess moved us to a nicer place in the courtyard. However, she noticed that it was quite loud, and offered to move us (before we had ordered anything) to a different area. Our waiter was also excellent. Service definitely sets Gran Caffe L'Aquila apart.\n\nFood-wise, we had the decadent Italian meal we were hoping for. We started with Fritto Misto, which is calamari jazzed up with some shrimp and zucchini. Portions are a bit smaller than your typical Italian eatery, but that's in conjunction with stellar food presentations to reflect an upscale, fine-dining feel. The Fritto Misto was just enough to whet my appetite for our beautiful pastas. We opted to order from Maestro Biasini's Gelato Pairings, \"culinary specialties paired with savory gelato, prepared by the Italiant Gelato Champion\" - super unique, so obviously we had to try! The Carbonara w/ Bacon Gelato is the dish topped w/ the bacon spiral I'd been eyeing via Yelp - did not disappoint, there's a reason there are so many pictures of it! The savory Bacon Gelato was more of a frozen heavy cream that melted and stirred in. My personal favorite was the Agnoletti al Tartufo - veal/pork stuffed ravioli w/ black and white truffle gelato (because truffle makes everything better). Again, the gelato is meant as more of a cream/sauce, but this one was served w/ about a teaspoon of white truffle oil in the middle. Because the gelato melted slowly, we were able to enjoy the creamy ravioli without being overwhelmed by the truffle flavor - genius!\n\nFor dessert, we finished with the Affogato (a scoop of ice cream in a shot of espresso) and White Chocolate Brioche Banana Bread Pudding. Both are usually served with Fior di Latte gelato (i.e. Milk/Plain), but you can sub it out for any flavor you want! We opted for Tiramisu gelato in the Affogato and Salted Caramel gelato with our bread pudding. I was a bit disappointed by how small the desserts were, given how pricey they are. However, I have to say THE ESPRESSO IS MIND-BLOWING. I usually don't think fancy espresso shots are worth it, but I would 100% drop the dough for one of these, with or without gelato. Loved the bread pudding, but it's definitely on the lighter side - highly recommend to those of y'all who don't like overly sweet desserts.\n\nCAFE/DOWNSTAIRS: If you don't have a reservation, or want to pop in for a more casual setting, the downstairs area has a decent amount of seating. Behind the counter is a beautiful selection of gelato, pastries/desserts, and sandwiches. You can order coffee, as well as full pasta dishes from the full menu! I absolutely LOVE the gelato selection. Salted Caramel was a seasonal flavor, unfortunately, but it's probably my favorite gelato flavor EVER. It satisfies my sweet tooth but isn't cloyingly sweat or heavy. A close second is the Tiramisu Gelato, which is always available (thank God). To compare to Capogiro, the flavor selection is definitely less varied (you won't get as many interesting fruity/herbal combinations) in keeping with a more traditional Italian theme. I happen to love various combinations of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and nuts, so I think the selection is perfect.\n\nDELIVERY: TBD, definitely keeping this on my order-in list for my next lazy night ;)\n\nTo sum it up, you really can't go wrong with Caffe Gran L'Aquila, no matter what you're looking for.

I called the restaurant prior and they were able to set us up with a reservation in the bar area, even though they typically don't do that for Sips. As it turns out, they do have seats at the bar, however we didn't learn that until we passed some empty seats on our way out. \n\nUpon arrival our table wasn't ready at the time of our reservation. We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. They also weren't able to place us as close to the bar as we had requested, so unfortunately we weren't near our friends who we had wanted to spend time with. Despite closing menus and trying to make contact with every server who walked by, it took about 10 minutes for anyone to check on us. We were about ready to leave, when our server came over and offered his apologies. I'm glad we stayed...\n\nThe experience from there on out was charming. Ordering off the Sips menu to start, I went with the Salice Salentino red wine. It was not on their regular menu, but enjoyable. I found it to be dry, but have a slight sweetness to it as well. According to a quick internet search it's supposed to be a pretty cheap wine, but it was still Italian so whatever. I had the Melanzana Parmigiana off of the Sips menu as well. I'm a sucker for eggplant and this dish consisting of eggplant, ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce did not disappoint. Give me 3 or 4 of them and it could have been a meal. \n\nSince we were comfortable at the table and enjoying ourselves we decided to venture into their dinner menu and went with the Pappardelle al Ragu Aquilano. Now I'm no stranger to this dish, and this execution of the ragu was excellent. Often you can get a bunch of \"mixed meat\" that is undecipherable, but you could really individualize the pork, veal, lamb and chicken while still retaining the general flavor. It was a nice portion to share after each having an appetizer. I would think it would be quite filling when eaten solo. \n\nNow as you may know, I'm not the biggest dessert person, but thoroughly enjoyed my tiramisu flavored gelato. There's something about a unique, house-produced sweet that has me second guessing my whole stance. Splitting the small hit the spot. \n\nWe both left the caf\u00e9 full, but not stuffed. I could only imagine how filling a full three-course meal could be there. \n\nAfter the initial service snafu, we couldn't have asked for more out of our server. Despite a crowded dining room, he was polite, professional and attentive as he could be. \n\nThoroughly charmed by Gran Caffee L'Aquila, I look forward to a return visit.", "date": "2016-06-16 16:59:42", "useful": 7, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 1402, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-04-19 19:23:27"}}

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with much bigger seating inside on the second floor than expected. The overall noise level is well controlled to slightly loud, just not too crazy as the night progressed. My friend thought she couldn't hear the waiter too well at the start of the night - so maybe I'd say it's mixed.\n\nWe were promptly seated with our reservation.\n\nService: Our waiter offered detailed reviews and thoughts of the menu. The actual pacing of the food was quite delayed. For a four course meal, it literally took 2 hours from us sitting down to actually receiving the dessert. At least 10-15 minutes of down time was noted between each course.\n\nFood: \nBread for the table - the olive oil had a slightly tart taste, bread I would have preferred toasted\n\nFirst course: we ordered the cheese plate and the meat plates (Sud Italia and Salumi Verticale) \nFor the salumi (meat plate) - I think two of the meats had a decent taste, but two were misses for me - they're okay samples but don't exactly pair with the cheese plates\nFor the cheese plates - the pecorino has a nice strong taste that stands out on its own, but it's quite overpowering. The capra and caciocavallo were a bit underwhelming and subtle flavored. The fig & strawberry marmolade crostini had a slightly negative tart aftertaste that was a bit unpleasant.\n\nSecond course: Cinghiale - wild boar meatballs - these had a nice solid taste for a meatball. Unfortunately our dish was served lukewarm. \nCarciofi fritti - flash fried artichoke - I think these almost tasted like a potato wedge with that slight artichoke flavor, it was nice to dip with the tomato sauce from the meatballs\n\nThird course: Arrosticini biasini - lamb and bacon skewers - again great flavor for the lamb (my personal favorite protein), but unfortunately was also a bit lukewarm. The spicy mustard gelato on the side was a bit overpowering, and I don't think it necessarily paired with the skewers to my liking. Almost like a wasabi.\n\nGnocchi - beautifully pillowy texture, the mushrooms were tender. There was a delightful truffle scent and I think this was the star of the meal.\n\nFourth course: \nGelato - we asked for the cheesecake alla fragola (strawberry cheesecake with crumble) and cocco e rhum (coconut and rum) - but our waiter brought out a nutella flavor - which unfortunately did not pair well with the strawberry like the coconut. He did bring out the correct gelato when we corrected him. This was a much better choice, but there wasn't much of a rum flavor. The strawberry was nice. The gelato texture overall was melt-in-your-mouth good.\n\nGran panna cotta - A bit heavier than other panna cotta's I've had, there is a nice espresso/chocolate flavor, and it was a nice ending to the meal.\n\nTips/Takeaways:\n-Probably would not return, but worth a try at least once - filling meal for the $40 restaurant week pricing\n-First course: probably would not get the meat or cheese plates\n-Second course: I was satisfied with our meatball and artichoke combo\n-Third course: I think I would rather have tried their other pasta dishes considering how good the gnocchi was\n-Fourth course: The gelato I think was a better choice than the panna cotta\n-Service: Unfortunately, quite slow which negatively impacted the experience of the meal\n-Wait staff - well informed and friendly", "date": "2021-09-20 23:43:11", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 218, "average_stars": 3.83, "yelping_since": "2018-07-14 20:47:36"}}

The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two). Given that this was a substitution from the original order, completely unasked for and unexpected, I am extra appreciative. I'll be making more trips to Gran Caffe l'Aquila (without my colleagues this time) for more happy experiences like these.", "date": "2021-12-15 02:19:20", "useful": 7, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 286, "average_stars": 3.99, "yelping_since": "2008-02-27 22:39:48"}}

If you're looking for an aesthetic dinner place with \"city vibes,\" this would be an excellent place to go.\n\nWORTH FOR PRICE POINT: 5/5\nI have gone to many restaurant weeks, and this was the only restaurant I've experienced with a FOUR-COURSE meal (normally restaurants offer 3 courses). For its four-courses, this was pretty worth it for only $35! The portions were well-sized that I even had left overs to bring home for lunch the next day. I highly recommend checking this restaurant out during restaurant week - you won't regret it!\n\nSERVICE: 5/5\nWonderful! When we asked for balsamic vinegar to go along with the olive oil with our friend, they were very accommodating. When we asked for extra bread, they said they couldn't guarantee because they were almost running out, but they were able to bring out extra bread for us! When I asked the server to take photos of my friend and I, she took quality photos from all different angles - this is probably one of the best experiences I've had with having my photo taken by a \"stranger.\" The server even asked us if the photos were to our liking before going to another table. \n\nFor dessert, I couldn't decide which flavor I wanted so I was able to taste-test. I tasted SO MANY flavors (at least 10 different flavors) and the employees did not even seem a bit annoyed. They were extremely generous with the taste test quantity too! I'm very grateful.\n\nFOOD: 4/5\nThe only reason why I'd give this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the food taste. Don't get me wrong - everything was delicious, but some of the food tasted like what you normally would expect in a well-made dish. I'd give a 5 if there was something in that dish that would set it apart from a dish that I had somewhere else. Here's a run-down of my impression:\n\nBread - 2/5 A bit dry/stale. Not the best bread I've had. But it was nice that they were able to give us two of them.\n\nFIRST COURSE:\nBruschette - 5/5 delicious! Would recommend giving this a try! The blend of fruity with grainy taste was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this.\n\nSalumi Verticale - 3/5 it was my first time having cut Italian meat. The meat itself was great. I did not enjoy the block of cheese as much (I'm lactose in tolerant). The complementary salad they included was average. When you ate the meat, cheese, and salad all together, it did go together very nicely. \n\nSECOND COURSE:\nCinghiale - 4/5 These meatballs are worth a try! Very good meatballs. What I liked the most was the pinge of slight spiciness at the very end - this was a nice surprise!\n\nCarciofi Fritti - 5/5 Artichokes. I LOVED THESE!! Highly, highly recommend. Very flavorable. With the lemon juice squeezed on top, it was very tasty.  This was one of my favorite dishes of the night.\n\nTHIRD COURSE:\nArrostinini Biasini - 4.5/5 Lamb skewers. It was my first time having lamb skewers and I can not stop thinking about them! They were very, very tasty, and the mustard gelato that was served with them was the perfect condiment to bring out the flavor. This was my other favorite dish of the night.\n\nAgnoletti Al Tartufo - 4/5 Gnocci. These were delicious. A little bit on the heavier side, but well-made. I haven't tried many gnocci in my life, but all the ones I've tried tasted like this one.\n\nDESSERT\nGelato - 5/5 Amazing flavor, texture. I got the Mango and the Caffe scoops. While the fruit flavor doesn't mix well with the sweet flavor, both were DELICIOUS. I would come back here for the dessert in a heart beat.\n\nTiramisu - 5/5 This was not on the menu, but the server mentioned they offered it!

While I can't say I'm completely surprised by its downward trajectory, as most new establishments lose focus on keeping their customers happy and more on their bottom line, the overall customer service has become noticeably more apathetic and sometimes downright negligent.\n\nThe menu has remained relatively unchanged over the past few years, and though the food hasn't noticeably depreciated, it is a far cry from the standards and variety that they had a few years ago. Just for comparison's sake, in 2016 and '17, they provided a new menu with offerings from a different region in Italy every few weeks. Whether they ran out of places or just became too lazy to revamp their menu, the offerings have become quite standard--becoming essentially a glorified caf\u00e9.\n\nThe coffee and gelato, too, have become increasingly monetarized. Whereas before there used to be a pretty design in the top of every latt\u00e9 and the blends had stronger fruit accents, both are now gone... When I returned this morning for one last try on a completely empty Sunday morning, the servers displayed little attention and spent more time idling on their phones than actually paying attention to ordering or waiting customers.\n\nAs for the gelato, it is clear that their \"Gelato Champion\" Stefano Biasini is attempting to cash in on his recent gelato successes. As they advertise his name recognition more heavily and incorporate that cost into their prices across-the-board, the value has dropped noticeably. It remains decent gelato, but is it worth it anymore? Not in my book, go for any other dessert in Reading Terminal Market if you want glorified ice cream.\n\nThe service is truly what has dragged Gran Caffe down the most, however. As I hear patrons complaining about how the wait staff has--on repeated occasions--lost credit cards and regularly taken half an hour to take orders and then bring food during even off-peak hours, it is clear that management cares more about profits than retaining customers.\n\nIs Gran Caffe still worth a try for first-timers?

First off, the only reservation we could make was for outdoor seating and figured that the restaurant would be accommodating for this.\n\nWe were seated outside and we could tell that this wasn't going to be idea.  It was already cold (low to mid 40's) by the time our 9:30pm reservation was.  Outside, they had heating ducts above us with a single vent to each table/cubicle.  The issue is, you'd feed a burst of hot air every 10 minutes or so and then nothing, so there wasn't a constant source of heat to keep you warm.  In addition, there were no flaps or anything there to help keep the heat in.  We all know heat rises, so blowing hot air down, while outside on a breezy cold fall evening with no way of keeping the warm air inside, isn't going to work.\n\nOn to the food.  It was \"OK\".  I wouldn't write home about it and I wouldn't come back for it, so I was shocked that the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  We definitely didn't have that experience.  \n\nWe asked our server about the cheese tasting platters.  We were a party of 3 and she said there'd be no problem and have \"plenty\" of cheese for our party.  Well,  hate to differ but what we got wasn't enough for 3.  2, yes, but 3, no.  There wasn't even 3 pieces of the crustini cracker for 3 people.  There was a VERY small amount of a fig spread on an endive and another VERY small dab of balsamic vinegar on another piece of endive.  \n\nTwo of us had the gnocchi which were good.  The paccheri was decent, but I felt the portion was small.\n\nDessert was very awkward.  We ordered the gelato (again, what people rave about)... We had the chocolate strawberry which was good, and the cannoli flavored gelato (didn't taste like it to me).  Two of us finished while the third was finishing her gelato.

Gran has a few levels (the front of the street level is their coffee shop and gelato counter). There's a good chance if you're just coming here for gelato or espresso that you may get something of quality but that certainly doesn't carry over to their food. The fact that their prices are as high as they are just put the nail on the coffin for my wife and I who both agreed our meal here was one of the worst we've ever had, anywhere. Top 3 bad in fact (probably top 1 for her). It's also worth mentioning that the place also just feels like a large chain restaurant right down to the uniforms, borderline costumes, that the wait staff is forced to wear. \n\nFor drinks she ordered a $12 cocktail called Sgroppino (lemon sorbet, processco, lemoncino vodka, fresh mint). This ended up being an incredibly weak and disgustingly sweet drink that she couldn't finish. Most of the beers were $7-10 but some as low as $5 or as high as $14 for a 12oz Italian beer with a 5% abv. I went with a $5 Peroni. For a starter we ordered their arancini ($10). This came presented beautifully and the texture was right but we both agreed it tasted a bit like soap and there was something definitely off with them. \n\nFor a meal I had the Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano ($16.50) which is a wide ribbon pasta with slow cooked pork, veal, lamb, and chicken in a tomato based sauce. The meat had been pulverized to the point where it wasn't recognizable and the sauce was the worst tomato sauce I've ever had. It was the same tomato sauce that the aranacini came on and tasted like it came right out of a can of Ragu from the super market. I've had a lot of red sauce over the years and I don't hesitate to say that this was the worst and most store bought tasting I've ever had at a restaurant before. It was so disappointing that I have no doubt that I could have had a better plate of pasta from Olive Garden. \n\nAs disappointing as my meal was, it was still edible which is more than I can say about my wife's dish. I felt so bad for her that I traded plates with her and couldn't even muster a second bite of her food after tasting it. To this day we both feel like gagging thinking about her dish and joke about how bad it was. She ordered the Agnoletti Al Tartufo ($19) which was ravioli stuffed with veal, pork, onion & herbs, topped with a butter-sage sauce and a little block of the chef's truffle gelato creation. The waitress assured us that the gelato wouldn't actually cool down the dish at all and would just melt over the dish infusing an extra flavor to it. Well this pretentious little gimmick did in fact cool down the entire dish to barely over room temperature and what it added to the dish was a disgusting overpowering truffle flavor that even a truffle lover like my wife couldn't stand. The ravioli's filling wasn't meaty either which was a big draw to the veal and pork stuffing. The mushy filling paired with this incredibly overpowered truffle flavoring, lowered temperature, butter sauce, and mediocre noodles just made this meal completely inedible. \n\nI've never been so disappointed not only in a restaurant but in Yelp's overwhelming praise for such a horrible Italian restaurant. Shame on you all for not knowing what good Italian food should taste like.\n\nUPDATE:\nI received one of the least professional business responses to this review where the manager Darren writes in part: \"I believe the problem is that you have been subjected to so much Olive Garden style food over the years, that YOU in fact don't know what true, authentic Italian flavor is supposed to be.\"\n\nInstead of engaging this guy privately I figured I'd just respond here. First of all I've only eaten at Olive Garden once in my life. \n\nSecondly, as far as my track record goes, with over 2,150 reviews on Yelp, only about 1% of those reviews are for 1 star so you can see I very rarely slam a place for being bad. Of those 23 one star reviews, only 8 of them are to food related businesses and half of those places have since gone out of business. About 40% of the restaurant's I've written 2 star reviews for have also gone under which is a stark difference from only about 12% of the restaurants I've written 5 star reviews for. With nearly 1,000 restaurant reviews and living not only in a mostly Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn but the area of the country with the most Italian-Americans and Italian restaurants I've eaten at more than my fair share of high quality Italian restaurants. \n\nThirdly and most importantly when I visited, it was only 2 months after coming back from my two week honeymoon in Italy where my wife and I traveled all around the country searching out the best food possible. My taste in Italian food is clearly not the problem here.", "date": "2016-08-18 17:34:01", "useful": 17, "funny": 9, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 2227, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2006-10-24 22:40:11"}}

You know, that argument you have with your best friend every few years that makes you wonder why you're friends in the first place.  Then a week or so goes by and you realize it's only natural, and it's OK not to see eye to eye on everything!  I forgive you Yelp and I'm not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.  And by greet I mean, come over and ask if we were ready to order when we didn't even have menus yet.  He didn't introduce himself, mention any specials or crack a smile. (under a mask that was half off his face)\n\nWe ordered a prosciutto plate which was fairly dry with some wilted greens.  I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don't remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there's more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, \"come on people\". The effing nerve! \n\nNow remember, I tipped 15% because it's the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won't go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.  I have no sympathy for people who dial it in at work, put no effort and expect optimal results.  All this coupled with mediocre food qualifies for a 2 star rating.

My husband and I were taking a leisurely Sunday stroll when the heat made us both crave some cool respite. I remembered that Square One Coffee had just opened near where we were, so I led him into their sizable space on 13th Street.\n\nThe place feels HUGE when you walk in. Lots of light colored wood, and the bright sunlight filled the one room. The counter is towards the back, and the front has a bunch of small tables and chairs - no table could hold more than 3 people, and it would be slightly cramped, not sure why they didn't want to add a few larger tables to fill the space and make it seem less...empty and lonely. The two quiet staffers were nice and answered our few questions, pointing out their few baked goods (not made on premises, but a local bakery nonetheless). We both went with their cold brew, which was delicious and smooth (should've asked for less ice though). Prices are on par with the other counter culture coffee establishments in Philly, so slightly pricey. But you can also buy bags of their different roasts to make your own at home!

And various toppings and spreads. Of the 3 bagel options, I picked a sesame bagel and asked for cream cheese initially. Later, I went back and asked for a a different spread and they said no because they all had various prices. Well- there are no prices listed for anything on the food menu, so I had no idea.

We had a large group on a week night, and the place was nearly empty. A few small groups around - but for the most part, a quiet night. \n\nWe had 9 people, and one guest brought a friend, so 10 total. We were seated at a table made for 6. The hostess was visibly annoyed with us and frustrated. We asked the hostess if it were possible to have a larger table. There were several larger tables available - and tables that could easily be pushed together. The hostess refused and said we could squeeze in to the 6 person table. The hostess said, we should have told her 10 people not 9 were coming. We said - this is a table for 6. Does one extra person really make such a huge difference? The entire place was empty, they couldn't accommodate one extra person? The hostess walked away in a huff. \n\nFrom there, the experience continued to devolve. We were served 6 water glasses - no more. The food took very long to come out. The vegetables and dip were sad and small portioned, shockingly small for the price. The pizza was greasy and nearly inedible. The pretzels were burned and stale. \n\nThe service was patchy at best, rude at worst. The waitress spilled half of our popcorn on the head of one of our guests, getting it all over her hair, shoulders, and floor. She half heartedly apologized, but did not replace the popcorn or offer additional popcorn. We asked for additional pens for a game (the pens in the game were out of ink) and were treated like we had asked to kill someone's first born son. At our already small and smushed table - no plates were taken away as we finished our food. We constantly had to hail down the waitress, even though the place was nearly empty. \n\nLike other reviewers have noted, the prices on the bill are HIGHER than the prices indicated on the menu, and we also experienced MORE items added.

We decided on friday night to try the place out. I called and asked if they had any room for a party of 10. The lady on the phone told me there's another party coming in with the same amount and that there was one big table left and whoever got there first would get it. We came and saw the big table was still open. I told the hostess in the front that I had just called and had a party of 9. We had 8 people there and 1 person parking. Instead of seating us at the big table , she sat us at a round table that normally seats 4-6 people. We were uncomfortable squeezing 8 people to start with. She then told our server  that we would be a party of 9 even though she only gave us 8 chairs. When our 9th person walked in , the hostess then told us there was no more normal chairs and to go grab a foldable chair. Odd but we brushed it off. What made no sense was the fact that they did not seat anybody on the big table for the first 45 minutes we were there and when they did decide to seat a party , it was a party of 6. Wouldn't it have made more sense to give us a big table and give the party of 6 the round table ? We then had two other friends who popped in to grab a beer but played no games with us. They left within 5 minutes but were still charged the $5 fee per person which was fine. The drinks and food were good. A little pricy but understandable. What made my experience bad was the hostess. My other friends were around the area grabbing dinner and they wanted to stop by. They came in with a group of 4 and came in to say hi to us and went back to the front to talk to the hostess to grab a table. The hostess laughed at their faces and said \"Y'all thought you guys were just going to walk past me and say hi to your friends?\". The hostess then proceeded to complain that our party was getting too big. My friends were not trying to sit at our table since they already saw how cram we were on our small table.

The service was good the first time I went (party of 4).  The second time we had a party of 11 and the service was spotty.  They had strange rules around where we could place chairs to accommodate our group, and scolded us for not making a reservation (we tried to, but they said they don't do reservations for groups of less than 12, so...). The lowlight was that the server *voluntarily* did separate checks for each person, then TOTALLY messed it up. I had to spend 30 min explaining it to the server rather than enjoying game time, and then she was a bit rude despite it being her fault, and I was ultimately still overcharged - not the way I would've liked to end the evening. \n\nOverall: Great concept, and I'll likely go back if people are going.

I am really into board games and party games, as is my family, so I was \"down like a frown\" when my sister invited me to check this place out.\n\nWhen my sister arrived, we ordered food and then an employee escorted us to the game library to help choose something that was good for 2 players. I really liked that they have someone with knowledge of the games to help. Our person, David, was really friendly and also patient with us while we nit-picked about game selection. He was again helpful when we had questions while we played (which was often). I think it is half the battle to have someone breakdown a game for you, as it allows you to just play. We liked the game we chose, and I think we'll go back and play it again. I liked trying something that we had never heard of, and the leisure game play as we chatted was probably the best part of the day.\n\nI only didn't give a whole 5 stars because I wasn't wowed by other elements of the experience. Not to get all Yelp-y about it, but the restroom I used was really small and the toilet and sink were awkwardly near each other. I also was a bit surprised by the lack of ice in our water. They were happy to replenish our water, which is nice, but it's not what I prefer. (My sister tells me restaurants do this to be healthier, which I didn't know about.) There were also no napkins or utensils placed at the tables. My guess is that there are probably some people who don't eat, and it would be cumbersome to gameplay. In that way, it makes sense. Still, maybe having silverware to grab nearby or a napkin dispenser would be helpful. I had mac and cheese, and stringy cheese got on my hands and face and I didn't really know what to do. \n\nMy food was great! My only minor complaint would be that it wasn't hot at first. The game took a little while to explain, which extended the time before I started eating, but I could tell it wasn't hot when it first arrived. The staff were apologetic and brought out another plate of it when I let them know about this. The second time around, I could see the steam rising from the food! It was rather good, but a small portion for $11. \n\nOn that note: once you throw in the sitting fee ($7), you could spend a pretty penny here on food and drinks and gaming. Taking into account the minor qualms above, I considered giving maybe 3 stars. However, the strength of Thirsty Dice is really in its multitude of games and the convenience you get of being helped with rules and set-up. I suspect the drinks are also high-quality as well!

I can not stress this enough. We played a few classics, a few new ones, but I was most excited to play the new updated Fireball Island. (FYI, that game was fun but man it took forever just to set up and read the rules).\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, all smiles and a willingness to chat you up.

So much so that I still bought a T-shirt on the way out. \n\nAs far as I know, this is the only place in the Philly area that has this board game cafe concept AND does it as well as it does.

I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly, she said it might be a 45 minute wait so we checked out the games and got drinks at the bar. The boozy milkshake was nice and the cocktails were actually really good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table, and played 3 games in the 2.5 hour chunk of time, and we definitely felt like the $5/person was worth it. We also got a few bites including the pizza and popcorn which were both fine - I wouldn't say you should go there for the food, but if you just need a snack it hits the spot. \n\nA few things would have brought it up to 5 stars. The service was a little slow, we kept having to flag the waitress down to order more drinks and food since she never checked in, and at one point I had to go on a hunt for napkins myself since none were brought with the pizza. It was a busy night, so I can let some of that go.  \n\nI also wish the staff that were there to recommend games were more helpful. While we were waiting for a table and browsing the games one of the guys approached us and asked what we were looking for, and we gave him some criteria (something pretty easy to learn, maybe more of a collaborative game with a story, etc). We talked to him for what felt like forever and he never actually recommended a game, he just kept saying things that were basically like \"All our games are fun, it just depends what you like! It's up to you!\" Of course it's up to us, but a little direction would have been nice. Even when one of our party mentioned an example of a game she'd played before and asked if there was anything similar we never got a straight answer, so we kind of gave up and she picked something she had played before to start us off. \n\nIf you're like me and haven't played many board games, I would do some research beforehand so you know what to grab when you get there. They have a sample list on the website but not much information about what the games are like besides very general categories (Classic, Strategy, Party), and when you're there the descriptions on the box don't tell you much about what to expect and it's a little overwhelming.

Upon walking in, the place had a very welcoming vibe- warm yet spacey, a wall chopped full of games, and at that moment a couple of large parties enjoying brunch and playing board games. We were greeted by Dylan, the host who explained how the place ran. \n\nMe and my partner were sat at the two top tucked in a corner next to another couple. We decided to browse the menu before checking out the games. However, at least 15-20 minutes had passed, food and drinks and even games were picked, and still no sight from our server. The gametender introduced himself to us, to which we let him know we were ready to order. He said he would get our server. \n\nThis was the reoccurring theme of our visit  - having to ask for everything and everyone for help because our server was nowhere to be found. Could I see him servicing other tables or waiting for food or drinks instead of greeting us? Absolutely. As someone who's worked as a food server previously, I must say this server was the absolute worse. I had to ask the host to ask him to bring us water (this being around 30 mins after we were sat) and I watched him bring tables sat AFTER us their drinks and foods BEFORE us. It seemed as if he knew he messed up, and would avoid us/our table. When he would bring us our things he never offered an apology, water refills, no \"how is everything?\", no \"is there anything else I can get you?\" - literally nothing. New flash buddy: service like that gets you no tip. Upon finally getting our food at least 45-hour later, my churro waffle was warm and yummy, yet my partner's chicken and waffles was cold and bland. Yet again, had to call over another person to get it remade. \n\nI really believe the place has potential! To be around a year and a half already it's clearly doing something right. Food and drinks on the pricey end but filling nonetheless. The food and the atmosphere was good, I really believe we just had an incredibly bad and maybe even new server that couldn't handle two 4-tops and one 2-top simultaneously...

They didn't take reservations for groups under 12, which is understandable since it seems like a small place. When we arrived, one person from our party was going to be 30 mins late. They said they couldnt seat us until we were all there. We asked if we could just have a table and add a chair later, they said no. We asked if we could sit at the communal table for now and just move to a table when we were all there. The WOC behind the counter spun her head around and rudely said \"No! I'll tell you right now, that's not happening.\" Apparently if we want to switch tables, we need to close out our checks and then open a new tab. Okay, whatever.

Everything else was a very mediocre if not downright bad experience. \n\nFirst the reservation process - you NEED a reservation for starters - then they're very strict (at least they're upfront about it). Can't be seated if the whole party isn't there and they give your reservation up if you're not there in 15min. They actually threatened this upon my group when I was late. Since it was late in the evening they let them sit down without me there. This isn't some five star restaurant so I don't see why this is all necessary. \n\nOur board game expert person introduced himself at the beginning and explained how it works and that he can help us choose stuff and play the games if needed. All well and good except he never came back around to check on us or see if we needed help or anything. The game selection is VAST which is great if you're into board games. That really is the highlight of this place. The 5$ Fee PER PERSON to \"access the library\" seems silly although I suppose this is to ensure they make some money with people who buy one drink and sit there for 2.5 hours. Still, I think it would be more fair to just have a flat fee for the table. \n\nNow food and service wise...terrible. Our server never filled our water glasses without us having to make a concerted effort and flagging him down ( I suppose they wanted to be sure to live up to the name \"Thirsty Dice.\" They forgot what I ordered (I got the Dark Side cocktail which was in and of itself not great). My friend got a scoop of ice cream and a shot of espresso. It was minuscule and still cost 9$. Two of my other friends asked for hot drinks with a shot of alcohol in them. The server got one person drink wrong (Brought coffee instead of hot chocolate) and then on top of that it was cold. Tried to send it back but the server was always missing in action so we just gave up. Furthermore, both of them felt that was really no alcohol in them at all which made it all not worth the 9$ each. We also ordered a cup of candy, which presumably isn't hard to make but literally took 30min to come out. He also never came by to clear used cups and dishes, and having extra table space when playing a board game seems reasonable...To top it all off, tip was included  so our server made away with a decent tip even though he more or less ignored us and did everything wrong the whole night. \n\nThe one nice thing was that they didn't kick us out after the 2.5 hr listed time limit. It was nearing closing time and the place was clearing out so it just made sense to let us sit there till midnight. \n\nGreat concept, love the collection of board games, but the price seems a bit much, the drinks are hit or miss (mostly miss) and the service (both our server and the Game Master Person) was terrible.

Sure enough, we ended up there on a Saturday night - St. Paddy's Day weekend, no less - to a virtually packed house playing an array of games. For $5 a person per every 2 & 1/2 hours of play, you can take your pick from 800+ games of various format and difficulty levels. $5 may seem like a lot, but for the upkeep of hundreds of games, I understand why. The two of us started out with Candyland; in battle for the best two out of three - with our second round causing us to reshuffle the cards THRICE as we kept getting stuck in The Molasses Swamp or a cherry pitfall - we ended up playing an intense battle that I don't recall being so dramatic form my youth. Ha! And after we had a few hard ciders and plates of their delicious mac & cheese, we switched it up for a few rounds of Quattro, a cerebral and involved game of wits.\n\nAs this spot closes at midnight on Saturdays and we got there around 9:30, our 2 & 1/2 came to close fairly abruptly; we were about to go old school again with a game of Mouse Trap when we noticed it was past 11:30. Next time! We both really had a lot of fun, and it's nice to have this option, especially in a part of Philly I've really never explored in past visits.\n\nA final note: The staff, especially the hostess, were all accommodating to my handicapped S.O., which was greatly appreciated, as always.

In my case, the hiccup was that the dessert menu listed on the website won't actually be available until they start serving dinner in the coming weeks. I also didn't make it easy on anyone by putting in a pretty complex order (rugelach to go, tea, brown sugar ricotta toast and the salmon grain bowl--which wouldn't be available until after 11 AM and it was only 10:30ish--to eat in) and then making it even more complicated by asking for them to hold the toast so that I could have it after the grain bowl. Yet, they managed to handle all of that quirkiness with grace. My friend's food arrived--he got the grilled cheese on a Jerusalem bagel and seemed quite pleased with it--and Chef Solomonov, who was actually acting as runner (a smart move as the kitchen staff works out the kinks), asked if I wanted to have the toast now, and I decided to go for it, since I was pretty hungry and it was still a little while before 11.\n\nShortly thereafter, a thickish slice of toast arrived, cut diagonally down the middle, topped with ricotta and figs, with brown sugar and a strategically administered blueberry syrup. A home run. I (somewhat reluctantly) allowed my friend to have a small piece, and he fell in love with it, vowing to return just so he could have his own order.\n\nThe nice thing about the toast is that while it was sweet, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and the portion size was just right, so when my grain bowl arrived, I was ready to go. The two of them make a great combination, in whatever order you choose to eat them. The dish was called \"mujadara,\" and it included slow-roasted salmon, labneh (dusted with sumac), cucumbers and rice with lentils. It's a beautifully composed dish, and the portion is sufficient without being overwhelming. It could be lunch on its own for light eaters, or with the toast is quite satisfying for those of us who eat a little more but still don't want to be stuffed to the brim.\n\nThe physical space is lovely--there is a communal table and counter seating in addition to a number of tables toward the back--and it's light and airy and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and generally quite efficient, though they're still sorting a few little things like when to clear plates and handling the traffic flow--all to be expected when you've just opened.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have friendly people serving delicious food in a lovely setting.

I got the feta borek--or boreka with the Hebrew name--They seem to promote themselves as Israeli cuisine--The borek was delicate, and covered in sesame seeds which really elevated it. That addition made it better than any I've had in turkey or Eastern Europe. But the other three kinds of borek were not covered in sesame seed so I don't know if they would stand out as much. I would've preferred the rugalach to be fruit options too and not only chocolate--But for those who like chocolate it was very chocolatey. Though you can't just get one-they give you three. My husband gave the pistachio sticky bun 8/10. It was on the drier side, like Jewish baked goods usually are. Their bagel sandwiches smelled amazing and appeared quickly grilled and flattened (panini style) and covered in sesame seeds.

While the AIP was not all that different from how I normally eat at home (mostly non-starchy vegetables, animal protein, healthy fats and very low glycemic fruit (once every few weeks), it was stricter. No nightshades, no chiles, no eggs, no coffee or seeds (sesame, cumin, rye, mustard et cetera), zero dairy, no sugar (honey and maple syrup are okay), no alcohol, no grains. The first week was tough and I felt lousy, but 5 weeks in-woo hoo!-do I feel one million percent better physically and mentally than I did 6 weeks ago. \n\nAs a treat for my Spartan existence and as an excuse to get a massage, a mani/pedi and some time in Rittenhouse Square's park, I ordered some of K'Far's Breakfast Bundles on line to be shared with a few friends for a socially distanced picnic. \n\nOrdering is very simple and if you don't have Venmo (I don't), you don't need it nor do you need to download anything onto your phone. You pick your items from their site, ordering starts every Wednesday, you specify the day and time you will pick up, your order is confirmed via e-mail and you are told to arrive at the specified time, call the K'Far number, give your name and your order will be brought out to you. Easy, right?\n\nI finished with my sybaritic activities a bit early, so I took a slow walk to S. 19th St. and called in to pick up. The patio is open for dining but it's tiny; however, you can order at their window, take away or eat there, assuming you can get a table. Of course, depending on your arrival time and what's been pre-ordered, some things may be already sold out. Everything was socially distanced/anti-COVID compliant with 6 feet markers for the order line, masked/gloved servers and runners and recyclable to go containers with no napkins or utensils. That caused me to have to text the folks I was meeting, asking them to supply that portion of the picnic, but I had no issue at all that K'Far didn't provide these things in my order. \n\nFor our picnic, I ordered the Boreka Bundle (3 borekas-potato, feta and swiss chard with cheese), the Jerusalem Bagel Bundle with 2 spreads (4 bagels and in our case, za'atar butter and vegetable cream cheese), a Mushroom Kubaneh Toast and 2 slices of walnut cake. My fellow diners were bringing iced coffee, fresh juice, cold seltzer and iced masala chai, though I could have purchased tea and coffee drinks from K'Far had I wished. \n\nI waited on the sidewalk for about 10 minutes for the order and enjoyed being outside in the sun and people watching. 98% of the people passing by and waiting to order were masked. Diners, of course, were not but if one had to go inside to use the toilet, a mask was required. A pleasant runner called my name, handed me my full bag of fresh, warm, fragrant food and I was off to The Square. \n\nThe borekas were just okay. We could see but not taste the potato in one. It was very flakey and covered in everything bagel topping. The feta boreka was light on the very mild feta. The winner, if there had to be one, was the cheese (kashkaval) and swiss chard. Stina, to our tastes, does a better boreka. \n\nThe bagel bundle was quite a hit. These are not your typical New York bagels. Jeruslem bagels are in a class by themselves. They are oval, covered in sesame seeds, and have airy innards. Not at all dense and heavy. The 2 spreads were marvelous and we couldn't decide which was a better choice. The cream cheese was light, not whipped, but not the dense Philadelphia stuff one generally gets with bagels. I won't say if anyone in the group used their fingers to get all of the left over spread that didn't make it to the bagels. \n\nThe Mushroom Kubaneh Toast is a rich, HEAVY dish. The bread is thick, tasty and holds up well to the thick layer of urfa pepper mascarpone and the heap of oyster, shiitake and mitake mushrooms crowning it. We all split this one order and doing so did not make any one of us feel at all deprived. If you order this and plan to eat it alone, consider it a meal in itself. One order for one person would be extremely filling. \n\nWe all ate to satiation then stretched, yawned, rested, chatted, drank our cold drinks and basked in the dappled, green light of the park before finally tucking into the walnut cake. 2 of the party expressed disappointment that I did not order the Pastry Box, to which I replied OINK OINK, but when we divied the walnut cake, it was unanimously agreed that these dense cake slices were an excellent and fitting 'after' for all we'd previously consumed. I love walnuts; in this cake, just barely sweet and very well textured, the walnuts shine. It was superb with our iced coffee. \n\nDon't get any combo of these bundles/dishes expecting a bargain breakfast. (The toast alone was $12-but rightly so...)

So giving up I just walked over to the bar and got the drinks myself. That is a BIG NO in service. Then realizing that we don't know what is in the flight, the bartender finally walks over to us and explains (all in 3 seconds) the 3 vermouths. What frustrated us the most was that not one of them apologized for the delay!

But, I'll make an exception for Camille Cogswell. The talented Ms. Cogswell, whose superlative desserts have given us yet another reason to visit Zahav.\n\nThere's good reason to my discipline. The first few weeks of a bakery or restaurant are hardly ever reflective of what's it capable of. No such worries at K'Far. No apparent operational kinks. The service and execution is top notch! Mike Solomonov is personally present and bridging the kitchen with the client. You can see Camille walking around with the bemused smile of someone who's still not reconciled with her celebrity. The GM is cheerfully handing out menus to those waiting in line, warmly greeting those entering, and delivering the inventory reports of the latest item the cafe has run out of. I've ribbed her as \"the bearer of bad news\", and she mostly took it well... mostly.\n\nSpeaking of the items they run out of: in my experience, on weekdays, they're out of the pistachio bun by ~ 9 am, and the mini-babka by 9:15-9:30 am (cafe is open 8 am -2 pm currently, dinner service to follow later). These are the two most popular items, in order (though I prefer the texturally complex chocolate Babka with its accent of orange over the pistachio sticky bun - and expect my view to become the popular consensus in coming weeks). The next to run out will be two of the four Borekas (the flakier Feta usually goes first, and is my favorite). The Rugelach (my favorite of all their desserts!) are the next most popular item, but they'll be gone by 10 am. A couple behind me in line tried to guilt me that they'd come all the way from Nashville, hoping to warm my heart before I took the last available ones... (I left them 2). You can safely count on the availability of the Jerusalem bagels. I'd rank the egg and cheese highest, followed by the grilled cheese and then the Basturma.\n\nIf you're picking the optimal time to visit, I'd recommend 8:45 - 9:00 am on weekdays: popular items haven't yet run out, and the wait is minimal as the 8 am crowd (that's been waiting in line since 7:30 am) has already been served. Expect to wait in line 40 minutes on the weekend, initially.\n\nIf there's a weak link - and I'm stretching here to illuminate an area for improvement - it would be the coffee drinks section.

A lot of the reviews stated that they waited over an hour to get in but when we arrived on a Wednesday around 2PM the place was nearly empty.  We decided to eat outside.  The inside of the place was really aesthetically pleasing with a cool modern decor.  The outside was just a few tables outside and nothing special but we really came just for the food.\n\nWe weren't sure if they offered waiter service or what the deal was so I walked inside and asked the counter person.  She explained that they don't have physical menus and that you just seat yourself and scan the QR symbol, fulfill your order online and a waiter will bring out your food.\n\nWe put in our order but it was a bit of a struggle because the online menu service they use was quite buggy (freezing up, wiping out the cart, etc.).  However, after several attempts we were able to get our order in.  We noticed the taxes on the order were 18% and thought it was just another problem with the app so I went inside to ask about it.  The manager came over and explained that the Philadelphia tax was 8% and the ordering service charges another 10% which goes to them and is out of their control.  In addition they add another 10% service charge.  At the end of the day you are paying 28% between tax and service on top of the bill. \n\nThe food was fantastic and unique.  We were a party of 4 and ordered 2 Jerusalem bagel grilled cheeses and 1 Jerusalem bagel with smoked salmon and capers.  A Jerusalem bagel is not your traditional boiled and baked rounder.  It's a thin oval shaped baked bread covered in sesame seeds.  It's actually delicious and definitely different than anything I've ever eaten.  We also ordered an Arabic salad which was dressed perfectly and had a crumbled, soft feta that tasted like a cross between goat and feta among other delicious ingredients.  We also ordered a Kale salad that was finely chopped and had squash, pine nuts, shaved fennel and more....equally delicious.  \n\nFor drinks we tried the fresh brewed unsweetened citron ice tea and berry iced tea which were great.  We also had a coffee that was notable as well.  All in all, this was delicious and filling.\n\nOne thing to note is that if you sit outside like we did you may experience \"street people\" wandering into the outdoor area asking for money as we saw.  We also had a guy wander in and start yelling and cursing which made the experience a bit uncomfortable for everyone in our party.  I would definitely not sit out there again especially since it's so nice inside.\n\nThe bill after surcharges was over $76 so it was a bit pricey for what it was (3 drinks, 3 bagels, 2 salads).  However, the food was so good I will certainly return again.", "date": "2021-10-21 21:00:45", "useful": 9, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "user": {"review_count": 337, "average_stars": 3.49, "yelping_since": "2012-02-04 02:07:06"}}

Immediately, the space is beautifully decorated and every inch instagram-worthy, from the marble tabletops to the millennial pink galore. There was a small line to order at the register, but it moved quickly and gave us some time to peruse the menu. You have the option of either dining in or taking the food to go, and despite the caf\u00e9 being somewhat crowded, there was enough just enough seating to go around. After placing our order, we received our pastries on a plate, grabbed a number, and found a table to sit at. Although this is not a full-service restaurant, I noticed staff bringing water and utensils over to other tables and patiently waited for the same. I debated whether or not we were allowed to go grab utensils from the service station ourselves, but after half our food came out and we didn't want to wait until it got cold, my friend and I just went up and helped ourselves.\n\nOnto the food itself, we started off with the Grilled Cheese bagel. It was delicious and tasted like a whole grilled-cheese-tomato-soup in one with the balance of flavorful tomatoes, cheese, and za'atar seasoning. The sandwich came warm, but I wish it were hot and melty since it should be served fresh from the kitchen. We also shared a Tunisian Salad which was very underwhelming. The salad arrived messily presented with four sad little slices of tuna. It tasted fine, but was far from special. We asked for olives on the side since I don't like olives, but my friend found that the olives were quite flavorless anyway. I would probably stick with the pastries here rather than the prepared food. \n\nNext up, my friend and I split a few baked goods. The Potato Boreka was fantastic, with a savory curried filling. I really looked forward to the Pistachio Sticky Bun which was delicious as well, if a tad oversweet. I was missing a bit of the pistachio flavor, but the texture of the bun was spot on. Finally, we split a Mini Chocolate Babka bursting with chocolate flavor and probably a good alternative to the little Rugelach which are much tinier and more expensive than a nice fat Babka. To cut the sweetness a bit, I ordered the Yemenite Latte as well. Disappointingly, my latte came in a paper cup despite dining in and was not filled all the way. The drink itself was nicely spiced though and just slightly sweet, very nicely balanced. Again, not hot but almost lukewarm and as a note: you cannot substitute the latte with non-dairy milk, whole milk only.\n\nOverall, the food and experience here were pretty good, but did not quite live up to the hype. I might return to try some of the other menu items like the toast or other pastries, but the bagels and salads especially are quite overpriced for what you get.", "date": "2019-10-13 18:06:38", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 91, "average_stars": 4.43, "yelping_since": "2016-03-27 22:46:37"}}

My friends and I opted for late night dining, as reservations for groups of 3 or more are hard to come by nowadays due to their popularity. Our server informed us that they ran out of the Harissa chicken and the sour cherry lamb, and my one friend was very disappointed, as he really enjoyed the dish the last time he dined with K'far. However, it did not really dampen our dining experience, as we ordered a number of wonderful dishes to share. \n\nTo start, we ordered the baked feta, the foie gras toast, and instead of dessert, I asked for the konafi as an appetizer. \n\nBaked Feta - The baked feta appetizer is a block of warm feta, served with a harissa sauce. The harissa is spicy and flavorful, but I personally thought that the feta was way too salty. \n\nFoie Gras Toast - Thick cut Kubaneh toast drizzled with sweet molasses and topped with scoops of cold foie gras. I'm a general fan of all things sweet, savory, fatty and buttery. This was a decent appetizer, although I think the foie gras would've been an even more wonderful pairing with the toast if it was served warm, rather than cold. \n\nKanafeh - This traditional melted cheese dish is typically served as a dessert. I asked for the Konafi as an appetizer, so that my dining companions would get a chance to try this before they got too full for dessert. Melted cheese covered in a crispy noodle-like pastry, topped with a beautiful syrup - can't get any better than that. \n\nAs for the main courses, we ordered the salmon, the T'bit, the freekah \"risotto\", and the ribeye cap to share. \n\nSalmon - The salmon skin was delicate and crisp, and the fish was cooked perfectly. The salmon laid on a bed of mujadara rice. If I was dining alone or with one other person, I would say that this portion is a bit small. I had no complaints since there was a group of us and we were sampling everything. \n\nT'bit - This is a comfort meal for sure. It was a rice casserole filled with braised beef and vegetables, encased in grape leaves and served with a bed of dressed romaine. However, I think the dish could've used more flavor, because I found mostly rice and not enough other filling in the dish. \n\nFreekah \"risotto\" - If you are are a fan of mushrooms. I highly recommend this. I love the texture of rice and nuts, and I loved the roasted pumpkin topping. \n\nRibeye Cap - I saved the best for last. This was my favorite dish of the evening. We received four portions - enough for each of us to have a sampling of the flavorful, tender beef. I highly recommend this. The caramelized fennel was a wonderful accompaniment to the beef. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered a malabi custard, as this is my favorite dessert at Zahav. While the presentation is more casual, it did not take away from my rose-flavored custard, topped with a sweet jam and almond brittle. \n\nThe kitchen generously gave us a wonderfully tart guava sorbet topped with fresh pomegranate and coconut shavings, as well as a warm chocolate babka with ice cream. We really appreciated the service and the complimentary desserts. Overall, I was torn between 4/5 stars. I would say this is more of a 4.5 star experience. I knocked off a star, because some of the dishes missed the mark a little on seasoning, and I realized that most of our dishes contained some form of rice. I'm Asian, I love rice, but at some point, we felt like it was a bit much. I will definitely have to come back for their breakfast pastries!

The addition of the fried egg was nice to add a little protein boost to the already hardy sandwich -- we even skipped lunch we were still so full.

The place itself is only a block away from us (awesome!), and the space is really cute and homey looking - I love the exterior also, it reminds me of France. The staff seems very nice, although I did not utilize their knowledge for selecting my loaves. They offered to slice up the challah loaf for me, but I declined - I assume they do that for people who are going to use it for french toast.\n\nNow the bread...that multigrain is enough to get me to start snacking on bread 24/7, its so flavorful and filled with crunchy grains with a soft interior and nicely crisp crust. Peanut butter and nutella, brie or goat cheese, it went well with anything I decided to top it with. The challah also was great - soft, slightly sweet and eggy, I'm excited to use it for french toast and bread pudding soon (although its not the best challah I've had - sadly that's reserved for another place that I can't easily get to anymore).

Nothing, of course, looked bad. But, nothing looks exceptional, and the prices are not really worth what they offer.

Sure, you can get a good donut from the Amish at Reading Terminal Market, or a good canele from Market Day Canele. But, Philadelphia is not teeming with exceptional bread bakers, cake makers, or other baking specialists like some U.S. cities have like New York, San Francisco, or Chicago. \n\nIf Metropolitan Bakery is one of the best things that Rittenhouse Square has for the time being, it will obviously be much more time to come before the economy of Center City and Rittenhouse Sq, in particular, expand to the point that its residents will be able to find an amazing loaf of bread, the perfect croissant, or a host of other baked things that make life worth living.", "date": "2014-02-25 05:26:14", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 207, "average_stars": 3.38, "yelping_since": "2013-04-06 17:32:49"}}

Fine if you don't like the decor, but don't knock down stars and go on about it unless it isn't clean or something. Heaven forbid everyone not be like you and your marvelous selves! I walked in my first time expecting a hideously uncomfortable space. Well, I ended up asking the owner for the paint color. And she was nice enough to go find the can of paint in the basement. So I guess I have horrific taste in decor - yeah, right. \n\nThe coffee is great and a nice change from the usual options. Their red-eye does the job superbly. I don't find it any more expensive than anywhere else I get quality coffee - in fact, I thought it was a bit cheaper. I'm typically not a tea drinker but their selection is great and I have ended up heading back over midday for something different. My only wish is that they would have a stevia option along with the sugar, simple syrup, and splenda at the add-in's bar. I am sugar free but only use stevia. Very few places have it, but they really stand out when they do. Luckily I live close enough to just go back home and add it.\n\nLooks like the people working there in the beginning had attitude. I had not been in until about a month ago but have had no issues with anyone - and I've got a pretty darn low tolerance for that sort of thing.\n\nOverall they are friendly, have quality coffee and tea, and are reasonably priced.

Nice, open atmosphere. Freshly baked scones with delicious clotted cream and the Americano was superb - all at a reasonable price. AND they accept credit cards with a reliable wifi! As a grad student who gets the most work done at cafes early in the mornings, Steap and Grind appeared to be an awesome find.\n\nI came here around 8am on a weekday to get some work done. There was no one at the counter, but I saw that there was one patron sitting and getting some work done so I thought the barista must have just gone to the bathroom or something. \n\nEventually, he came out (I waited probably about 5 minutes), took my order. Mediocre service - definitely not anywhere near rude, but mediocre. My multiple \"thank yous\" were returned with no response. But I am not the type to be picky about mediocre service - and the scone and coffee were enough for me to forget about the mediocre service.\n\nI plopped down to do some work, and this is where things got a little funny for me. I saw that the same barista who had given me mediocre service was giving SUPERB service to everyone who walked in the door. I heard him say multiple times - \"No, thank YOU\" to customers' \"thank yous.\" I sat there for 2 hours to do work, and he made sure to go out of his way to say \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" and \"have a good one!\" to everyone who left the cafe.\n\nAgain, something small I noticed, but shrugged off. It's not that big of a deal. Maybe he just needed time to wake up.\n\nAbout an hour and a half into my work, the same barista came around and asked everyone around me if he could take their plate but blatantly skipped me. My plate was empty. He asked if he could take the plate to the customer next to me who still had some of her pastry left. And then he went onto ask the customer on the other side of me. I was preparing to give him my plate had he not skipped me. At this point, I felt like there was some sort of discrimination in his service, but again, maybe it's just coincidence.\n\nI put my plate and coffee cup away - he looked up to see me pack up and get up - and then walked out the door to no \"have a good day\" or \"good bye\" or \"thank you\". I had sat there for 2 hours listening to him be overly chipper and friendly to everyone else.\n\nSeriously, this doesn't sound like the biggest deal (and it really isn't). I am ok with mediocre service as long as the mediocre service is equal. \n\nI really dislike it when people play the race card but it is true that I was the only minority customer who had walked in the time frame that I was sitting in the cafe.\n\nOther plausible explanations for his discriminatory behavior toward me:\n- I probably looked the youngest out of everyone else there (although I probably wasn't)\n- Maybe I looked like his ex-girlfriend?\n- Maybe I reminded him of a customer who gave him a hard time\n- Maybe he doesn't like people wearing blue skirts (I was the only one in a blue skirt)\n\nRegardless. It left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because the scone and the coffee left my taste buds wanting for more. It is very plausible that today was just an off-day.

I always want to support small coffee shops, but most in the area are too hip to take credit cards or open before 7am.

I called ahead to make sure they took credit cards, yet when I arrived their credit card system was down. Not a big deal, as I'm sure they just didn't know at the time. Eventually I had to pay cash for my order, which took quite sometime to finish.\n\nAlso, apparently they have to run into a separate back room to prepare a bagel with cream cheese. I only saw three listed bagels on their little board, poppy seed, something else, and salt.  I ordered the salt bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The Americano was just ok, and the bagel was bad; it was like the texture of a stale soft pretzel.  I don't think I've ever disliked a bagel more than this particular bagel...maybe it was just a bad bagel day.\n\nI may give them another chance, but I was a little put off by the lack of sympathy and concern for me, the customer, as I waited around for 10 minutes just to pay cash.  They seemed rather unapologetic and lethargic in dealing with the payment issue; thank goodness they didn't have a line of people.  My last tip is for the \"barista\", you literally have any coffee drink you can imagine at your finger tips...don't bring a cream and sugar infused iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts to work.

I really want to try other drink flavors, but I can't give up the yogurt green tea. I might have to order 2 drinks from now on...\n\nUpdate: Golden Oolong milk tea (hot) is GREAT too!!! My go to drink for the winter. The lychee punch (cold) is sweet, flavorful, and perfect for the summer :).\n\nAlso, I know the macarons look good in the fridge, but skip it. They are small, overpriced, too sweet, and the flavor is mediocre. Just stick with the drink and go else where for your macarons and desserts.", "date": "2014-08-17 05:47:18", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 31, "average_stars": 3.49, "yelping_since": "2012-08-12 17:15:32"}}

Last time the toppings were in jars so that customers could see and taste test what they were. Also, there was very limited options in toppings. Unlike Teado, they don't offer a lot of options for jellies. My favorite jellies are mango and lychee which they didn't have but other places I've been to like Teado and SnoCream (see review) did. What I did like was the amount of options they gave you in terms of customizing your order. They have a specific scale on how much ice you want and how much sugar/sweetness you wanted. This is very helpful for those picky customers like me. In terms of flavor, I got the coconut milk tea with boba and my friend got the regular milk tea with boba. The tapioca bobas were al dente, not too mushy and not too hard. The flavor was also good for both drinks. They also had a good variety of flavors but what I wish they would elaborate on their menus what was in each drink like flavors and toppings etc. The cashier was very helpful and tentative of our orders and they came out correctly. The atmosphere is very modern, like Teado, and they had a good seating layout with booths in the back of the room. They also had options for snacks which I didn't try but would like to in the future. Fun Fu Teas is a great place to take people unfamiliar with boba tea as well as boba connoisseurs like myself. But with that said, I still prefer Teado (passion fruit green tea with mango and lychee jellies are too addictive).", "date": "2015-12-19 05:33:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 273, "average_stars": 3.63, "yelping_since": "2015-04-17 00:14:07"}}

Boba tea just felt right to us, even though it was a chilly day. I personally wanted to come here to try the macarons because I had my heart set on those yummy pastries for dessert. \n\nAtmosphere:\nOne of the more spacious boba tea shops in Chinatown. When I first walked in, it looked like it would be a trendy bar in the city except that they sell boba tea and bakery goods. The place was clean and also relatively empty because it was midday. The lighting is different in different areas of the shop. There are black lights in some areas while other areas have dim lighting for playing games like Jenga or Uno. Overall, the place is dimly lit for a boba tea shop, but I am pretty sure it was their intention to create this certain ambiance. \n\nFood/Drinks:\nMy friends ordered coconut milk tea and KF oolong tea while I ordered the pumpkin oolong milk tea. I like boba tea shops that allow customers to customize the sweetness levels of the drinks. We all ordered the drinks with full sugar and it wasn't over sweet. My first friend ordered her drink and a tiramisu to go. Like me, my second friend wanted macarons too so she ordered 6 macarons: rose, matcha, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, and raspberry. I only got 2 macarons (pistachio and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) because they were $2.50 each. They were a bit sweet for my liking but I still ate them both. Also, I am confused as to why the macarons aren't advertised well. The price of the macarons are clearly posted on a make shift sign in big font. Yet, the flavors of the macarons are posted in small font on the side of the metal bar frame on an even smaller make shift sign. Wouldn't it make sense to print a big make shift sign of the available flavors and it posted right next to the make shift sign with the price?? And also possibly label each flavor on the shelves where people can clearly read them accordingly?\n\nPrice: \nAs I mentioned before, the macarons were $2.50 each. The price of boba tea here is typical of boba tea shops (between $2.50-$4 for medium size) so it's relatively in expensive. However, they do charge 50 cents extra for boba, which I personally do not like. I have been to many successful boba tea shops that do not have to charge extra for boba and they are the places I always go back to. I can understand charging extra for extra toppings, but bobas should be universally served at no charge. It seems to be the trend for getting boba tea shops in Chinatown Philly. I also found it odd that the cashier put the macarons in a cup. Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. \n\nService:\nThe staff seems friendly but a bit offstandish. I understand it was the middle of the day, but the cashier who was taking orders didn't seem to care about servicing customers in a timely order. When my friend was ordering her macarons, the cashier rudely cut her off mid sentence and asked how many she was getting. After she took her drink order and order for macarons, she put the macarons in a boba tea cup and walked away to seal the cup. When she came back, she was just standing there purposely not taking my order even though I was clearly ready to order. i just stood there and stared at her for 30 seconds until she looked up from doing nothing but ignoring me. she then replied \"next\" as if I weren't standing there the whole time waiting to order.  No greeting at all preceding her \"what are you getting\" comment. So, I told her \"Can I get a  medium pumpkin oolong milk tea with full sug....\" when she rudely cut me off and told me my total. So, I promptly tell her \"I'm not done yet. I also want 2 macarons - 1 pistachio and 1 creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\" She tells me my new total and walks away with my cup of macarons to seal it while another lady who was standing near by tenders my cash. \n\nIt's a good thing i know how to make my own boba tea at home.

The staple drink I get is the Yogurt Lemonade, a lighter supplement to milk tea. It's a blend of lemonade with an asian yogurt drink, definitely worth trying. An even healthier alternative would be the Yogurt Orange; however, they run out of those a lot. \n\nWith milk tea's, I usually opt for the Kung Fu Milk Tea. It's definitely their classic drink, and it never seems to disappoint. I even get two sometimes a night, but I would recommend one as it feels a bit heavy after finishing a large. I've also tried their almond milk tea, which is a bit on the sweeter side. These drinks are definitely great, and they're consistently made well every time. If you plan on saving your drink for later, be sure to get no ice and no boba. I tend to get no ice either way as it leaves more space for the actual drink!\n\nService here is great. They only not operate the store efficiently, but they take good care of the place too. There have been many times I've seen customers leave cups behind, but the workers do a diligent job cleaning up after. I've even witnessed an employee shoveling snow and ice from the front to ensure no one gets injured.

Just as I was about to give up and get a breakfast sandy from Wawa, I noticed the little sidewalk sign for Luna Caf\u00e9. Though small and busy, I noticed a table leaving, so I decided to take the plunge.\n\nI was riding solo and dining-in (apparently take-out is a thing here). They asked if I wanted to sit at the bar in the back. I was shocked, given the size of the small front dining area, that Luna Caf\u00e9 had a bar, but hey? Why not? Well, to my surprise the bar what not remotely what I expected. It was small bar, more of a shelf really, lining a narrow passageway to an emergency exit/ cleaning closet. It was completely secluded and separate from the rest of the caf\u00e9, and I was the only one back there. I was a little confused, because when I walked in, there was a small table for two at the front. When I took my bar seat at the back, I almost felt like I was put there because I was ugly or something, hidden from the rest of the public. I'm used to dining alone, but I still enjoy the company of others. It was bizarre to be on the outside looking in, and I think the service staff nearly forgot me a handful of times.\n\nSpeaking of the service, it wasn't bad but it wasn't overly great either. I guess I was just a little salty about being sat, secluded by myself.\n\nI ordered the pancakes ($10) with chocolate chips ($2 up charge), and a side of bacon ($3). The bacon was very greasy, and I would have liked it a bit crispier. Everyone has different bacon opinions though. The pancakes were chock-full of chips (see what I did there). They weren't super fluffy, but I could tell they were hot and homemade. They definitely satiated my cravings, though I think the $12 price tag is a little on the high end.\n\nLuna Caf\u00e9 has a cute little set-up for a quick morning bite, and it's located in the heart of Old City, walking distance from great sights and shops. It's about 100 steps from the 2nd and Market stop on the Market-Frankford Line, so public transport is your best bet in getting here. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come here again.

We placed our orders: a chicken wrap, a turkey wrap and a spicy chick pea burger - substituting fries for the salad with the burger. \n\nIt took a little longer than expected to be delivered - and when it was, it was with a \"plop\" on our table... one person in our party noticed that he did not have salad dressing (neither did I, but I will get to that in a minute).  He asked the waitress if he could have dressing, and she said it was already on his salad. He glanced at his salad and politely said that he didn't think there was. When he met the waitress' gaze again, she literally SNAPPED, \"Yes, it is! I can see it from here!\" \n\nDuring the exchange, I was wryly eyeing my salad - which by the way was lovely, but as barren as the Sahara when it came to dressing. I considered daring her to find the salad dressing on mine just to prove the point, but I demurred.  It didn't matter really since I had ordered fries as a substitute anyway. At this point I intervened in the Great Vinaigrette Debate that was playing out at the table with a request for the fries that I ordered. The waitress did apologize for that then asked if she should bring extra salad dressing to the table. Unfortunately, I was annoyed at this point and sharply replied \"Yes.\" \n\nWe began to eat our lunch and from the back of the cafe we could hear discussion about the fries.

I called the day before to move up my reservation by an hour, and they were very accommodating. One of my friends arrived early, and they seated him at a table way in the back. It was a little odd, because it was the only table down a long hallway past the kitchen. I guess it was nice to have our own area, but I would have preferred to be in the main dining area.\n\nThe menu was heavily focused on breakfast food. In hindsight, I think they actually might have given us the breakfast menus because the brunch menu online has a lot of sandwiches listed that were definitely not on our menus. I usually prefer lunch food at brunch, but I do like eggs benedict, so I went with that. Their \"Norwegian Eggs Jefferson\" is eggs benedict with salmon, and it was pretty good. What I did not like about the dish was the \"biscuits\" it was served on. The biscuits tasted like really crumbly dry cornbread...gross! Also, the eggs were overcooked so that the yolks were solid. I like runny yolks with my benedict, so I was disappointed. The salmon was very good but I was surprised that it came fully cooked. I expected lox because the salmon was described as house-cured on the menu, but it still tasted very good so no complaints there. It was served with a side of fresh fruit salad that included apples, grapefruit, and oranges. I was a big fan of the fruit salad, but unfortunately the hollandaise sauce from my benedict overflowed onto the fruit salad, so it all got mixed together. It still tasted ok, though. My friends were also happy with their meals but not overly impressed. It's a BYOB, so I brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate my move to NY. We drank it straight because it was decent quality, and I didn't want to dilute it with OJ, but you can order glasses or pitchers of orange juice if you want to make mimosas.\n\nThe service was a little slow, but I think that might have been because we were in that back area.

Incredibly helpful.\n- (Mostly) local sourcing, healthy, yet creative food options.\n- Free champagne during grand opening. They had me at free champagne.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement.\n\n- Paper napkins + uncovered tea lights = fire hazard. Glad I could demonstrate that to them early in their new adventure. I AM THE WORST. Luna Caf\u00e9, please once again accept my apologies for thinking that fanning a napkin on fire with my bill folder was a good idea.\n- Food execution (see next three bullet points).\n- Latke Luna - a little more salt/spice/flavor on the actual latkes. However, both dipping sauces were quite nice.\n- Fritto Misto - Menu said \"lightly fried,\" but it wasn't quite \"lightly\" enough. The fish they used was great and was overshadowed by too much breading.\n- Caprese Focaccia Panini - Wonderful flavors, but ours was cold in the middle. Sad face.\n\nDefinitely going to come back.

The appearance was thick enough (only at $7 plus extra for gluten-free bread) to suffice for a meal, but I got curious and hungry while waiting for my delicious sandwich and ordered their loaded potatoes (off my diet, but, I'm not in Philly often, so why not sample the local gourmet?)\n\nThe wait staff (friendly young woman named Brynna, I didn't catch the young man's name) were friendly, nice, and boy, were they busy! \n\nBack to the meal, the loaded potatoes did not disappoint! Oftentimes, restaurants tend to \"overload\" their potatoes or nachos with too much cheese, too much sour cream, too much grease and they come out soggy; not so with this portion. Grease level was just high enough for flavor yet not high enough to bring on instant indigestion. Portion size was also adequate: not too small, not overdone, a quality product. Brynna had shared with me that they had recently changed the recipe, so it shows that they are also reflective in continuing to refine their art.\n\nI am a very tough critic and they earned a 4.5 out of 5 from me, which rounds up to a 5.

Both omelette got potatoes and multigrain toast on the side. We also got 3 mini pancakes. I especially asked my omelette to be well cooked but in the end, I was able to see the egg white and yellow sides pretty shiny and couldn't eat 1/3of it... Also I had a piece of avocado inside my omelet and my husband had none, but he had onions? Some mix and match going on in there... I am not a fan of pancakes, so I would say they were OK.

It's hard to find such spacious, warmly-decorated, tasteful cafes on the east coast these days.  Chapterhouse also has no problem with lingering customers - buy a cup of something, have a seat, and spend a few hours reading if you like.  The coffee is good, and the pastries are pretty good as well.\n\nCons:  First and foremost, their espresso drinks are watery.  Down the street from Chapterhouse is a Starbucks - every morning, Chapterhouse is fairly empty while Starbucks has a line going out the door.  This is because Starbucks' espresso drinks are stronger and more flavorful.  (If even Starbucks has better espresso offerings than you do, you know you're doing something wrong.)\n\nChapterhouse is hipster hell.  I don't object to the crowd, or the age of the crowd - rather, I object to the exclusivity and clique-ishness of it.  I've been going to Chapterhouse several times a week for two years, and no one there knows my name or has even once asked.  Maybe this is because I'm a little older than the crowd there, or for some other reason. Occasionally, you get awful, slow, cold-shouldered service there.  Yesterday I went to Chapterhouse for a regular afternoon tea (their tea is terrible, by the way), and after waiting several minutes for the barista to finish a personal conversation with a patron, I was greeted by cold, abrupt service.  She clearly felt I was wasting her time, perhaps because I wasn't part of the \"in\" crowd.  After she was done with me, she proceeded to warmly and happily greet everyone who came in after me, because they were part of the \"in\" crowd.  Overall, it made me feel unwelcome and lonely.\n\nIn short, Chapterhouse is a nice place for the occasional coffee, and a good place if you plan to go out with a few friends.  But if you want good espresso look elsewhere.  If you want to feel like a regular who's welcome, definitely go elsewhere.

As far as I'm concerned, it's the best coffee shop in the (slightly extended) Center City Philadelphia area. There are equally good coffee shops in other neighborhoods.\n\nChapterhouse has everything you'd expect in a good coffeeshop; fair-trade, organic coffee made with purified water, inexpensive (50 cent) refills, soy milk, free wi-fi, ample seating (there's actually a stairway to the second floor tucked in the back), and an ambient iPod mix that only comes out of the background when you want it to. Additionally, they have a small food menu including, but not limited to, a vegan wrap and desserts. It's mostly tables but there are a few cozy chairs and a small bar facing the outside window. You can even bring your dog in.\n\nLike most coffee shops, there's a lot of one person with a laptop to a table going on, and an unspoken, unofficial rule of library-like silence. So unless you're completely uninhibited, and don't mind others listening in on your conversation, this is probably not the best place to break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend. But a very good place to update your Facebook status to \"single.\" If you don't have a laptop, or a girlfriend to break up with, there are plenty of books and magazines to pretend you're reading in between glancing up at who just walked in the door.\n\nOverall it's a great alternative to the Starbucks on the same block.", "date": "2012-01-26 18:49:45", "useful": 2, "funny": 6, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 249, "average_stars": 3.87, "yelping_since": "2012-01-26 11:18:30"}}

I used to live two blocks away from Chapterhouse, and it was my go-to coffee place for a year and a half. Whenever I go there with someone new, I usually point out (wistfully!) the stool at the counter by the window where I wrote a novel once. Memreez!\n\nOK, but beyond that, Chapterhouse is pretty kickass. First of all, the atmosphere is laid-back, the baristas are chill (there's a couple in particular who I'm always glad to see when I make it back to Philly for a visit), there's always good music playing (although I think I've now heard enough Ratatat to last two lifetimes), and the art gallery aspect is a nice touch. Furthermore, the owners are frequently present, friendly, and helping out in the space, so you know that any issues will be addressed.\n\nI get that there are some people who don't dig a place that allows dogs, has couches and board games, and is just as often full of chit-chat as it is full of people with their eyes glued to their Macbooks. But this gives it the feel of being someone's home (there's a fireplace, for Pete's sake), which makes it a lot more welcoming than a clinical get-your-coffee-and-go kind of location. If you want one of those, you can walk half a block up to 9th and South and no one will think less of you. (Well, I won't, at least. Well, maybe a tiny bit.)\n\nAs for the menu: omg BERRY MOCHA. It's delicious cold and better hot, and you should be drinking one right now. The other specialty lattes are delicious and decently priced, the iced tea sodas are unique, and all the other standard drinks can usually be manipulated one way or another if you want. I don't generally go for the food (a tad pricey), but what I've sampled is good; the pastries can be a little bit hit or miss. (Best to get them around 11 am, after they've arrived and had time to thaw a little bit, especially the squares.) And: a nice varied tea selection.\n\nThere are a couple qualms: a high credit card minimum, a basement space that isn't very inviting (there used to be vintage clothing sales down there before they converted it; aw), and occasionally (weekends) it is downright impossible to get a seat. But as coffeeshops go, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more versatile, interesting, and welcoming one. \n\nThis is exactly the kind of place I want to open someday.

Still, it's not so stuffy that I feel badly answering my cell phone if it rings.  Another perk: free wi-fi!  Awesome for those days when I need Internet to get my work done (and equally great for those I'm-so-sick-of-studying moments, to provide a welcome distraction).\n\nAs I've mentioned in my other reviews, I am not a coffee drinker.  Friends do like their coffee, but I think their espresso drinks are even more well-loved.  My boyfriend likes their Mexican mocha.  My favorite drink is the soy chai.  For some reason, Chapterhouse's soy chai is my favorite chai in all of Philadelphia.  I don't know what the owner does to make it taste different, but it's consistently delicious.  They also have tasty sandwiches and ridiculously good cookies.  The brownies and various other bars are hit or miss.\n\nThough it's crowded and sometimes annoying, I will continue to venture out of East Falls to visit Chapterhouse.

The basement can get really noisy with people stomping on the basement doors from the street. \n\nI also am unsure if I like the vibe I get from the workers anymore. They used to be friendly, but recently everyone has an \"I am too cool for you\" attitude, with little to no friendliness. I barely get a greeting when I walk in the door.

I wonder how often he does that, since there seem to be no references to the Ron Paul revolution in the current reviews. Then again, maybe Philly hipsters like Ron Paul. \n\nIn any case, this review is emphatically NOT based on my feelings about the Chapterhouse's proud libertarianism.

When you approach the counter you will be greeted warmly and given time to choose what you'd like to order.  There are some some independently owned cafes where yelpers like to complain about snobby hipsters on the other side of the counter.  This is not one of those cafes.  Also at times I've also received helpful recommendations from the barista when I can't make up my mind, which is frequently the case. From my experiences I've found the coffee to be good, not amazing, but just solidly good.\n\nThe teas however are another thing altogether and something I would highly recommend trying out. They are served in a bag and they have a decent variety, especially for green, white and herbal teas.\n\nChapterhouse has a decent variety of bagels, however they frequently run out so be prepared to have an alternative choice.  Also the cream cheese, of which there are several varieties, is served in a little metal cup so you get to decide how much you want.  As to non bagel options, don't be afraid to try any variety of scone or brownie, for they are delicious.  The sandwiches are slightly pricey for the neighborhood but will not disappoint.\n\nNow for the atmosphere. This is an extremely important aspect of a cafe if you feel as though you would like to have a seat.  I have yet to take issue with any of their music, which for the most part is a fairly pleasant sounding variety of indie rock.  The overall volume of the cafe beyond the music is extremely quiet and the back room with huge windows overlooking the garden feels like a library.   I felt a bit uncomfortable moving my noisy metal chair back there on the polished concrete floor.\n\nSo to sum up, will I go back, yes.

I know what it's like and allowed him to continue his chores till finally after five minutes he turned around and whipped out \"What?!\". I said \"Um... A bagel with cream cheese.\" He sighed and pointed to an empty basket. I nodded and he said, \"What else?\". I just smiled, waved and walked out. He might had mumbled something as I left but I made it clear that he failed to do a simple task.

I had the Bibam Bap with seitan -- it was listed as vegan, or so I thought. The food was good enough to bring me back again tonight....\n\nAnd despite a good experience last week, tonight the Bubble House experience was HORRENDOUS.  I have no idea what happened between last week and this week.  First off, tonight we were ignored by several employees before finally being seated by a friendly waitress.  She meant well and could not have been responsible for the service disaster that followed.  \n\nThey were completely out of seitan, the basis for many of the veg versions of the dishes. That was a disappointment but we figured we'd go for tofu.  Unfortunately the waitress then informed us that the items listed as vegan, such as the Bibam Bap that I ate last time, weren't actually vegan but contained FISH SAUCE!!!! I had no idea last week that I was eating something with fish sauce! But I guess I should have been suspicious because even the PORK TENDERLOIN is listed as a veg option. If it says vegan or veg on the menu, assume the opposite.\n\nThe spring rolls came out and were pretty good, but small and quite costly at $7 for 2 rolls cut in half.  We ordered a $14 bowl of red curry with tofu and it took MORE THAN AN HOUR for it to come.  Just as we were about to walk out of the restaurant in exasperation, the food arrived after 10 pm (we had come in 10 minutes before 9).  The waitress was extremely apologetic and explained that the stoves were broken.  Once the food got there we asked for spoons, and the poor waitress then circled the rest. 3 times with a panicked look on her face trying to find a spoon.  Apparently Bubble House doesn't have spoons.  She found a plastic chinese restaurant egg drop soup style spoon and sheepishly put it on our table and then ran away.  We then ate INCREDIBLY spicy red curry with a plastic soup spoon while we panted like dogs due to the heat of the food.  For $14 no rice was served separately, but a few grains were pre-mixed in.\n\nOverall, terrible service (with the exception of the female waitresses who seem to doing their best on a sinking ship), and food that is too little in quantity, too spicy, and way too expensive for what you get.

I should not neglect to mention, however, that they did fix our raw meat problem...they magically turned it into rubber! I didn't know that could be done--amazing!\n\nYou would think that at a place called \"Bubble House\" you could at least get some decent bubble tea. Boy, was I mistaken.

Instead of getting the frosted (blended) bubble tea that we anticipated, we got some severely watered-down concoction...and surprisingly enough, the tapioca balls were entirely undercooked.

Ironically, that was probably the best dish we got.\n\nAnd to top it off, they wouldn't allow us to use the Restaurant.com certificate that we had, even though we ordered well more than the $50 min spend (\"Valid for food only. Excludes alcohol.\") specified in the certificate. Who knew bubble tea was not considered food. Oh wait, I forgot, that's right, the bubbles were made from an inedible, gummy substance not qualified to be called food! So after already getting the check, wrapping up my food & giving the waitress my credit card, I was forced to order something else and wait another 20 mins because I was short a WHOLE $2!

I recall the grease literally dripping down and forming a puddle on the plate while my boyfriend was struggling to eat it. He said it was almost nauseating to eat. I tried it too, and noticed that the fried ingredients in the sandwich, most noticeably the hash browns, were fried in OLD oil. Man, that scent was bad. \n\nSame applied for the second item, the regular breakfast plate; the main part was a biscuit sandwich with eggs and bacon. The biscuit was, wait for it.. OVERWHELMINGLY MILKY and buttery, which was also nauseating to me, and of course, the hash browns.. No need to repeat myself. The few bites of side salad were good though, but you can't really go wrong with veggies. \n\nThe bad experience with the food basically ruined the mocha latte.

I was drawn to this place one day when I wanted brunch food right after my monthly visit to the St. Johh Neumann shrine nearby.  The space is quite small, like every thing else in this part of the city and the age of the building really shows, but for this little coffee house it works perfectly.  And  they certainly have garnered quite a following especially with the solid four star rating on Yelp.  The prices are quite on the expensive side just as a heads up but the flavor and quality is all there.  I ordered the One Shot Breakfast Sandwich which is scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  I added sausage to it because every breakfast sandwich needed sausage, bacon, or ham.  It's one of those unwritten rules.    The sandwich will set you back $7.75 and some change which like I said before is pricey but I didn't mind because it was pretty big and they cooked in perfectly.  The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy.  I'm not kidding it really was light and fluffy and the sausage didn't taste like Jimmy Dean's.  At that price point I should have expected it but I was still pleasantly surprised.  I paired my sandwich with a gingerbread orange tea from Tea Source and it was heavenly.  It was sweet and aromatic with just the right amount of citrus flavor which I associate with a good brunch drink.  If you're not a tea aficionado One Shot serves the best java with their nice selection from Stumptown Coffee.  You can tell that their baristas truly know what's up.  I'm glad I made my way to this coffee shop.  It's a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or a combination of both.

I was psyched to see a new, full brunch menu, even though there were limited vegan options and all the great bagel sandwiches were gone. We ordered the tofu scramble and a tomato soup. It was prepared by someone who obviously just learned what vegan was yesterday. Oil city, everything, had sooo much oil. Its like they replaced any dairy or egg element with oil to compensate. Ew.  I've never seen tomato soup with a 1/4 inch  film of oil on the top. Totally gross. I took 2 spoonfuls and decided I didn't want to barf later, so I stopped.

Bryana ordered the bagel topped with creme cheese, crushed nuts, and drizzled with honey. One look brings on a doling mouth and a bit of envy. I ordered a weird sandwich: bacon egg and mac-n-cheese. This sounds odd, but makes the perfect meal, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Sure, you quickly become a cheese gooey mess, but I don't remember the last time I had so much fun doing so. I believe that this sandwhich is their flagship food, and certainly should be enjoyed on the fluffy and buttery brioches roll. One shot also offers house made treats like biscotti, cookies, and such.\n\nBottom line: I think this is a love it or hate it place. Coffee is a bit pricey, while food is reasonable.

Its just not the kind of service I would've predicted from such an otherwise solid establishment - especially when other, closer-to-home coffee shop options are available - doesn't competition drive some sense of flexibility or courtesy to the customer - its Monday morning for all of us, right? $4 for a bagel and 12oz. of coffee is still delivering a substantial profit no matter what time of day you're ordering it. \nI ended up ordering a tofu breakfast burrito (I'm vegan, it was admittedly good), and the coffee is always good (kinda hard to \"F\" up Stumptown brews anyway), but after that experience, my order stopped there.

I also stalked One Shot Cafe's instagram and was basically drooling over their posts of housemade cronuts, other baked goods, and brunch specials.\n\nMy boyfriend and I actually were staying at the opposite end of the city, but we woke up early and made the 45-60 minute trek because I had my mind set on it. One Shot is tucked away in a corner in a transitioning neighborhood; it's a hidden treasure. It is a narrow cafe with some plush cushion seating and outdoor tables. Unbeknownst to me, there is also an upstairs area with more seating that looks like the perfect spot to cozy up with a cup of coffee or tea.\n\nOne Shot has a glass case displaying their freshly baked goods, an extensive coffee menu above, AND an actual food menu. My boyfriend and I both ordered off their daily specials menu, but honestly, I wanted to try everything on their regular menu as well. They have a beautiful menu featuring drink specials that is designed by an artist each week (which I learned from stalking their Instagram) hanging behind the cashier, and this week's theme was Hawai'i. \n\nThe boyfriend opted for the Italian pork roll breakfast burrito (scrambled eggs, potatoes, sauteed onion, cheddar, long hots, served with sweet pepper salsa & garden greens). I got the croissant french toast with mixed berry compote, sweet butter, & maple syrup and an iced lavender blueberry latte (2 shots hairbender sweetened with lavender & blueberry syrup), also a special for the week. \n\nThe croissant french toast wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. The berry compote provided a sweet and tart complement to the buttery croissant. However, I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend's breakfast burrito -- the real star of the show. The burrito was slightly grilled on each side so that the tortilla had a bit of a crunch. The potatoes were also shredded hashed browns that were in the contents of the burrito rather than on the side as an afterthought. I started wishing I had gotten the breakfast burrito too. The iced latte was strong in blueberry flavor (not so much lavender) and was extremely refreshing. One sip definitely woke me up.\n\nThere were a few benches outside, but we were able to score a corner sofa seat. It was calm for a Saturday around noon, but shortly after we ordered, a line soon developed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and offering their recommendations when we were unsure of what to pick. My only gripe was that the prices were a bit steep. The breakfast for the two of us and the iced latte ended up being close to $30.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend One Shot to anyone who visits Philly, and I will certainly be back.

It really embodies Northern Liberties and has evolved much in the same way our neighborhood has.  Once tucked away on Liberties walk and a bit hidden and flying under the radar, it moved to a new location on West George and American and it just blossomed, grew into its own.  Much like our neighborhood.\n\nI tend to wax poetically about small businesses that I really love, and One Shot is no exception.  I also have quite a warm spot in my heart for the place too, as it was where my baby shower took place.  Yep!  Did you know that One Shot's second floor can be rented for private events?  It is absolute perfection for a small, intimate affair. (baby or bridal shower, birthday party, special luncheon just because?) From soup to nuts, One Shot and owner Rebecca made it the most splendid, adorable affair.  The whole event went without a hitch, the service was impeccable, friendly and the menu crafted especially for the event was perfection (there was this caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, and a small pat\u00e9 chinois- shepherd's pie - a nod to my french canadian heritage, and the most yummy macarons, amongst other delicious tidbits that were to die for!).   \n\n It doesn't hurt that the whole place is so uniquely gorgeous.  The artwork, the lighting, repurposed vintage items, the open space design that still makes the place feel cozy and personal, the beautiful bathrooms (seriously beautiful bathrooms), the cute curved booths on the first floor and the seating upstairs, it just works, you know?  \n\nThe coffee is super strong  (like I like it) and the food is killer.  Go there early in the morning and experience their baked goods hot and fresh out of the oven.  This morning, for example, had a blueberry and peach scone that rocked my world.  It's the little things.  All their baked goods are super yummy, and don't get me started on their breakfast, brunch menu - sweet baby jesus - their ultimate breakfast sandwich contains some of my most favorite items on earth: a brioche bun, brie, bacon, hash brown and two fried eggs.  Hello lover.  Breakfast of champions right there.  Just give it a whirl, you won't ever look back.\n\nIt's the perfect place to grab a quick dose of caffeine, or while away your hours as you nibble on a croissant and get caught up on your blog lovin', or go upstairs where it's quieter with one of their daily crafted non-caffeinated options and catch up on your reading (with a book, not a kindle).", "date": "2013-08-24 12:56:33", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 371, "average_stars": 3.39, "yelping_since": "2008-12-15 23:29:58"}}

It's kind of like reviewing a movie - how you feel about it is not only based on THEIR effort, the cinematography, the writing, the casting, etc etc... it's also based on everything you've been through in your life up until the day you see the movie.  Reviewing coffee shops - not an objective practice in any way.  The reviews help, sure, especially if all 30 of them say, \"I got food poisoning from the camembert quiche.\"  Sure, take THEM to heart. But don't weigh too heavily in general.\n\nThat said, let me get down from my soap box and talk about One Shot.  I really like it there.  Sometimes, I am treated like a queen (mostly, when I go see my beautiful friend Kelly who I love a lot and who I think is a great barista), and sometimes I am treated like a slightly annoying citizen.  But that's life, and I do not need my ass kissed 24/7, even in the service industry.  (If you think a barista's job is to make you feel like the most important little latte drinking princess in the world, I suggest you buy a coffee maker.)  The coffee/espresso is lovely and does what it's supposed to, like a charm.  The food is inventive and consistently prepared, and the prices are competitive.  The music is enjoyable and the vibe is deliciously relaxed, especially for a shop that resides in a shiny, glossed over, gentrified mini-mall in the middle of a neighborhood halfway between Hipster Heaven and Get Out, We Were Here First.  I like when the sun spills into the windows onto the slouchy, old furniture.  I like to go when I can't look at my work laptop anymore and I need a tiny little dose of Yay Life Rules.

I guess it won't matter to them though, because there seems to be an endless parade of the tattooed hip to spend money there all the same.\n\nTwo instances come to mind.\n\nOn a hot day, I wanted a really cold drink.  I chose the beet juice from the open cooler in the front - it didn't really seem very cold, so I asked if I could have some ice for it.  This drink costs almost $7, but the woman at the counter had the gall to charge me 50 cents for it.  Yeah, I know, it's only 50 cents, but come on.  I am spending $7 for the drink, not to mention the rest of the food we got.  Last I heard, ice wasn't a very expensive item for restaurants to supply. Most will just give it to you for free.\n\nAlso, another time it was winter, and I got one of their fancy overpriced hot drink specials on the specials board.  When I took my first sip, it was kind of luke warm.  I asked if they could just please pop it in the microwave for me to heat it up a bit.  The woman (I think one of the owners) looked at me with a face of HORROR and spit out her words in disgust UGHHHH!!!!  We don't have a MICROWAVE HERE!!!!!!!!!!   So I asked what she could do for me, she said UGH!!! I GUESS I CAN PUT A SHOT OF ESPRESSO IN THERE, BUT THATS IT!!!!!!!!\n\nSo the drink I probably paid over $5 for, which was lukewarm, and SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICELY REMADE FOR ME, if you didn't have a microwave, was made 1% warmer with the addition of espresso.

Somehow the excellent food, quality espresso beverages and well thought out d\u00e9cor amassed in a perfect permutation, making our breakfast at One Shot one of the most delightful parts of our recent trip to Philly. \n\nAs I waited at a table by a window I could quickly tell by glancing around that the owners and workers care wholeheartedly about the product they put out and the happiness of their customers. Their dedication, work ethic and contentment were readily apparent by even the most cursory observation. Similarly, a peek at the tables and a glance at the quickly moving line showed one of the most diverse crowds I've ever seen at a coffee house - a real testament to this shop as it appeals to everyone.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not a Philadelphian so I can't come here regularly, and even more unfortunate, we had only popped in to fulfill my morning need for coffee and grab an edible accompaniment, we weren't going to stay for a full lunch. We decided to split the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich (brioche bun, brie, bacon, giant hash brown, two eggs with just enough runniness) and selected our drinks, then Justin went to order while I camped out at the table. When he came back he had one of their Mexican chocolate cronuts with him. It's the little things in life that make the biggest difference and this was no exception - not only because it was an awesome cronut with great flavor and texture and paired well with my cappuccino, but because my partner has impeccable taste and knows exactly what I will like. \n\nAfter we finished our breakfast we took a turn around the caf\u00e9. Both upstairs and downstairs are absolutely adorable. Each vintage element is placed perfectly and seems like it would have a story. The upstairs is much less hectic, has a little library and would be the perfect place to sit and catch up with a girlfriend over brunch. The menus of specials are hand written and decorated on giant butcher paper rolls - love it. Even the downstairs bathroom is beautiful with its old fashioned lace curtain and mock window. \n\nThe concept, design and execution of every aspect of One Shot are perfect.

While I wasn't disappointed with it, it also was nothing to write home about.  With how competitive the coffee market is in Philly, this isn't something I would immediately recommend to a visiting coffee coffee snob.  My girlfriend got a latte that was pretty damn good, and maybe that's One Shot's claim to fame more than anything.  Coffee isn't bad and it's a definite good place to stop in and have a cup - just nothing that I'd be running back to week in and week out.\n\nFood - I got the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich which I thought was going to be phenomenal.  It was very good, but once again, it wasn't quite what I was expecting (in a negative way).  The brioche bun was fairly bland and added little to the overall sandwich while the hashbrown was probably the best part of the entire thing.  Brie wasn't necessarily the best selection of cheese for this sandwich either that lacked a true *oomph* factor.  I was left wanting more in the area of flavor.  I would probably eat this again, but not before trying something different on their menu.  I'd suggest if you're going to One Shot for breakfast, stick to their specials.

Exposed walls, original ceilings, old fashioned light bulbs fashioned into unique lighting fixtures, the whole deal (see pictures).   I ordered the garden bagel and my boyfriend got the ultimate breakfast.  He got an iced coffee with a touch of hazelnut and I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk (dairy milk sensitivity) AND he ordered a maple bacon kronut and i got the glazed kronut.  We took our kronuts to a table near the window and he ranted and raved about the maple bacon (though I dont see the fascination with putting bacon on everything- it still tasted good and to my satisfaction, i couldnt even taste the bacon).  My glazed kronut was good but i think it had something to do with the croissant but it sort of tasted like it was just a stale doughnut.  Either way, they were good enough.  Then the coffees came out and of course we were pleased (though I wouldnt recommend ever getting a cappuccino with almond milk- even if you ARE sensitive to dairy milk, it tastes weird).  The bagel came out quickly with the ultimate breakfast and we were in heaven.  I am from long island and I have yet to eat a bagel here that could even touch long island but this might have been it!

There have been some changes in their management and in my opinion, it has not been for the better.\n\nI have been an avid fan of La Colombe for about 5-years, well before they achieved the popularity they have now. It used to be a much more inviting environment and the staff was always a pleasure to deal with. In the last 6-months, the overall vibe has changed and customer service is much less friendly. \n\nIt seems to me that employees are unhappy and I actually ran into a person who used to work for La Colombe, and had for quite some time, at Rival Bros Coffee on Spruce Street. I asked why they left and it was for that exact reason. They stopped enjoying it and the work environment became a negative space to be in.\n\nSo, here I find myself at One Shot Caf\u00e9 for the second day in a row, drinking a perfect Americano and having a bowl of their carrot cake oatmeal, which I had no idea even existed. No worries, it's not just a bowl of sugar, it is nicely balanced and takes a delicious new perspective to oatmeal. \n\nCustomer service wise, everyone that works here is extremely friendly and they love to talk to their customers. Depending on the day, they might be a little slow making your order, NOT because of lack of effort but because they are in the middle of training some new staff so that they can better accommodate the customers they love very much so be patient, it's worth the wait! \n\nThe location itself is saturated with character and a welcoming patina from the counter made of recycled wood, the preserved original ceiling, the charming booths, and yes, they do have plenty of exposed brick so rest easy hipsters of North Philly. \n\nAll in all, the only reason I would go to La Colombe over One Shot Caf\u00e9 is to fulfill my craving for their French Toast.

I live in a city that attracts coffee enthusiasts from across the country, and I'd trade all of Portland's award-winning specialty roasters and retailers for easier access to a caf\u00e9 like this.\n \nTake 60 seconds to scan the menu overhead and there will be no need to read between the lines: Function Coffee Labs is out to save you from so much as a sip from a subpar cup. This is very, very good coffee. Meticulously sourced, small-batch, artisanal; you could rattle off all the makings of a third wave coffee shop too. But it's not just the espresso (or the coffee shot, or the cortado, or the cappuccino -- oh my god, the cappuccino) that makes me wish FCL were a fixture on my own walk to work.\n \n-Service: Chances are, the owner will be the one behind the bar. Here's what I liked about Ross: he's able to read people. If Instagram is your thing, you can count on a latte that looks too good to drink. If you want to talk about the latest signature drink and grams and fluid ounces and what he's tweaked to dial it in that day, he will happily oblige. It doesn't matter whether you've ordered the same drink for the past decade or if 90% of your counter space is devoted to home brewing gadgets and accessories. There's nobody more down-to-earth, knowledgeable, or contagiously enthusiastic about temperature, technique, purveyors, and flavors. But if you just want your large iced coffee to go, ideally sooner rather than later (since you're running a few minutes behind), he'll hop to it. And in either case, he's bound to remember your name the next time you come in.\n \n-Ambiance: 10/10. Perfect playlists. The happy hum of caffeinated (and soon-to-be caffeinated) people. Just the right amount of miscellaneous background noise. No shortage of green growing things. A variety of tables for slow-sipping, talking, reading, or working. This is the type of place where you can meet someone for a blind date, catch up with a friend, get good work done on your laptop, and/or easily befriend someone sitting a table away.\n \n-Aesthetic (and other bonuses): Ross's fianc\u00e9 and co-owner, Meg, is behind much of FCL's aesthetic appeal. The brightly lit, smartly branded shop has a clear color palette, with broad navy strokes and splashes of white. Copper elements abound, as do pretty pops of turquoise. A chalkboard sign out front speaks to Ross and Meg's combined intelligence and wit; the creative commentary is often as social media worthy as any pourover action shot. The real draw, however, may be the bakery case, which is loaded with the homey and locally sourced, each more irresistible than the next. If none of the day's sweet treats sway you, snack options range from Stroopwafels and bean-to-bar chocolates to RX bars and overnight oats. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on one of the half dozen breakfast sandwiches the caf\u00e9 puts out each morning, don't tell me. You'll break my heart.\n \nAll this to say, if you're lucky enough to have Function Coffee Labs at your fingertips: Go hungry. Go thirsty.

During the warm months it was delightful and we would sometimes sit outside or even sit inside and enjoy all the light that came through.  \n\nDownside: aside from a really nice lady who worked there: Jarmal as I can remember, the rest of the staff was surprisingly off putting.  For such a nice place, I would expect the staff to be the same but everyone aside from previously mentioned Jarmal was not very friendly at all.  For some reason, and I hate to go straight to this, but I felt like since my boyfriend and I werent 'hipster' enough, we werent accepted nor good enough to be friendly to.  You as a reader dont know me very well but trust me when I tell you, I am EXTREMELY nice and friendly and all around jovial to people, especially service people behind the register/counter.  I am beyond appreciative of what they do for me and what they have to go through sometimes with rude customers so I make sure that I am always peachy keen to them.  Lets just say that the majority of the staff at Rocket Cat do not return this positivity to me and to really get down to the point; that's why my boyfriend and I havent returned in several months.\n\nIf Rocket Cat Cafe is reading this- if you put a smile on and be a little nicer and accommodating to your customers, or my HUGE pet peeve: when i say 'thank you', please say your welcome or at the very least acknowledge the kindness of your customers.", "date": "2014-11-15 19:34:38", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 73, "average_stars": 3.75, "yelping_since": "2012-04-05 13:48:30"}}

When you first walk in, you'll get a sense of the relaxed atmosphere and hipster vibes - but not in a bad way at all. The interior of this cafe is absolutely amazing. All of the decorations, as well as the chairs at the little coffee bar, are super unique and antique-looking. There are some nice tables by the windows on the left side of the cafe that give you a nice view of the street which is perfect for people-watching. It was very relaxing and enjoyable to sit, read, and drink my coffee for a while.\n\nOne thing you'll be sure to notice at this cafe is that there are TONS of different drinks! They have all of the classic coffee drinks you'd expect to find in any cafe as well as some unique drink options. There is also a refrigerator in the middle of the cafe that has a lot of vegetarian and vegan food options including the vegan pumpkin whoopie pie - so delicious!\n\nI was so excited that they had a Thai Style Latte on the menu (which comes iced) so I ordered it and it exceeded all of my expectations. Hands down the best Thai Style Latte I've ever had! I also got a piece of the lemon pound cake with icing (which most certainly cancelled out any calories I burned from my cycling class...whoops). It was really yummy and I could tell that it was homemade and freshly baked. \n\nOn the real though, I am seriously considering coming back to get another Thai Style Latte even though I am rarely in this area. It was that good!! Rocket Cat Cafe gets 5/5 stars from me mostly because that latte was so perfect, but also for the awesome ambiance, friendly baristas, and the vegan options! I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area.", "date": "2016-01-22 00:27:31", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 64, "average_stars": 4.34, "yelping_since": "2015-09-27 22:53:42"}}

If this review was taking place four years ago, I probably would've given the RC four stars. They've got fantastic bagels and pastries*. The place is cozy and offers free wi-fi. The coffee is good most of the time. The veggie cream cheese is delicious (I swear they make it from fresh veggies themselves). Drinking the Thai Iced Coffee results in a reaction that will pretty much rival your best childhood Christmas morning ever. \n\nSo what keeps me from giving it four stars? \n\nThe service. It drives me batty. Over the years, I've seen the staff go from okay to flat out terrible. They are super slow, which is sort of forgivable in the late afternoon/evening, a time I associate with unwinding, but not in the morning when my hunger pangs are strong enough to make me want to eat a rock. Or anything else I find strewn about on the sidewalk. And half the time, they seem confused about how to properly toast and prepare a bagel. Within the last year, I've sort of given up on the clueless kids and have resorted to ordering my bagel untoasted, cream cheese on the side, to fix at home myself. It's a lot faster (again, sometimes). \n\nMan, I just want to light a fire under some asses! I know they like to maintain a laid back, I'm-an-artist-and-I-just-don't-care image, but come on. Enough is enough. It isn't that difficult to handle a crowd and some coffee. Skills! Learn them! Please!\n\nAlso, I wish someone would make sure all the staffers knew how to properly serve coffee: no pulling a cup 'til the brew is finished! I don't like drinking the occasional cup of weak brown water! Ever! \n\nDespite the negative things I've mentioned thus far about Rocket Cat, it is a generally swell little coffee shop. My gripes probably will not stop me from utilizing their services. After all, it's just around the corner from my house and how can I pass that up? \n\nThat said, I really want to be able to up the star count on this one. I still have faith in you, Rocket Cat. I welcome you to prove me wrong about my peeves sometime soon.\n\n\n*If you're low on cash, I suggest the day old pastries. They're half price and just as delicious as same day ones.

The basics: Wifi, reasonably priced, good quality coffee, bathroom, adequate lighting--RocketCat actually fails here. This place is dark and moody and the bathroom is sketchy. And the Wifi is INCREDIBLY slow. The coffee was good and reasonably priced. Very limited sugar/milk options at the DIY bar. \n2. Hours: This is a win for RocketCat--6:30-8pm M-F, and 7/8am-8pm on weekends.\n3. Ample seating and tables large enough to be conducive to studying--Meh, RocketCat gets a mere passing grade here--I never have too much trouble getting a table, but there aren't many of a good enough size to study. \n4. Ample outlets: Fail. I think there is one, if you don't get a table near it, I hope your laptop has a decent battery-life. \n5. Decent free/no time limit parking in the vicinity: Fishtown rocks at free parking.\n6. Reasonably priced, healthy food options: Menu was a redeeming feature--good food, reasonable prices. \n7. Free, communal water (really just a perk)--nope \n8. Friendly staff: NOPE. The girl behind the counter acted like I was trying to rip them off when I asked for a refill--because you have to get a mug to get the refills, and I had originally bought a large. Even when I told her that I didn't know and that I didn't mind if she only filled it up as much as a mug, she gave me a bunch of attitude. How was I supposed to know the rules?!? Scheesch.  Since moving to Fishtown, I've learned there are two kinds of hipsters--the very friendly, just into living cheaply, vintage stuff and organic everything (ie: those at Pizza Brain or Johnny Brenda's) OR the super judgmental, too-cool-to-be-friendly types. The latter is what you find working at RocketCat. \n9. Cleanliness: Meh. Its so dark and gloomy, it seems dirty. No one cleans the tables when people leave. The staff looked like they could use a shower too. \n10. No arctic temps from over-air-conditioning: It was still winter, and they still failed at this--too cool for adequate heating too. I remember leaving b/c I was freezing, which is the last thing I want when its also freezing outside--probably why I asked for that refill in the first place. \n\nThe only way I'll go back here is if I REALLY need to study later than 5pm on a weekend.

This would have been kind of tasty if I wanted a peanut butter latte.  But I didn't.  The mochaccino was a bit muddy.  The regular iced coffee is totally adequate, but nothing special.  Iced mochas need sugar but are pretty yummy once that has been taken care of.  The Thai Iced coffee is truly where they shine.  It's so yummy, refreshing, totally addictive, and will get you amped for anything.

Negative reviews are important to write, but I miss having good things to say.  Luckily, I'm spending a little quiet time in Philadelphia this week, and I seem to have hit the jackpot with Rocket Cat Cafe.  Warm, generous, open, hip space.  Coffee and food are very good.  Free wireless and plug-in's but, as with Leotah's, not at all coldly laptopp-y in feel.  And like Leotah's, this place has a beautifully alternative feel that seems to be far too short in supply in Philadelphia.  Although Rocket Cat is a genuine cafe in the sense of it's being expected that many people will simply come here for coffee and writing/surfing, the owner (or proprietor?) seems to take a kind of quiet joy in customizing items as casual as a bagel-with-avocado, or a simple sandwich, to the appetite of the eater.  More than that, she seems to have a sense of how to add small touches that make a dish great.  For example, she asked if I wanted olive oil on my avocado bagel, and this addition made the bagel totally delicious (obvious, I guess, but honestly I never thought of it).  It was just a bagel with avocado!  But she made it great.  There's also a retro wrap-around counter area with stools, and the fact that these seats are pretty regularly used seems to be a testament to the warm, kind feel of this place.

I was at a table with my friend and I got up to get a refill on my Tea. When I came back to sit down, I put the tea on my table then sat in the chair, and it suddenly went backwards and stopped at an angle. I thought at first that I had broken my chair, and tried to get up when I realized I was stuck at an odd angle. As a bigger person, I was at first extremely embarrassed about the situation, though honestly i've NEVER broken a chair before in my life! When I looked down I saw that the leg of my chair had fallen into a HOLE in the floor. Not the side of the floor against the wall, the side of my chair in the middle of the floor! It took  another patron to help get me up. The other patron said to me that the same thing had happened to him recently. I got up and informed the two young ladies at the bar about what happened, and I got the brush off with them saying \"Oh no! We will look into that\" then turning away from me.  What would have happened if I had not put my tea down before? I could have been severely burnt! Right away I started having some back pain which has gotten worse since I left. I also now have a headache. I tried to find an e-mail address for the owner but I couldn't. I will be going to the doctor on monday to get my back checked out.\n\nI think the worst part of this embarrassing experience is that the people behind the bar didn't even do so much as to ask if I was ok? And I wasn't sitting in an out of the way table. That hole is dangerous. I also noticed one around the pipes on the other side of my table. I will continue to try and contact the owner of the shop. \n\nThis was not my first time at Rocket Cat, and before this I have enjoyed it. The food is good, the people are usually friendly, and their tea doesn't suck which is a rarity in this area. I won't be going back though, because of the attitude of the baristas.

Going to NoLibs wasn't an option since I needed to try something new. But that proved to be more difficult than I anticipated since Canvas Coffee Co. which was closest looked to be closed for good. Hot Potato Cafe teased me by being closed so they could load musical equipment into their space (and apparently teased me even further by not being a coffeehouse). As soon as I found it I was tempted to enter Sulimay's so I could give it a minimum of 3 smurf dances (thanks Ben - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myUN_ES8Hw) but it just wasn't what I was looking for. \n\nFinally I called up friend who was able to point me in the direction of Rocket Cat just in time because I was seriously craving a cup! my first reaction was that the bike toting hipster vibe was very strong within it, but they were equally friendly with me (even if I was a sweating zombie by the time I got there.). The large coffee was a humongous and came at a decent price. And although the veggie platters looked mighty tempting I decided to go with a cookie that was the size of my fist. not only was it that large, but it had nuts, chocolate chips, and ginger inside of it.

Firstly, our server never came to greet us, and when the hostess walked by, she noticed and sent her over. Once there, she informed us no one told her we were her table.  Next, we ordered the Acai Bowl, which is mostly banana whip.  I have worked in restaurants that served whip, have a whip machine at home, and had this dish there in the past so I know there was absolutely no banana in it. When the server asked us how it was, I politely told her there was no banana.  She said she would check with the kitchen and when she returned, told us there was indeed banana in it.  But then, a bus boy came to our table and told us the \"recipe changed\" (even though it is the same on the menu) after hearing our conversation. But finally, we overheard another server at the table right next to us tell that couple to be aware that the caf\u00e9 has been out of bananas and could not make smoothies, etc. Wow!  We could not believe we were lied to.  And we were still charged for it!\n\nIt just got worse.  We waited a long time for our food, and when it finally came out, it was not what we ordered.  We waited some time again, and a second round of dishes came out  - not our food. We could not believe it (neither could the table next to us).  When we finally got our food, over an hour later, it was cold as if it was just sitting in the kitchen.

The variety of offerings from one venue with hours that practically make it a 24-hour operation should yield a review of much more praise...unfortunately it falls flat. There's a lot that Front Street Cafe can be and should be doing to really make this an all-star neighborhood contender. Here's the breakdown of woo's and boo's:\n\nCAFE: \nWoo!: I'll start here because I have great things to say about the coffee shop aspect of FSC. The house coffee is Counter Culture Hologram, a delicious cup for a very reasonable $1.75 a cup (though strangely I was charged $2.50 when ordering off of the brunch menu). The pastry case is stocked with local favorites such as Dottie's Donuts and Crust Vegan Bakery, so good that my carnivorous boyfriend was shocked when he ordered a donut only to later learn that it was vegan. The grab-and-go case has a variety of offerings including juices and pre-made salads/sandwiches, definitely a nice option to have when on the run.\nBoo!: The entire FSC space is kind of just a mish-mash of usable serviceable table space, upstairs, downstairs, cafe, patio, you can sit wherever. I come here often to do work, mostly on weeknights before I go home, and I can choose to sit wherever there is an open table to set up shop and grab a cup of coffee. On weekends, however, top priority is given to someone ordering a full meal. I understand the loss of money on a table that is only ordering coffee and looking to knock out an hour or two worth of work, but being turned away doesn't make the space feel much like a comfy neighborhood cafe anymore. On my most recent visit, I asked if there was anywhere that I could get a little bit of work done and I was told no because the cafe is used for brunch from 10:00-2:00...when I told the hostess that I had every intention of ordering a meal, I was immediately given a table. Many others were turned away from sitting and having a casual cup of coffee because the entire cafe side of the house was being used to seat brunch-goers. \n\nFOOD: \nWoo!: While I haven't had a full dinner here, I have ordered happy hour appetizers and have had brunch on more than one occasion. For happy hour, follow the recommendation of many other reviewers and order the buffalo cauliflower, it really is delicious. Other notables for me have been the oven fried potato and the pickled veggie platter, but I'm a sucker for anything soaked in vinegar. \nBoo!: When every other negative review says that their food was cold upon arrival, you would think FSC would take note. The first time I had brunch, I ordered a salad so I couldn't speak to food temperature; on my most recent visit however, I ordered the Gravlax platter (again opting for a cold dish)...how can you mess up a cold salmon platter? Easy. You send the dish out missing the avocado listed on the menu, you inconsistently slice the salmon, and you fry the capers in what tasted to be old oil. I'll generously offer a redeeming plus one for the everything english muffin, it's about as close to a bagel as you get on their menu....I'm still confused as to why a cafe doesn't have bagels that aren't gluten free. Lastly, I wouldn't normally comment on someone else's experience, but sitting next to me was a couple whose food came out so cold that one of the two told the server that it felt like his eggs benedict had been placed in the refrigerator prior to serving. Now that's pretty bad. \n\nTHE BAR: \nWoo!: It's a bar!\nBoo!: When Front Street Cafe first opened, they had a killer happy hour. Their specialty cocktails were half priced, and select beers and wine (3 beers, 1 white wine, 1 red wine) were all $5 plus a half priced juice of the day from the cafe. I told a group of friends all about it and so we decided on this as our Friday end-of-week wind down happy hour opting to sit outside on the gorgeous patio. Sitting here meant that we had table service, which would have been fine except that our waiter didn't write down any of our orders and ended up bringing us incorrect cocktails on both rounds before we called it quits and went elsewhere. Luckily we aren't too picky, we found someone at the table who would drink what was brought out, but between the inaccurate orders and the understaffed bar, happy hour consisted of two rounds over two hours because service was just so slow. Not long after FSC opened, that happy hour disappeared. While happy hour still exists, the options are much more limited in nature; while this may mean a more manageable list for the bar and waitstaff, it's a little disappointing for patrons who may not care for the single $5 cocktail on the menu.\n\nWith a few fixes I can see FSC really knocking it out of the park, but until that happens I'll be here during off-peak hours for coffee and taking happy hour/brunch to other businesses in the neighborhood.", "date": "2016-02-08 19:22:33", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 388, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2010-03-22 18:25:01"}}

The chicken and waffle bites came out 5 minutes later so I'm assuming maybe the kitchen was off and the server was waiting for the entire order and our Platters were left out to dry. \n\nA new order was made which we appreciated, I feel we were extremely understanding and polite when we mentioned it was cold, we just wanted to get our money's worth and to experience quality since it's slightly heftier than your typical breakfast pricing..and at a diner usually things come out so hot you have to wait a minute. \n\nThe poached eggs, hash and fries were being remade as we picked at our chicken and waffle bites, that were slightly undercooked.... maybe not but we were unable to make it through a few because they were tough and hard to chew.

I would have rather waited longer a second time for the food to taste right than to have instant gratification. I'm a patient person ( this experience tested that for sure) and on top of it all it lacked flavor ... no fabrication, it was extremely undercooked and had no flavor.  The fries were forgotten about until 10 minutes before we asked for our check, with the 3 aioli just chilling there at 50cents a pop, which I totally wouldn't have minded if I actually had fries to dip into them. \n\nLike I said, I work in the industry. From the way it seemed, the server was spread thin and tried her best,may have not only been encountering issues with only our party.

A restaurant/cafe/bar/performance space seems like a recipe for disaster, but thoughtful attention to the customer experience down to small details make this place a winner. Some things I appreciated when my husband and I visited for brunch yesterday:\n\n* It can take a while to get seated, but there's a coffee bar right there where you can order yummy drinks and smoothies while you wait. There's also some seating, which in our case was taken up by families, but is a nice touch. \n\n* They have a new fancy water filtration system that they seem super proud of. We were informed up front that it would be an additional $1 per person for unlimited fancy filtered water and decided to go for it. The water was tasty, and I like that they are serving healthy options that don't trash the environment. \n\n* The main dining area is a big, open, high-ceilinged space with hardwood floors, brick walls, metal ceilings, and lots of iron. Spaces like this always look beautiful, except that they're usually so loud you can't hear yourself think. Front Street Cafe remedied this by lining the edges of the ceiling with unobtrusive sound-insulating panels that matched the corrugated metal ceiling, keeping the aesthetic but making it easy to have a conversation. The music was also the exact right volume. It's such a small thing, but it makes such a big difference. \n\n* The menu was incredibly vegan-friendly but still had options for die-hard carnivores (like my husband). A place where your vegan friends and your husband who will die without red meat can dine harmoniously? Yes, please. \n\n* The pancakes were delicious, and were heaped with sculptural levels of fresh fruit, almond cream, granola, and real maple syrup. I don't know what that other lady is going on about. Maybe next time she should just go to IHOP. \n\n* Nice beer list and drinks menu. We didn't partake (it was brunch, and we had to drive), but good to know for next time. \n\n* Every staff member we interacted with was lovely. Personable without being smarmy, accommodating without hovering. We shared some laughs. It was nice. \n\n* The bathrooms are spacious and have many stalls.

Interior and massive outdoors patio is what dream eateries are made of.  Cool, clean, with a little industrial, a little farmhouse. There is so much room, you feel like you can breathe, stretch out and enjoy your meal, cocktails, what have you. And folks, that's where my compliments will end. The burger was pretty good, but dang, this place needs WORK. It's been a while since I've experienced such horrendous service like what's going on here.\n\nWhat absolutely ruined my experience the last time I was here, was a combined failure of front and back of house, and one where not one management person came to our table to apologize or explain, which is a big no-no in my book. Let me reiterate that prior to my current employment, I had been in the restaurant/service industry for a long time, so I'm familiar how problems like these typically get resolved.  \n\nSet scene.  Sunday brunch. Mid-day, relatively busy, but not oppressively so. Lots of vacant tables, restaurant seemed to be well-staffed. Party of five (that includes a three year old).\nOrders taken for drinks and food at the same time. Takes a good fifteen minutes to receive drink order.  Fine, it's brunch.  Food arrives perhaps another fifteen minutes later, but food runner brings me a wrong order, and the two sides we ordered for my daughter never materialize or the iced coffee that I had ordered at the outset.  \n\nTen minutes pass, our server absent-minded appears with no apology but says food is coming, I remind her of the missing sides (a bagel and some grits) along with my order: a vegetable sandwich. Easy peasy. I'm polite. Bagel and a veggie sandwich, kitchen should be able to slap that together rather fast? No. \n\n Another ten to fifteen minutes pass and nothing. Finally the bagel for my daughter appears, few minutes later, the iced coffee is dropped off. I urge everyone to eat while it's hot, and no one really steps forward to tell us the status of the outstanding food, or apologizes - it's just an afterthought. After everyone is done, the server re-appears again without showing interest or concern.  I inform her that I'd like to take my food to go since the meal is finished. Nearly twenty minutes after everyone's food arrives, my to go container with a VEGETABLE sandwich (not a burger well done) appears. Our bill arrives and she tells us she didn't charge us for the sides (well, the one bagel we ordered) nor the sandwich and that's it.  No apology, no manager, no one. Crickets.\n\nThe food in the end, is pretty much mediocre and on the whole cold.  The burger is the most delicious item I taste at the table (and I'd reorder that in a heartbeat, if I ever was to return), and their bloody mary's, are well, absymal.  The veggie sandwich I eat once we're home, it simply that: a sad little bun that contains peppers, onions, a portabella mushroom and a couple strands of arugula. I'm told there's some salsa verde in there, but I don't taste it. Their smoothies (though crazy price-y at 8 bucks a pop) are yummy.  We were seated at the large booths that sit right at the double doors that lead outside; which annoyingly enough felt the harsh reverberations of the doors smashing open and shut every 45 seconds when service kept going in and out.\n\nThe absolute lack in professional service and/or concern was the real kicker for me here. I mean, mistakes happen.  This restaurant hasn't been open forever, but it's been long enough, that these kinds of mistakes and inconsistencies should be resolved by now, and the fact that the manager (I'm assuming it was a woman that delivered the bagel and said it was 'on her' - and who never introduced herself or made a reappearance at our table - clearly avoiding us) was entirely absent really ruined the whole dining experience for both myself and my family who was dining here for the first time.  The server could have barely given a shit, either that, or she was a very good actress. A \"I'm sorry about the mistake or your order, or anything\" would have been nice. But nope. Entirely unacceptable.

I am not a vegan, but lactose intolerant and have a difficult time with bread (not gluten free, just can't do a lot of bread). Let me start by saying that I had a really difficult time picking only one thing...so I didn't! Here is what I got:\n\n1. Porridge: Oh....My.....Lord was this good. This bowl (gluten free and vegan btw) is so large and full of all of the good things your body needs. You have plant-based milk, coconut, nuts, fruits, and just general deliciousness. Not to mention that the portion is HUGE! I took like 60% of it home and had it for breakfast this morning (still good). \n\n2. Vegan Scrapple: I've had better but it wasn't the worst. Doesn't taste like scrapple, though. \n\n3. Mushroom Bacon: I'm telling you right now that I will have dirty dreams about this \"bacon\". As a meat eater, this bacon (while it doesn't taste 100% like bacon) is the work of a genius. How on earth did you get mushrooms to taste like that? If you don't get the bacon, you're a fool. Try it! A side is just $4! Even my mate, who got actual bacon, was surprised at how good it was. Do. It. \n\n4. My mate got the eggs benedict with bacon on an everything english muffin. The muffin was not your typical Thomas', but looked good. The bacon was exceptionally done, nice a crispy. However, the hollandaise looked a little TOO yellow for my fancy and...to the detriment of those like myself who love to watch a poached egg explode...the second one was cooked all the way through like a hard boiled egg. Oh well, it happens. Poaching is an art. \n\nFor drinks, I got a cortada which was good and my  mate got a coffee which was way too bitter for my taste. He also got a Mimosa that was way overpriced but \"it's okay, it's mainly champagne\" he assured me. I got a glass of wine to finish off my meal that was a-okay in my book. \n\nWill I be back?

The upstairs is significantly smaller than downstairs but it was very quiet and there were lots of people up there studying and working, so it seemed like the right place for us to be. I want to open my review by saying that I really love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Like many restaurants in Northern Liberties and Fishtown, it definitely has a sort of weathered, industrial, antiquated feel to it, and I really love that aesthetic so I thought it was charming.\n\nOur server greeted us with coffee and was very attentive. The coffee was served in these delightfully large mugs that were perfect for wrapping your hands around on a freezing cold day. I'm not an expert coffee taster by any means, but I thought that the coffee was a little too bitter even after adding sugar and cream.\n\nWe ordered buffalo and sriracha cauliflower, which unfortunately was not served until just before our entrees came out. The cauliflower itself was awesome, I am certainly not a big eater of this particular vegetable but I thought that our appetizers were really great and I would order them again. Besides being really flavorful, the cauliflower also had a nice texture, as though it were baked or fried. \n\nFor my entree I ordered huevos rancheros. I was honestly a little bit disappointed, I thought it was a little bit small considering it was $14. It was served on a large plate and had a significant amount of fresh greens on top so it looked like a salad at first glance. Underneath the greens were the black beans, eggs, tortilla, quinoa, and other fixings. I didn't feel like the greens added anything amazing to the flavor of the meal. The entree itself was good, but felt light and didn't leave me feeling satisfied. If I go back I think I will order something different. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the restaurant and I would definitely like to eat here again.\n\nMy final breakdown: \nService: 5 out of 5\nAtmosphere: 5 out of 5\nFood: 3.5 out of 5\nParking: free, if you can find it", "date": "2018-01-03 23:20:11", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 70, "average_stars": 4.32, "yelping_since": "2014-08-09 23:50:49"}}

Immediately, we loved the ambiance of the place - so clean/modern, but cozy and inviting at the same time. Unfortunately, there wasn't much else that impressed us about Front Street Cafe.\n\nFirst, they don't have a dedicated happy hour menu, although they do offer specials. There was no mention of happy hour anywhere, and our waitress never brought it up - we only knew from having visited the Facebook page prior to our visit. Even after we specifically asked about it, it took a while for us to figure out what the offerings were. One of us opted for the cucumber gimlet, and two of us got the only red wine that was included in happy hour - the Cotes du Rhone.\n\nThe good: the cucumber gimlet was delicious. The very bad: our red wine tasted straight-up rotten. This wasn't just a bitter or poorly-made wine - I've had the displeasure of accidentally ingesting rotten grapes (or rotten food in general), and the three of us all agreed that that was pretty much what this wine tasted like.\n\nI brought up the matter to our waitress (note that I'm generally not picky at all about food, and never fuss unless there's an actual problem). She insisted that they got this complaint \"all the time\" and that it was just the way that the wine was - \"earthy\" and \"vinegary.\" She didn't offer to taste it herself or get a second opinion, but immediately dismissed our complaint. Thankfully, she was able to take the wine off the tab, so we just left it at that.\n\nThe dinner entrees were better. My friend was satisfied with her veggie burger (quinoa + mushroom) and I enjoyed my fried chicken sandwich, although our party seemed to agree that the banh mi was rather mediocre. The oven fried potato that is offered with the sandwiches may have been my favorite part of the meal - it's a wonderful cross between a baked potato and potato chips/fries.\n\nI wasn't sure what to make of the service. It was a little on the slow side, although we weren't there during a particularly busy time. Our waitress answered all of our questions and was reasonably nice, but I'm still bothered by her response to our wine.\n\nOverall, I'd give the food 3.5* and service 2.5*. (I've decided to give FSC the benefit of the doubt and not take the potentially rotten wine into consideration.) Decent, but it's not good enough to make the trek from Center City/West Philly worth it.", "date": "2015-11-18 04:08:05", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 33, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2015-04-12 22:17:22"}}

I've been clamoring to try it and was so excited that we finally had a Saturday available for brunch. \n\nFirst, it's gorgeous. They took their time with this place and it shows. I'd go back just for the building. I definitely want to sit in the garden and have coffee drinks, and cocktails, and dinner. But for now the main vibe I got from the place was coldness. It was a recurring theme.\n\nOur server was disinterested and barely spoke with us except to take our order. She checked on us once the whole time. I got a hot tea and never received any sweetener and had to ask for lemon with it (from the women who delivered it). Odd. In general it seemed like we were bothering her. We sat upstairs with I think one or two other tables. Our food was also cold or room temperature. Huh? It felt like a lot of the components were premade and then assembled by the kitchen staff. My husband ordered the vegan biscuits and gravy with real poached eggs and a side of mushroom bacon. I had the tofu scramble benedict with vegan scrapple.  My dish was room temperature. The food tasted really good (save for the baked products that were dense and need some serious work). I loved my tofu scramble, hollandaise, and and vegan scrapple. The flavors were great, but served hot with a lighter muffin would've been perfection. His dish was tasty, but again the only egg was hot and it seemed the rest of the dish was reheated. The mushroom gravy was a little scarce, but delicious. The biscuit was better than my english muffin, but still pretty dense. Even the mushroom bacon was cold, and needed a little salt. It's like the smoked coconut bacon from Memphis Taproom but a little sweeter and the texture is chewier. We left full, but I think that was only because of the dense baked goods. \n\nBecause they are so vegan and vegetarian friendly, I will definitely go back. I appreciate a business that takes the time to create an interesting and flavorful menu, but something about it seemed rush. I feel like with refinement (and a nicer server) this place could easily be five stars. Yes, it's kind of crazy expensive, including the draft list. Really? No. Not in Fishtown where you can go to so many different craft beer bars and get drafts $2-3 cheaper.

Really comforting, especially when coming in from the cold outside. As soon as you step in, you're greeted by a large lobby and bar that serves tea, coffee, and smoothies. We got teas while we waited which were fitting for the cold weather (green jade blossom).\n\nWhen being seated, the area is quite small but packed. There's a homey feel to it as everyone is happy and talking away with their friends/family.\n\nWe ordered the turkey burger and all natural burger since we craved lunch food instead of breakfast food. \n\nYou'd think that the burgers are just burgers but honestly, they were one of the best burgers I've had.\n\nThe turkey burger tasted nothing like turkey since it was so moist. I'd say it was more of a turkey patty with the texture of a breakfast sausage. Nice and spongy but without the grease! With the avocado and plentiful fries, it made a nice pairing that left you full but not sluggish (you know, the feeling after having a greasy meal).\n\nThe all natural burger was the no frills all american burger that came with bacon. I ordered it in a medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. This resulted in a nice and juicy patty that sent me to heaven whenever I took a bite. Beware though, it was extremely messy and I found my hands covered in grease/juice that made me wish I picked something else (but that's just me!). Regardless, it was an amazing burger and I'd go back just to order 2 or 3 more. \n\nI mentioned the fries briefly but I didn't mention they tied up the meal. Some fries are sad and soggy. Some are crunchy and stiff. These fries were right in the middle. This led to a nice soft interior but extremely crunchy exterior that created a party in your mouth whenever you had them after a bite of your burger.\n\nObviously, we could have gotten something different but it was 2pm by the time we got there and we were so hungry that we picked basically anything that we immediately saw.", "date": "2018-11-13 04:04:37", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 17, "average_stars": 4.47, "yelping_since": "2012-08-11 03:11:03"}}

Actually, it's my least favorite dining experience of all time!!! My car got towed (illegally come to find out) on Front Street, in front of Kung Fu Necktie across the street. Be VERY careful parking around here as the area is known for vicious tow truck companies just running away with your car! Well, one company really. A truly traumatic experience. I mean, awful!! AWFUL!! Threatened with pit-bulls, dead bolted in a room full of men in an scary neighborhood, scammed out of my money, lied to....Horrific!!! See my review for Siani's Salvage. You were warned!! I don't want to fog what will be a shining review with this negativity so I'll just leave it at that. It's truly a shame this experience has made me hesitant to return as the food and vibes were just my style....\n\nLet's start with the ambiance which is truly great. Reclaimed wood, exposed brick, clean, bright and light, industrial chic. There's also a roof deck and courtyard which look phenomenal and I place I wood like to be in warmer weather. The flowers on the table were simple but had a little sparkle. Love that! \n\nWe entered and moved past all of the people grabbing their morning coffees and nosh to the hostess stand. It seems like this place is a morning rush go-to for those who live nearby. I can certainly see why. I happened to catch a glimpse of the bakery case which looks filled with  delicious goods and did notice the variety of milks...soy, almond...oh yea, I'm in the right place. Excited! \n\nWe waited about 8 minutes on a holiday Monday morning until we were seated, but not before we were asked if we had reservations (even though there were plenty of empty tables) so I'm assuming they are usually needed for brunch (?). \n\nWe were escorted to the back room by the beautiful bar and the hostess handed my daughter crayons and a nice big coloring sheet so yea, go ahead and bring those kiddos! \n\nWe started with the Matcha Mint Chip smoothie \n(cacao, mint, matcha, almond maple, banana, vanilla) which I thought was really great! Not too thick and full of\nMinty flavor! I would definitely get it again. $8 is fairly standard for this type of drink. \n\nOur table of 4 split: \n\nThe Acai Bowl- (acai banana whip, coconut, fresh seasonal fruits, nuts and seeds granola $10.) Very good.  A tad too \"soupy\" for me personally, but the table liked it a lot and it was tasty!\n\nThose iconic Lean Green Hotcakes- (fresh seasonal fruits, vanilla cashew cream, maple syrup $12.) They told me the color is created by using kale juice! How clever!! They were good. The toppings were better than the actual cakes. Needed the syrup, a tad on the dry side. Would maybe give it another go. \n\nThe tofu tacos: (tofu scramble, kale, avocado, smoked mushrooms, ``whiz``, pickled red onions, micro cilantro, corn tortillas, smoked black beans $12) DELISH!! Love the pickled red onions. Perfectly sized portion! Loved these!! A great brunch item!\n\nThe chili: (hearty lentil chili, gluten-free cornbread muffin $7.) Very tasty, filling and just the right amount of spice. Perfect for a cool day. \n\nKale Caesar: (kale, walnut picada, roasted tomatoes, pickled red onions, cucumber, roasted tomato vinaigrette $10) My favorite dish of the day!! Again with those pickled red onions!! Yum! Perfect blackened tofu. Perfect dressing to kale ratio. Perfect!! Get one for the table to share!\n\nPrices were very fair for the quality and portion sizes. \n\nI was very impressed by the creative, eclectic menu!! You do not have to be vegan to enjoy a meal here (they have a few options for you carnivores), but boy if you are....it's paradise!! Go for it! I wanted to sample everything and really wish to come back and do so as it all looks incredible. So many amazing options!!

Very roomy and the outdoor garden is very beautiful on this 70 degree day for brunch. \n\nService: (3.5/5) I went today (4/21/2019) for Sunday Brunch with a party of 5, my GF's cousin put her name down with the hostesses (there were two of them, a male and female) and we waited. As 20 minutes went by, she went back to check and the hostess got a little hasty and just tossed the mini-clipboard menus down as if we were in the wrong when she sat us down at our table.

The drinks and food came out in a timely manner. \n\nFood: (2.5/3/5) I am NOT an expert at food rating nor am I foodie by any stretch of the means, but as I got a taste of the dishes my friends ordered, the food is pretty bland and need a little bit of seasoning. *Again, I am not an expert on judging food and this is my FIRST time here but have been to other cafes where I can respectfully compare to Front Street's Food.* Three of my friends ordered Egg's Benedict, w/a side of potatoes and the bread seemed kind of over-toasted a little bit but the rest of the components were okay. The potatoes were a bit bland. As for myself, I had the Quinoa Bean Bowl Salad (w/no add-ons) and it was pretty good as the salad that topped the tortilla was excellent and well dressed and the Quinoa bean salad's texture is thick enough to use as dip. \n\nDrinks: Acai Smoothie-Great, Iced Wild Berry Hibiscus Tea-Great, Peach Blossom Tea-Great, Iced Coffee-Bad, Cortado-Good. The iced coffee was a bit water down (mind you that my friend took a sip of the coffee before the ice melted). \n\nAt the end of the experience, we did not come out too satisfied with our food as the hostess kind of put a sour beginning to our experience and the food came out pretty bland. I understand that it is Easter Sunday, it is busy but a little more effort into the food could be improved a little bit. I am not going to be harsh in saying I will never revisit, but I think Cafe Lift has this place beat by a little.

I'm vegan and brought my friend who is extremely allergic to dairy to try French Onion Soup for the first time in her life and she was so excited.

Next thing we knew the manager came over with a prepared monologue about how much they respect the vegan diet and how they would never intentionally cause someone to break their moral stance on not eating animals. It was at this point we had to ask \"so what you're saying is that this is in fact real cheese?\" Which she only then actually confirmed. When I informed the manager that my friend in fact was having a severe allergic reaction she shut down and all she did was ask if there was anything else she could do. We asked for Benadryl which they didn't have so we asked for directions to the closes gas station as a member of our party ran to the gas station. Meanwhile, the server game over and bragged that she definitely put in vegan and fully blamed the cook rather than acknowledging that she had any part in the matter. She didn't ask how my friend was or check to make sure she was ok (no one did). All she did was comp her $7 soup from our $100 ticket as if that absolved her of any wrongdoing.

He said no and also explained that allowing me to stand at the cafe counter closer to the window--would be \"loitering\"\n\nwhile I was waiting for my latte I spoke briefly with the manager and explained that I understood policies and that they were meant to be malleable and that this particular one was short sighted when it came to business.\n\nThe optic is not good --especially when you have tons of empty tables, and 20 people standing around chatting  (there were honestly more servers congregating in the station than there were in the entire place.)\n\nThe vibe , the energy, the slight condecension I got from the manager--he would I\"m sure deny it--but the energy was just off kilter in here.  \n\nI always believe that flows from the top down.\n\nI just think it's really shitty and bad business for a neighborhood establishment--to not think outside the box and say, \"yeah, you know what, we don't make a habit of it--but given there are two people in the place and 10 servers standing around (he actually told me it was because they needed to disinfect the table after--um, cuz you don't have enough people here to do it?)\n\nReally short sighted, really bad business, and doesn't exactly the kind of vibe that makes you want to patronize their establishment.  \n\nThink outside the proverbial box when it comes to creating \"policy.\" \nThey are there as guidelines and meant to protect everyone--not to be put in place just because youre being a stickler and cutting off your nose to spite your face.

He was very attentive but patient with us (even though it took us quite some time to make up our minds and place our other!).\n\nI went with the All-Natural Chicken Sandwich no pickles, add avocado, and a side of fries. Would've have gotten a perfect 10/10 if not for just two small things: the fries being too salty and the cook forgetting to remove the pickles. Still 8/10 is pretty solid! My sandwich was juicy, fulfilling, and surprisingly delicious given that it was not a the typical big deep fried super breaded chicken breast style. Adding the avocado did cost a bit much ($3.50 extra) but it was worth it, that touch of avocado was *chefs kiss*. The fries were made almost too perfection but they were a bit too generous with the salt.\n\nMy cousin got the Griddled Cheese with a side of Fries and she was very much satisfied with zero complaints. I did take a bite of her sandwich and I almost wish that I would have went with that option. It was a bit too cheesy for me but the jalapeno-tomato jam was to die for. The slight sweetness complimented the cheese so well so if you are looking for a not so basic grilled cheese I wholeheartedly recommend this! Her fries were also a bit on the salty side too but not even one was left on our plates.\n\nWe did not get any drinks besides water so I cannot make any comments/suggestions on any..(water was good but that's hard to mess up)\n\nOverall, FSC had exceptional service, superb ambiance, and conventional dishes with delicious original twists!

There is a coffee bar with fresh pastries and smoothies. There's an outside terrace area with plenty of seating. The restaurant area has a bar that you can sit at. The morning cocktails look declines.  \n\nThere was a fifteen minute wait. There was plenty of open seating but there were only 3 servers and they were staggering the tables.

We were seated and we only took a few minutes to look at the menu and ordered right away because we were starving. \n\nI ordered the Huevos rancheros and my dad got the peaches and cream pancakes with a side of the veggies hash. While we were ordering, the table next to us ordered and we were almost drooling, the food looked that good. That persuaded my dad to get a side of the veggie hash. Our tables was close to the kitchen and I was able to see the food being prepared and ready to be served. The french toast is so incredibly thick, the burger and chicken were giant and the salads looked so fresh. Nothing sits for long which is a sign of fresh food. \n\nOur food came out and it tasted as good as it looks. The Huevos rancheros was u like anything I've had before. It had a quinoa, rice and black bean mix on the bottom, topped with 2 sunny side eggs on a tortilla and then topped with fresh greens. There was some sort of spicy sauce on the side too. It was so flavorful and fresh. \n\nI tried the veggie hash which was delicious. But oh my, those pancakes! We looked at the menu ahead of time and were hoping for the banana pancakes but the actual menu there only had peaches and cream. Anyways, those are some of the best pancakes I've ever had.

Latte Lounge, the owner-operated coffee shop that used to occupy the space was down-home beautiful, a place where neighbors would meet and greet and live jazz performances were sometimes held. It had a lot of soul, which helped me overlook just how run down it was.  When it closed a few years ago after a nearly 10 year run, I and the fam were disappointed. It wasn't perfect, but it was a place to grab a coffee, gab with the owner and a neighbor or two, and maybe read to my little girl from the generous collection of donated childrens' books.  But Cafe Maude not only brought back the sense of family that we missed, they brought a level of excellence and professionalism to the business that is very much a rarity in these parts. The space was completely gutted, the basement excavated, and a sophisticated Parisian-modern establishment cleverly shoe-horned into a modest row-home ground floor. A spectacular transformation. The owners had a lot of input in the design, but utilized a professional designer (Robin Stellwagen) to guide the planning and design process. This was a wise move, and shows in the attention to the layout, use of materials and simple but important details, like the cleanable surface on the condiment counter. As a hospitality designer I may be biased, but I have seen so many costly mistakes on DIY projects that It has become a pet peeve of mine. \n\nIn spite of the few negative reviews about service on this blog, which I am really surprised to read, I would say that Cafe Maude's service is their strong suit. Quick and professional, and completely attentive to the customer. Very little if any barista sidetalk going on here. It is all about the customer enjoying their experience, whether it is a delicious latte with a French pastry, or a fresh omelette and salad. But I DO have to agree with a few negative reviewers who were upset with the service packs of butter and cream cheese offered. Nothing says inauthentic more than this. Take a second to apply the condiment and know your customer's preference (schmear? loaded? touch of butter?) and you will have won over your customer. I hope the owners toss out the service pack concept, which is especially jarring given how wonderful the place is otherwise.\n\nI appreciate that Cafe Maude has a depth of staff including a charming bus person to bring food up from the kitchen and clear tables, although the owner is just as likely to do this. It also helps that they usually have more than one person behind the counter when it gets busy; a register person AND a barista. \n\nMy colleague Zaid who is from the Middle East, loves this place and finds the dishes delicious and authentic. He not only enjoyed his lunch, but got to speak his native Arabic with the charming owner, Natalie. The design is clean and tasteful, and I am especially impressed with the a la carte kitchen and Parisian style bathroom they have carved out of the basement. Clearly the owners take great pride in their establishment and have invested a great deal of treasure in the building AND the business.

Everything on the menu looked delicious and we couldn't decide. Our waitresses was very knowledgeable and helped us picked some awesome dishes. \n\nWe got the sweet potato benny and petit steak breakfast with a side of applewood bacon and French fries. We also ordered vanilla chai latte and the berrylicious French toast for the dessert.\n\nIf I could only use one word to describe our food, it would be \"beautiful\". I did not expect art on a plate for breakfast when I came here. The colors and presentation was very clean and appetizing. My sweet potato Benny plate was very good. One of my poached eggs was over cooked but everything else was simply delicious. I love that the hash were made from sweet potatoes, they added a sweet contrast to the savory Lebanese sausage. \n\nThe petit steak breakfast had similar elements to my dish but tasted even better. The steaks were tender and perfectly seasoned. I really appreciated the fact that their hash came with mango chunks. They really nailed the balance of flavors here, sweet and savory. The French fries were very crunchy, just the way I like them. The Apple wood bacon was crisp throughout the meal. This place really knew how to elevate simple ingredients!\n\nMy vanilla chai latte was one of the best I've had and again, the presentation was just beautiful. My favorite dish however, was dessert.

After reading about the infamous wait times at Caf\u00e9 La Maude, my sister and I arrived early to put our name in for a table. We were surprised when we were called to be seated after only a few minutes. The problem? On their way to the restaurant, my parents decided to take a leisurely, untimely, and unannounced tour of Spring Garden Street. Realizing they were going to be tardy for our party, I made the hospitable hostess aware of our predicament. The hostess, Andrea, was incredibly understanding; she allowed us to keep our place in line AND graciously worked to seat us immediately when my parents showed up (un)fashionably late. A big shout-out to Andrea--Lebron needs a lesson from you, girl, because you're the real MVP. \n\nJust when we thought our experience couldn't get better, we met our server Jonathan. Have you ever been referred to as a magical unicorn when you're stuffing your face like a barnyard animal? Thanks to Jonathan, I have--and it made me feel like a mix of Fergie and Jesus. Jonathan delighted my family so much I'm sure they're somewhere drafting adoption papers #StayGoldenPonyboy From the owner to the servers, every single person working in this restaurant is a gem.

Not saying there was no wait at all, but with a super small dining area, there were really no more than a handful of people waiting at any one time during prime brunch hours on Sunday morning.\n\nThe walls have adorable wallpaper accented with a black chair rail and ornately framed paintings of the owners dog (who, I am told, is frequently present in the cafe). There are little high top black tables, small marble tiles on the floor, and sweet French-countryside-esque banquets holding coffee accoutrements, water pitchers, and the sweet handmade, eclectic coffee mugs which serve your perfectly brewed La Colombe roast.\n\nOn one end of the bar, logically, the end facing the large glass windows overlooking 4th St, you'll find homemade pastries and cookies in little glass domes: shortbread cookies, baklava, rugelach, and something chocolate that I probably should've bought so I could figure out what it was. They don't make the croissants in house, but it doesn't really matter--they are perfect. \n\nThe couple that owns this place is there waiting on you hand and foot. They are kind, attentive, and make you feel like family. They'll stop by frequently enough that you are never left needing anything. Also, they are super kind to their regulars. \n\nWhen you sit, you are handed a small clipboard with the daily specials, which includes about 6-8 different plates. This is in addition to the very expansive French-Mediterranean choices that are regulars, written on the mirrored board above the bar. The options, as mentioned, are a good mix of classic French food with some Mediterranean flavors thrown in for good measure. I am told the food is French-Lebanese. I had an open faced sandwich called the \"N-Liberties,\" two english muffins topped with hummus, avocado, fried jalapenos, caramelized onions, crumbled sausage, all topped with a fried egg. Oh and with potato pancakes on the side as well. It was absolutely to die for. My dining partners finished most every bite on their plate--a croque madame made to order with scrambled eggs instead of over easy (they will accommodate every request), and a Mediterranean open faced burrito the size of my face.\n\nI love this place.

Actually, I wanna quit working normal day hours so that I can become a regular and just chill out with a perfect coffee, and a perfect pastry while doing whatever it is people do while sitting all day in coffee shops.

After some serious carb indiscretions on my vacay, I needed to get back into keto ASAP so my selection was narrowed and thank god because I'm both extremely indecisive and I also have limited attention span when it comes to reading. \n\nBoth Tinasaurus and I went with the vegetarian omelette,\"quatre fromage\" consisting of fontina, mozarella, gruyere and tartufa cheese with a few avocado slices on top and hugged by salad and za'atar potatoes. The omelette itself was good, I would actually prefer the avocado be immersed from the cheese within but oh well. Combo of cheeses provided a good, cheesy flavor. Fruit components was heavily represented in the salad and the dressing was tasty. I only had ONE POTATO CUBE and it was delicious. \n\nThis place is BYOB and they give you a cute like purple bag with ice to put your 'pagne in. BYOB-ness helps shave down the bill. \n\nOverall this place was good and the depth and uniqueness of the menu is hard to find in Philly but I would have to respectfully disagree with the \"best brunch in philly\" claim however this is a SOLID brunch choice nonetheless.", "date": "2018-05-07 00:16:58", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 598, "average_stars": 3.94, "yelping_since": "2015-09-02 17:30:11"}}

I found this restaurant via yelp due to the great reviews. After broswing the menu I decided that I most definitely had to try this place.\n\nBEST DECISION I'VE MADE IN A WHILE BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS AHHH-MAZING!!!\n\nI sincerely anticipated that it would be everything I hoped and wished for. They have outside seating, which is a plus, but not on a super hot day. For being such a small establishment, the menu is EXTENSIVE. I was shocked. It may be overwhelming to some, but not me. I need options, and they give them to you. The seating is close, but it is a caf\u00e9. They also have another room for seating in another room which you may not see at first. I don't know if this is policy, but we seated ourselves which was no issue at all.\n\nAnd this establishment is BYOB!\n\nI pregamed. I searched and reviewed the menu before hand. I ordered the Berrylicious Pain Perdu. This was RIGHT up my alley.\n\nOur food came out relatively fast. My dish was PERFECT. All od the differenr fruit flavors fused together with the sweetness of the cheese, delicious. I ordered a side of turkey bacon, which i greatly appreciated that it was even available. That, could have been cooked more, but that's my bad for not asking for it to be fried hard. I tasted my friends sweet potato hash, and it was also very tasty. We had brought champagne to have mimosas. We ordered pitchers of OJ, which could have been bigger for the price, but the orange juice was fresh, and scrumptious... sooo who cares! \n\nThe container to chill the bottles was a tad small. Our bottle barely fit in it. But one of the employees came over and said she'd have to order bigger ones so that all bottle sizes could be accommodated. When they tried to ice our bottle all of the water from the ice spilled everywhere. They cleaned it up super fast. very attentive.\n\nOur server told us it was his first day. When it was time to pay, he somehow swiped my card twice. Once for my transaction, and once for another. I notcied this not long after i left. I called, told them what the problem was, and they took all of my information, and told me that someone else would be calling me. When i did talk to this lady, she was nice and said they'd review their transactions to give me a refund if they were at fault. This was on a Monday. She called me back Wednesday to tell me they were indeed at fault, and my card was being refunded. \n\nGREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! No bitterness on my end, and i completely plan on returning.\n\nPS: All of you Green Eggs Caf\u00e9 fans... this places compares, and KNOCKS the competition out of the roof. Wayyy better than GEC, and a wayyyy bigger menu. More space, and faster service. Definitely worth trying.\n\n***2nd visit a week later Labor Day***\n\nWe had about an hr's wait. They chilled my bottle for me as we waited to be seated. The owner and his wife are what every business owner should be. Hospitable, kind, and they deliver EXCELLENT customer service. They talk to their customers, not on a business level, but on a friendly note. Like they appreciate your business. They stopped at our table numerous times just for small talk even tho it was super busy. That alone will keep me coming back.\n\nThis visit I insisted that my family come with me to experience this greatness. Our food took a little ling coming out, so what did they do? They gave us a free appetizer. I had the salmon burger which was DELICIOUS. The food is uncomparable to any other Mediterranean food places. Why? BECAUSE IT IS AUTHENTIC. I wouldn't be surprised if they have their mothers back in the kitchen cooking. Knowing my name from when i checked in for a table, I'm walking down the street and the owner comes running after me calling my name. I had forgotten my sunglasses. And he went out of his way and chased me down. \n\nI had a Salmon burger, which was so delicious. It had ginger coleslaw, which was nothing short of amazing. Also try the macaroons!

I came here once, in January of this year, and it still sticks out to me as singularly one of the worst dining experiences of recent memory. Or of all time, really. I hate the idea of giving anyone a one star review, but that's what this place deserves.\n\nFirst, and this holds absolutely no bearing on my one star rating, is it's location. I've moved just outside of the city but I still don't know why I thought I could drive there and find parking at 10am on a sunday. in January. Foolish on my part. Spent at least 30min driving around looking for legal 2hr parking. At least this place doesn't take reservations so we're not actually late for anything, right?\n\nMy friend and I walk in, and the atmosphere is very cozy, euro. We're seated nearly immediately, with the request that there's space for three as we're hopeful a friend can join us after their current obligation. \"No Problem!\" We're sitting in the elevated bar stools/booths in the front by the counter. Out comes the menu, which despite being food obsessed, I'll admit it was difficult to envision all of the flavors presented in each option. Overwhelming but not necessarily negative. Until, of course, you see the prices. I'm more than capable of spending $25 on FOOD ONLY for myself for a brunch entree whenever I want, but damn, it had better be good. $17 for a basic omellet? Holy hell. And what made it more difficult to take in was the near CONSTANT checking in by the staff. For the first two minutes, I just figured they were being attentive, but when three different, bored looking wait staff asks if you're ready to order 8 times within 5 minutes of receiving the menu... difficult not to see it as pushy. \n\nAfter we order, the table that's very close, right next to us, gets their food. The guy tells the waitress immediately \"oh, I asked for the sauce on the side\" and clearly the entire plate was smothered in it. The waitress' response? \"It's so good, you'll be licking it off your fingers, trust me\" and walks away. I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it. $23 on a meal that you're told to enjoy the way it's given to you, despite your stated preference??? \n\nCoffee was good, service very timely, as again, despite being readily seated, no reservations accepted and the high prices, the employees give you the feeling you're at a busy nj diner. Food was absolutely sad and disappointing. My entree came with wheat bread at the bottom...more like a pepperidge farm wheat thin sitting in a bewilderingly bland mess, soggy, but those factory holes in the \"bread\" were still retaining their shape. My avocado was brown. The rest...its not that I can't recall, it's more that I had no idea what I was even seeing on my plate to begin with. The only yummy part was the petite side salad which occupied no more than 1.5 square inches on my plate. As my friend and I are picking at our bizarre, expensive messes, our third friend comes in and grabs the seat at our table. We explain to him that we're just finishing up but if he didn't mind waiting for us, he can join us on our walk afterward. A waitress comes by, asks what he'd like and he pointed out that as we're halfway through our meal, he'll just take some water. \"No problem!\" They take our barely eaten mush away, refill my coffee and we continue our engaging conversation. Five minutes later, our check arrives. Ten minutes later, we're all settled and I'm finishing up my coffee and conversation when the owner comes by and, I fucking kid you not, ASKS US TO LEAVE. Paraphrasing: \"we have so many people waiting\" and, word for word \"I WAS NICE ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOUR FRIEND TO SIT HERE\". Excuse me??? I asked him BEFORE we were seated for a place for 3. I have not lingered past any appropriate length for brunch (that 2hr parking is a strong motivational force), we sat through a dismal meal, with pushy and hovering waitresses, and despite all of this, I STILL tipped 25% because that's what I always do as the bare minimum. I was stunned. Out of all of the restaurants I've been to all over this Earth, I have *never* been asked to leave to make room for others. And certainly not so haughtily. Sadly, I couldn't think of a way to say this to him other than \"you're out of your god damn mind\" so we got up and left after I had my last sip of coffee. Sadly, had he waited an additional five minutes or less, we would have been getting up on our own accord.\n\nTLDR; what an irritating, arrogant, and unappetizing euro-fusion mess. MAYBE I was unfortunate enough to come here on an \"off day\" for the cooking staff, waitresses and owner, but I think it's more accurate\u200b to say I got a real glimpse at what this place is all about and it's garbage...not even the kind Frank Reynolds would enjoy.", "date": "2017-06-04 04:06:14", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 6, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2015-02-09 17:19:22"}}

The portions are large and the dishes are tasty. They really put effort in making the food presentable and unique! \n\nMy main complaints are the service. When my friend and I arrived, the man who seemed to own the establishment (as he did not have an apron on and seemed to walk around often greeting guests) abruptly asked us how many people there were and consistently reminded us every 5 minutes that they'd get busy (with no tables available soon) if our friends didn't show up quickly. This was ok - I totally understand as a server myself that you want your guests to be aware of the situation! But what ticked us off was his demeanor. While he was rather standoffish to us, he was INCREDIBLY nice to other (Caucasian) guests who were either seated or walked in. His short and rash exchanges with us vs his courteous jokes and friendly attitude with other customers was off putting. This made us feel uncomfortable as minorities and a tad unwelcome. This was actually the second time my friend encountered this type of treatment as a minority here; she recognized the man right from when we first saw him outside. \n\nThe other servers, however, were kind and offered excellent service when we were seated and dined! \n\nI would also like to note that the prices here are more expensive for brunch as opposed to other places in the city. Each dish is roughly $17-30. It's worth it for some dishes, but definitely not for others! For example, the Mediterranean Platter is literally yogurt, hummus, pita and veggies for $19.50! In this case, you'd be paying for presentation - which is totally fine but not necessarily bang for your buck. \n\nLastly, parking here can be an issue sometimes! The location has no parking lot so street parking is your only option. It can be quite competitive as it's a mix of a lot of residential townhouses and a couple other eating establishments! \n\nOverall, it's a decent establishment but I will probably not be dining here again soon.", "date": "2020-10-23 06:17:56", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 338, "average_stars": 4.01, "yelping_since": "2013-08-17 23:09:42"}}

I was visiting my brother who lives in the area. We were a party of 4 + a baby and we were greeted by a very friendly gentleman and was seated promptly. The place looked really cute and he seated us at the corner so we'd have more room and be more comfortable. This is where our pleasant experience stopped. \nWe ordered our food and a few minutes later the waiter brought a small plate of fresh mozzarella and tomato to our table. We assumed that it was complementary and I started to feed my daughter the tomato and cheese. The waitress rudely came\nOver to our table and accusingly said \"did you order this?!\" And I was so confused and said \"no\nBut it was brought to our table so we assumed..\" She cut me off and said that she can't take it back because we already ate it. So we said just add it to our tab, she still decided to continue to say more to make us feel really uncomfortable for HER mistake and basically make me feel guilty for feeding the food to my hungry one year old daughter. This alone spoiled our entire meal and we were not able to enjoy our lunch. She then hovered over us while we were eating our lunch and once my mom and brother finished their meals,  she immediately grabbed their plates. My mom wasn't quite finished and still had another bite or two left and she stood there until my mom finished to snatch her plate away. When we all finally finished our meals suddenly our waitress was nowhere in sight. I had to take my daughter to the front and pay where there were three waitresses who were clearly annoyed by the fact that I stood up to go and pay my check. I came back to my table and a waitress followed me. She started grabbing at the rest of our plates haphazardly asking if we needed anything else. (Uh..

Cafe La Maude is the epitome of a small European restaurant serving high quality coffee drinks and brunch foods. The menu looked absolutely overwhelming since there were so many delicious-sounding foods listed. The prices are on the higher side, but this is one of the rare occasions where I would say that the price is totally worth it.\n\nI had the Le Chef Omelet, which was recommended to me as the best vegetarian omelet on the menu. I had to ask for a recommendation because it would have taken forever if I had to decide on my own. Absolutely loved that the servers were super helpful and accommodating to any dietary preferences or restrictions (they told me that they could make any substitutions or alterations to make something vegetarian), which is awesome, especially after having to deal with some restaurants that are really stubborn about substitutions.\n\nThe omelet dish that I received was so amazingly delicious. It came with a really refreshing side salad and fruit salad along with another side of potatoes. The presentation was Food Network worthy - I spent a good 5-10 minutes to take pictures of (and with) the beautiful dish. Regarding the flavors, I thought that the ingredients in the omelet meshed so well together. There was the slight crispiness from the cauliflower along with the creaminess of the avocado and hummus and brought together with fresh veggies and perfectly cooked egg whites. The potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning and crunch as well, and I could tell that the vegetable and fruit salad were very fresh. The portion was pretty large as well. I honestly have no negative things to say about this dish - I wish my stomach were larger so that I could have finish every last crumb! \n\nMy sister, who is much younger and much pickier than I am, ordered the grilled cheese and a large hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was so wonderfully frothy that my sister could not have been any happier (she's a huge chocolate fan). She thought the grilled cheese had great flavor because of the really good melding together of the different cheeses that they used and wasn't too buttery.\n\nI do think that a large part of my love for this cafe has to do with the ambiance. the decor is very cute, European, and definitely picture-worthy. There seem to be many locals who frequent this cafe, and it's very refreshing as a newcomer to see individuals coming in one-by-one, giving each other friendly hellos and chatting it up on a Wednesday morning. The owner joined many of these people in conversation, which just added to the cozy and intimate vibe of the cafe. The cafe is also pet-friendly, so my sister and I were joined by an adorable chihuahua during our brunch! \n\nI love all things about this cafe and think that the pleasant service and delicious food are definitely worth the price that you pay.

We arrived quite early on a Sunday and as a result had no problem getting a table.   (I had called ahead but there are no reservations.   However, the server indicated that before 10 or so there should not be a problem.)\n\nWe sat at one of the two marble tables near the window which was surprisingly warm for that day.   There is 1/2 booth-1/2 chair seating along the wall and mostly table seating in the rear (where there is limited natural light).   The place has that \"cool vibe\".   Black and white are the primary colors here with pictures of puppies along the wall in the front.\n\nThere are almost too many choices on the menu.  (I peeked before we came and still had problems choosing.)   One is better than the next.   On the breakfast all day, there is a mix of French and Middle Eastern (specifically Lebanese) influences.   We sipped coffee as we struggled with decision and this is the first time I knowingly drank LaColombe coffee.   It is rich and robust, and was very fresh.\n\nWe finally decided on the Croque Madame and the Parisian Za.    The latter was suggested by the server as it is one of their more popular selections.   This was overall a well balanced plate with a bit of fruit, a bit of salad, what was to be brioche but tasted like croissant with caramelized onion, ham, and goat cheese - I am a sucker for goat cheese - and two eggs over easy.    These eggs were perfectly cooked in butter with no signed of browning as a result of the eggs being dropped into an overheated pan.  Overall, this was  winner.  \n\nService was a bit overzealous.   We were asked at least 5 times by three different people how things were.   In the middle of the meal, a person we had yet to encounter decided to rearrange plates and cups for us (square plates do not work very well on small round tables).   Once, I get my plate or coffee cup, please don't touch it until I'm done with it.   It is a pet peeve of mine.  \n\nOnce we were done, we were asked if we wanted anything else.   Of course, the question was, \"What else do you have?\" after we had been sitting and staring a  dessert case of croissant, cookies, and mmmmmmmmmmmmmacarons.     The server started naming the flavors and we stopped her at salted caramel.   We each had one and these were the perfect foil for the coffee.\n\nBy this time the place was filled and we were getting that strong hint to leave.  I wanted to stop in the restroom before we left and as I walked to the rear a waitress, without my asking said, \"All the way in the back to the right.\"   I mention this only because as I approached the back of the place I saw these curtains framing an open area to the left and started moving in that direction only to find myself slamming into a floor to ceiling mirror.   The woman waiting to get into the single bathroom giggled, and said, \"I did the SAME thing the first time I was here.\"   So fellow Yelpers, watch out for the mirror all the way in the back on the left.\n\nWhen I arrived back at the table they had taken my dining partner's coffee cup, but I wasn't leaving mine behind.   Two quick gulps, and we were gone.\n\nThere is a sign posted to let you know that this is not the place to bring your laptop or iPad and work as you drink the great coffee.   Eat, pay, and go.  This is understandable but also very obvious.\n\nFood is 5 stars.  Service 4.\n\nParking here is challenging as this is strictly a residential neighborhood with plenty of residential garages and the driveways eliminate street parking at the driveway apron of the garage.  There is no commercial lot in sight.\n\nSo come with someone with a small car or be prepared to walk a bit, but it is definitely worth the effort.", "date": "2015-01-26 00:33:13", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 1470, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2011-07-16 13:51:50"}}

The male manager then followed us into the store next door to tell us that the woman couldn't possibly be homophobic because she has a lesbian family member. \n\nWell I guess no gay person has ever been rejected by their family, so that settles it!", "date": "2018-11-25 20:54:59", "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 2, "average_stars": 3.0, "yelping_since": "2018-11-25 20:45:37"}}

Loved the dessert display and the picture frames of dogs. \n\nHowever, the food was okay. Nothing great. I ordered poached eggs with canadian bacon and the egg was not poached. It was soft boiled so i didn't get that oozing effect that a poached egg would give you which was disappointing. \n\nThe food wasnt the worst part. The customer service was. Our server (male) handed us the menu and left without explaining anything on the special menu. I didnt even realize that there was a special menu until i looked at the chalk board 10 mins later and the server caught me looking at it and then he began to explain. Later when we began to order, my boyfriend asked the server whats the dish that the girl got next to us and he was clueless. You can tell he was not sure and he just guessed. But later he found out and my boyfriend ordered that dish. No problems with his dish. \n\nAnother thing that bothered me is when four women came to sit down next to us and the same server greet them with a smile and told them the special menu and even asked them if they had any questions they could let him know. But not once did he greet us with a smile or explain anything on the menu. And Im not sure if they have two different sizes of orange juice, but i just saw this couple with a larger glass cup of oj when i passed by. My bf got a small dinky plastic cup and the price was still $3 something. Not a very good first impression at all. \n\nOverall the food is okay but the customer service was horrible and it wasnt even that busy...i would have given them a 1 star for customer service and 3 stars for food.

I have horrible food allergies and an extremely restricted diet.  I initially went to Soy Cafe way back when because of their name figuring it was a place I could find some good vegan food.\n\nWhen I saw that the menu included TWENTY TWO smoothies made with soy milk and honey I was so happy.  I am a huge smoothie fan!  My favorite smoothie is the Milk Vanilla:  peach, banana, vanilla, soy milk, honey.  Note for vegans who don't eat honey:  good maple syrup is available to substitute.  I always get the soy protein add-on.  It makes the smoothie richer and creamier (thus yummier).  :)  The Milk Vanilla + soy protein became my favorite smoothie of all time upon first sip.  I've been ordering this smoothie for over 5 years on a regular basis and have been impressed by the consistency shown by the staff.  They always make it the same way every time:  just right.  Highly recommend coming here for your smoothie fix!\n\nAnd there's more!  :)\n\nThe salads are phenomenal.  Very generously sized and brimming with perfect, delicious, extremely fresh veggies (and fruit in some!).  My favorite is the Avocado Grapefruit Salad...even though I can't have grapefruit.  The staff is always happy to substitute apples, oranges, or another fruit of my choice.  This salad comes with a bed mixed field greens, a sliced avocado, grapefruit, thin long curly tendrils of crisp carrots and beets, sliced cucumber, sliced tomato, and a generous sprinkling of toasted almonds.  This salad also might come with peppers and onions but I can't have those so I always ask for those to be held.  The dressing is house made fresh from scratch daily.  It's an apple carrot ginger dressing that is amazing!\n\nIf you are going to enjoy a hot tea I highly recommend the Green Tea with Roasted Rice.  The roasted rice gives the green tea a light nutty note that is particularly lovely.  It pairs especially well with one of the Sweet Toasts:  Honey Nut (sliced bananas, toasted almond chips, honey) or the Elvis Special (sliced bananas and peanut butter).  Choices of bread include Russian Black, whole wheat, and multigrain.  Tea is served by the pot or the cup if you stay - I prefer to get the pot.  It's definitely not too much for one person if you're planning to take your time and relax.  It's great for 2 people as well.\n\nThe Vanilla Oatmeal with honey soy milk is phenomenal.  I know, it's just oatmeal but...wow.  I got it one morning on a whim and was like, this is the best oatmeal I have ever had EVER.  It's just...so, so good.  Perfect comfort breakfast on a rainy morning!\n\nSoy Cafe also offers some really unique coffee drinks.  For an especially indulgent treat I love the Espresso Milkshake (shot of espresso, 2 scoops of soy ice cream, soy milk, honey)!  It's decadent, delicious, and perfect for a hot day.  The Vanilla Java (shot of espresso, vanilla, cinnamon, soy milk, honey) tastes exotic.  I prefer this drink hot but you can choose to have it served cold, blended with ice.  The Mocha-cha-cha (shot of espresso, cocoa, soy milk, honey) has just the right amount of cocoa in it - it's like hot chocolate and espresso had a baby!  Yum.  All coffee is Fair Trade organic.  Inquire about specific varieties.\n\nThe Soy Special Drinks have some big winners too.  The Soy Chai has harmonious, balanced notes that come together with the soy milk perfectly.  Nothing is overdone (I really hate too much cinnamon or too much clove, yuck!).  The Cocoa Mint Soy is like a Girlscout's Thin Mint in beverage form.  Yum!\n\nThere are always freshly baked vegan and non-vegan treats at the counter.  They are kept separate from each other which someone like me with food allergies really appreciates.  :)  Baked goods vary by the day but there are muffins (gluten free sometimes!), chocolate chip cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and more.  There are even mini cupcakes and muffins so if you are trying to keep to a diet you can still have a little something sweet with your coffee/tea/etc.  And they are just so cute!  :)  My favorites are the cupcakes.  Ahhh, so moist and such yummy frosting!\n\nAnd there is so much more:  wraps, homemade soy milk, fresh squeezed veggie & fruit juices, soups, sandwiches...  I could go on forever, lol!\n\nThe staff is always super friendly and helpful.  The decor is charming and welcoming.  The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  There is free unlimited wifi.  Go solo, go with your other half, go with a group of friends - this cafe is great for grabbing a quick bite or hanging out for a while.  There is even a little outdoor garden!\n\nI really love Soy Cafe.  I can't say enough great things about this wonderful place!  If you don't live nearby it's worthy of making a special trip there.  Plus there is plenty to do in NoLibs after you've had your fill at Soy Cafe, especially on N 2nd Street right where Soy Cafe is located.

Also served with a salad and a homemade dressing which is fantastic.\n-- Miso + Steamed Dumplings - This was incredible. Great miso broth, served in a very large bowl with I think around 6 dumplings, which are also quite excellent. Will order that again for sure. \n-- Seitan Cheesesteak Wrap - I had to try this to see what it was all about. I've seen it as the special every time I go in there, figure lots of people are ordering it, and now I can see why. I like their wraps because there's a full salad in there. I cut mine up so getting bits of the wrap, salad, and seitan on a fork full is a perfect bite. Not too heavy which was my initial concern. Their honey mustard dressing is also to die for. Wish there was a little bit more of that for extra dipping. \n-- BBQ Pork Wrap - Tried this yesterday. Not bad.. I think I liked the seitan cheesesteak wrap better, but worth trying if you're looking to sample veggie proteins. \n\nThe food is a perfect veggie lunch and is also prepared and served in a way I can respect.

I'm not one to get filled up on mush but one Black Banana smoothie (bananas, cocoa, soymilk, peanut butter, oats, and maple syrup instead of honey) and I'm not hungry for hours. It's decadent and rich and very addictive. \n\n* Service is friendly and not snooty and apathetic like some other cafes that are in No Libs/Fishtown-area.\n\n* Good assortment of vegan baked goodies.\n\n* I also love their stash of current mags they have on hand.\n\nCONS: Here is why I can't give Soy Cafe 4 or 5 stars\n\n* One of the  vegan brownies I had was crumbly and flavorless. I believe most of their vegan baked goods come from North Port Fishington, which are always yummy, but whoever supplies the brownies (not North Port) needs to tweak the recipe.\n\n* I've ordered food twice. Bagel and hummus was alright. Tofu sesame salad was wholesome but the tofu is not flavored or cooked. I LOVE tofu--I even pop a plain, uncooked piece in my mouth while cooking--but a heaping plateful of plain tofu is not appetizing (I doubt a plateful of raw chicken on greens would be much better!). \n\n* This is my biggest caveat about the place. I never noticed until yesterday that the amount I was charged for two smoothies seemed off. . I calculated the price myself and realized they round up after adding tax and it is quite significant. My order, with tax, should have been $8.53, but they charged me $8.60. They don't use a cash register or offer receipts. I find this practice very dishonest (Golden Chopsticks on Spring Garden does this too) and if you multiply this by all the customers they serve each day, that's quite a markup. They should price their menu so that, with tax, the prices are a round number or they should stop this practice.\n\nI'll think twice about coming back now that I'm aware of the price hike and I'll mention it next time.

Soy Cafe finally gave me something worth writing about.  My family and I stopped by here for an early dinner after a day at the Zoo and our expectations were far exceeded.  It's a cute place, with cozy seating and very friendly staff.  They were setting up for some big event in the back when we came in but stopped everything to wait on us.\n\nOn to the food-- I had the grilled eggplant on multigrain toast, hold the soy cheese.  This sandwich was far beyond what I expected from a little corner cafe.  The eggplant was done just right (not mushy), the toast was just crusty enough without being too crunchy (and the bread itself was this absolutely delicious multigrain that I'm already craving again).  The best thing was the homemade soy mayo, though, which added a fantastic tang to the sandwich.  I probably could have eaten a shoe dipped in that stuff.  The portion was a perfect size, too-- big enough to be satisfying without being excessive.  Plus it comes with an ample (and aesthetically-pleasing) side salad with a tasty house made dressing.\n\nMy folks got the turkey pesto sandwich and the bella burger on multigrain, respectively, and both raved about their meals as well.  They also shared a berry berry smoothie and loved it (I sipped a chamomile).  At the end of the meal, we also snagged some vegan & wheat-free brownies to go and devoured them later (so chocolatey and decadent - couldn't believe they were vegan!)\n\nTo sum up, this place was fantastic.

And so did I, so I can say that they were VERY good: soft, just the right amount of cinnamon, and the icing was \"lick your fingers good.\" She asked if we wanted them \"for here,\" and we said sure (she warmed them up for us =) ). We also got them out of the wrapper and on to a plate. \nThe banana nut (homemade) muffin was really good too: tasty and moist.

I got it to go, and by the time we got on the El, I wanted to try some (I know there are germs, but it smelled so good). I opened it up and almost freaked out because the vegan ham looked so real! I thought I was given the wrong order possibly (the woman in front of me ordered sandwiches too). But a Google search later, I realized some vegan ham is super thick.

Our neighborhood wasn't always that way, and so it is the case with where Soy Cafe resides. It really helps to have an open mind in life when you try anything that's new to you, and no restaurant can make everyone happy. \n\nI have friends in Philly and make the trip down there from time to time and the Soy Cafe gives me a chance to to stay on track with my mostly vegetarian diet. \n\nSoy Cafe reminds me of New York in the 70's and 80's, when it comes to decor. The old vintage look has plenty of character, and as long as you're comfortable in an old world, casual setting, you'll feel right at home there. Today there are too many food and beverage chains, so to me this is a nice place that fits somewhere between an old pharmacy and a really old bar. What I like most is that it's a very laid back place that has tasteful accents. \n\nThe folks who work there are mostly friendly and courteous, one shouldn't expect the kind of service that many more traditional restaurants have. That said, they get the job done and most importantly are community oriented folks. So as long as you have reasonable expectations from a very minimal staff service wise, you'll be just fine with it. \n\nI've had wraps, sandwiches, salads and deserts. Coming from New York, I find the pricing to be very reasonable, but of course that is relative. The food is fresh and quite good. The Semi Philly styled wrap was very tasty, and the salad I've had was quite a complete offering, which really hit the spot. I'm used to vegan deserts, and these deserts ( ex. Chocolate Cup Cakes) are fresh home baked and are up there with the best of them. I do find that one does have to acquire a taste for these newer vegan recipees, but once you do, it seems as natural as anything else that you've had. \n\nHaving worked in restaurants on and off for a bit over 20 years, I can see that Soy Cafe has a wonderful potential to become a highly appreciated and successful restaurant in it's community. I just think more people who are into vegetarian food, fish and noodles need to know about the place. \n\nI applaud all the hard work that has gone into putting this place together, and sincerely hope you get a chance to try some different dishes so you can get a better idea of what is offered there.

The Berry Berry is my favorite.  There is just something about Soy Cafe's homemade soy milk in the smoothies that makes them about 100 times better than anything I can make in my kitchen.  The Funky Monkey is so much better than such a basic peanut butter and banana smoothie usually would be. I also highly recommend the Hot Apple Cinnamon Soy on a cold day!

My second favorite is the grilled eggplant, either on black Russian toast or in a wrap.

Those were amazing as well! \nI can't even tell you the best part, because there were so many! At first glance, you are enchanted by the ambiance flowing out from the cafe. A beautifully decorated outdoor seating area immediately welcomes you into the cafe. Then upon entry to the cafe, you are greeted by a friendly staff member surrounded by a small boutique like setting. Intricate paper crafts and other novelties adorn the shelves. And what's more, is the items are created by local Philadelphians between the ages of 18-80. Maybe that's the best part. By the time you order, you have fallen completely in love with this small cafe. My mama ordered a delicious avocado toast with poached eggs. While I ordered a savory mushroom toast with fried eggs. The pictures don't do it justice. The chef, who personally delivered our food, was very kind and catered to our every wish. \nIf you ever get a chance to visit Philadelphia, please check this place out. You won't regret it.", "date": "2021-09-05 03:02:36", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 10, "average_stars": 4.1, "yelping_since": "2014-06-01 07:23:10"}}

They have Elixir coffee and incredibly orange-yolked eggs, presumably from Lancaster Farm Fresh. We had a scrumptious mushroom toast with poached eggs, which were perfectly poached, and an English breakfast, which was also tasty but pretty heavy on the beans with a tasty but slightly undercooked and inauthentic cheddar scone. \n\nThe cappuccinos were decent but not as good as actually at Elixir and also served in paper. I'm not sure if everything was on disposable ware because we were outside or if that's normal, but it did take away from the meal. The cutlery in particular was a problem, the knife totally unequal to the eggs Benedict my friend had.

That is something I never do ever, as I usually try to experience as many spots in a city as humanly possible while traveling. But I was so smitten with Frieda that I genuinely looked forward to returning.\n\nMISSION: Frieda is an intergenerational restaurant, community center, art gallery, bakery, and coffee shop. Its primary identity may be a restaurant, but they often flip the space for workshops, readings, and other cool classes. They sell amazing local goods by local makers, and I love their statement about their artists, bakers and employees: \"And while you're here, know that any money you spend at FRIEDA helps us create fair-wage jobs for people of all generations - many of them retired, but still needing to work to make ends meet - as well as support our Outreach Community Program.\"\n\nFOOD + DRINK: Reasonably priced and crave-worthy. The salmon avocado toast was beautifully presented, had delicious flavor and was very generous. As for bakery, my Mom and I both agreed their croissant was the best we've ever had. Thick but still flaky and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate. The London Fog and other coffee drinks we had were always well-made and satisfying.\n\nSERVICE + VIBE: Nahir is amazing. I actually hugged him on my final visit! We had so many great chats about Frieda's programs, the menu, and just Philly in general. He went above and beyond. The vibe here is very white and minimal, but open and airy. You get a great feeling just sitting there and existing.\n\nI wish this spot was in Cleveland because I'm obsessed with its multi-faceted approach to community and its inclusiveness. I can't recommend it enough!

Programming includes book clubs, language groups, meditation groups, language groups. You name it, they have it, virtually or (slowly) in person. \n\nThe cafe is set up outdoors on the sidewalk and in a couple parking spaces. They have had this set up since before the days of Covid, but it became essential after the shutdown. They also have limited seating indoors, if interested. The outdoors space includes lots of greenery, so even if you are near a table, you may have a large plant or 2 placed between the tables for privacy. Nice touch!\n\nThe food is still on point. They offer a breakfast menu all morning and afternoon and a lunch menu at lunch. They have takeout dinners as well. They will deliver to nearby zip codes. The pastries are some of the best in the Philly area (have you TRIED their almond croissants?!?!). \n\nCheck out Frieda in the 2020s.

I wanted to learn a lot about it to include in my review. Frieda is a great spot to get lunch solo or with friends/colleagues, study quietly, or join a group. Let me elaborate:\n\nFrieda offers a menu of fresh breakfast, lunch, and pastry items. You can get a sandwich, wrap, or salad or opt for a frittata or soup. Their pastries are made on the spot, often in view of the cafe. I love watching them make their cakes and sweet delicacies. There's quite an art to it. My favorite sandwiches are a toss up: some days it's the curry chicken wrap; others it's the turkey with their delicious Frieda chutney. I've become such a regular that the staff greets me warmly and knows I'll be asking for a hot chai latte. Oh yes, their looseleaf teas and lattes are great as well!\n\nTheir motto is CONNECTING GENERATIONS. This is the second part of Frieda I was curious about. I didn't understand, so I asked staff to explain. They offer a great space for people to come and play games. There's frequently a table or 3 of ladies playing Mahjong around 1 PM on weekdays. They also have sign-up sheets on the front wall near the door. They have a movie club, book club, German- and French-language clubs...really, this place has it all. They wanted to open a space where people could come and meet others of all ages and interact. They also have a great program where senior citizens make the pastries and jars of jelly. Frieda pays them fair wage. Now, who can't get behind a mission like Frieda's?! I love the place. \n\nFrieda is nestled on Walnut Street between 3rd and 4th Streets.

It's located away from the more popular haunts on 10th street, but it's a great little establishment where you can grab a quick meal (they specialize in Taiwanese cuisine) or ruminate life over specialty teas or coffee.\n\nMy friend and I visited Ray's Caf\u00e9 on a rainy Saturday afternoon. They had just opened for the day, so the shop was pretty empty but we were greeted by the friendly staff and were quickly seated. Ray's doesn't have much in terms of decor, but what you're really there for is the food and drinks! On with it.\n\nWe started off with an order of Pork & Napa dumplings as well as our drinks. Now, reading some other Yelp reviews, I knew I had to try the \"Syphon\"-brewed coffee. It's pretty pricey (a cup runs $5-$10 depending on the coffee), but I thought I would splurge a bit since my trip to Philly was a vacation-of-sorts. \n\nNow, the Syphon-brewed coffee is only available for the specialty coffees that Ray's has featured, which are sourced from around the world. I opted for the Japanese charcoal-roasted coffee. Now, the fun part -- watching it brew from behind the counter in this contraption straight out of a mad scientist's library. It's pretty neat to watch the water bubble and the coffee infuse, and the end product was a smooth, silky cup of coffee. The Japanese roast was mild and not very acidic. It paired great with just a touch of cream and sugar. The coffee is also served with a little cookie!\n\nNow, the food. The aforementioned dumplings came in an order of eight, and they were juicy, hot, and delicious. I enjoyed the texture of the dumpling skin, which was a bit thicker than I'm used to, and the flavors of the filling. For my entr\u00e9e, I opted for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which was perfect for the brisk, gloomy day. There were plentiful noodles, beef, and veggies all submersed in a rich, flavorful broth. It was a very cost-friendly meal that left me plenty stuffed.\n\nOverall, Ray's colored me impressed and I definitely want to come back next time I'm in Philly. They have plenty more coffee options and Taiwanese food options left to try!\n\nSome Final Tips:\n- It's a small shop, so larger groups probably aren't the best, but tables can comfortably accommodate four people. \n- Brunch items are served on Saturdays!\n- Closed on Sundays!", "date": "2016-05-09 00:33:57", "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 160, "average_stars": 3.63, "yelping_since": "2013-05-23 22:07:51"}}

I liked the atmosphere. So i did the job of a customer to express my appreciation. Every. Time.\n\nToday I went and ordered my food politely. But the boss decides to say these words to my face, before she even left with the order. \n\n\"This is dine in, so you know you have to leave 15-18% tip. This is your choice, if you don't want to leave tip you can order take out. Do you want to order take out? Because you've been here many times and you never leave tip. Last time you left a dime.\" and she left. \n\nHow in the world does she think she has the right to scold me? Incredible. I am so sure that I've always left more than the 18% tip she so grudgingly specified. The food isn't even that good, but I keep on returning because I thought it was a friendly place with a nice atmosphere. And I believe that tip is simply a way to express gratitude to good service, which is completely up to me, not her. Are those few dollars really worth losing a potential regular? She scolded me like a mother would to her misbehaving child, I can't describe how rude and offensive it was. And she had the audacity to do it. She had the audacity to tell me to leave tip after scolding me. \n\nCongratulations.

Sporting an elegant, cozy seating environment (something like Starbucks minus the couches) - they offer the best coffee I have ever had to date. (Much much better than those franchise coffee places) \n\nTheir coffee is bred to perfection as you literally taste every drop that goes through your mouth. When you are done, you feel so energized and satisfied that you will probably order another one. \n\nI had the Hawaiian (their top of their line coffee aka the \"King\" of coffee) served very elegantly in small tray which also comes with a delicious cookie. Wow, halfway through it my mind just lit up and I could not stop smiling. \n\nI also ordered a regular ice coffee which was very delicious, and ice coffee with vanilla ice cream which was just as great. But it is their hot coffee which shines the most. \n\nOne drawback is you will pay a price - it is very expensive. The Hawaiian cost 7 dollars for a mere cup. (literally, a cup) But, if you make this an occasional trip - it won't hurt you but only give you instant satisfaction.  Their ice coffee runs about 5 dollars and you won't get much either but to me it was worth the experience for a traveler. \n\nOne more thing I highly recommend as your are sipping their delicious coffee. Actually, two. First, I highly recommend you to try their Dumpling Sampler - which 5 different sets of delicious dumplings. I mean - these aren't your regular asian dumplings - they are made to literal perfection and when combined with their two different sauces - only pushes it beyond perfection.The Dumpling Sampler includes 2 Veggies(very very good), 2 fried curry chicken (very good and crispy), 2  chicken ( the most average ) , 2 pork with leek (very good), and one more which I forgot. They are also beautifully served in a traditional chinese dish, and a marvel because all come in different colors! \n\nAgain, you pay the price because it cost $7.50 for 10 dumplings. Second, try their smoothies! I had a mango smoothie and I was stunned that they also produce smoothies as good as their coffee!\n\nRemember to visit when in Philly! I'll add pictures of their food and storefront soon.\n\nP.S - They take credit cards on orders 15 dollars and over combined. Also, I saw many people did not leave tips because they feel they are at a Starbucks environment; but please leave tips because you are being served.

We ordered our 20 year old favorite - the dumpling sampler which was served with the traditional dumpling sauce as well as a hot pepper sauce.

In addition you get 2 deep fried chicken curry dumplings.   All were plump and delicious, but tepid.

This is how Ray's feels to me. Few times have I visited while other people were there. I feel like its location amidst the sea of thousands of Chinese food restaurants in Chinatown has kept it a secret. \n\nI love coffee...and thought I was well-versed and somewhat of a connoisseur, yet I knew nothing of the siphon coffee they prepare at Ray's. They have a bunch of specialty blends (like the $8.50/cup Jamaican Blue Mt), and also a bunch of their own blends (like the \"Philadelphia\" and \"New York\" blends).  Each coffee on the menu highlights a different attribute in the bean/blend (acidity, smoothness...) so there is something for everyone! \n\nSo here's the process: A specific amount of the whole bean of the blend/bean of your choice is weighed out, then ground, and placed in what looks like a vacuum filter from a chemistry lab. A flask with water is then placed over a flame with the vacuum filter (containing the coffee) placed on top of it. When the water in the flask boils it travels up into the filter, mixing with the coffee. They stir with what looks like a paintbrush, and when the flame is turned off the now-brewed coffee travels back down into the flask! It's about a 5 minute affair, and what comes out is perfection. Served in a beautiful cup, with a tiny pail of heavy cream and delicious cookie, it is heaven. \n\nI'm not done yet! The food is friggin AWESOME! I ALWAYS order the shrimp curry rice noodles because it's sooo gooooood! I've eaten some of my friends tofu dishes they ordered and they were delish as well.

That is great :' ) \n\nYou can buy the coffee beans there too, and I would insanely recommend buying the Ray's House blend. It is easily one of the most delicious coffees.

(At this point, my heart was already full.)\n\nI had never had siphon coffee before, so the owner's son (we never got his name but with my creepy detective skills, I think his name is Lawrence) told us all about how the process works while we watched him brew it right in front of us (it looks like a chemistry experiment!). I got the sumiyaki and my friend got the Jamaican blue coffee and Lawrence gave us the extras from both so that we could try each other's. Looking at the coffee, you can tell it's going to be the smoothest coffee you've ever had. I'm not even a regular coffee drinker, and when I do I usually have a latte, but I was able to drink the siphon coffee black (probably because it was also accompanied by a cute little chocolate-dipped shortbread cookie that is from the same Greek place they've been getting them from for the last 30 years). It's pricey but well worth it!\n\nWe also ordered the beef tomato rice which was like tomato egg rice (the ultimate classic Chinese comfort food) with corn/peas/carrots, beef, and ketchup. So so cozy. We also got the popular dumpling sampler; they were all plump and juicy and everything I wanted.\n\nThere was delicious homemade chili oil as well, which is a labor of love by Lawrence's brother who grinds the peppers himself and has to arm himself with goggles/gloves when he makes it. You can take some home for about $4 a container - do it and thank me later.\n\nMy friend and I were enjoying our morning slowly so by the end of the meal we had talked to Lawrence quite a bit. After we got the check he even gave us a slice of the cheesecake (I LOVE cheesecake so to say I was excited is an understatement) which was accompanied by coffee jelly and espresso beans. The cheesecake was smooth, creamy, and not too sweet. It was made by his brother who came up with a recipe from lots of Youtube research and taste testing by a friend who is also a cheesecake aficionado. \n\nThe hospitality I experienced here reminded me of why I love Philly so much, and you can see how much pride the Ray family has in their cafe and how much care and intentionality was involved in the food/drinks from beginning to end (even in selecting the dishes/utensils).

My fiance and I recently tried this place after hearing great things time and time again from other local patrons.  This unassuming restaurant, which seats about 10 patrons, is serving up fresh bread, French pastries and delicious breakfast.  \n\nOn the weekends, we've stopped in for breakfast and were surprised to see a full menu of delicious options.  Thus far, we've had the Creme Brulee Omelette, which is a delicious omelette filled with spinach and mushrooms, served with a fresh slice of house made bread (so good) and your choice of breakfast potatoes or mixed greens.  The mixed greens are tossed in a delicious house made dressing, which is perfectly balanced and refreshing.  The waffles are served with fresh berries and sweetened condensed milk and come with a side of scrambled eggs.  While lots of restaurants have waffles on the menu, this place knows how to make a great waffle, which had the slightest hint of sweetness and was perfectly cooked. The french toast is also very good and came paired with scrambled eggs too.  On the weekends they just started making Chai teas, perfectly created and served by the owner's sister in law, a trained barista, who is coming down from NYC on the weekends to help this budding establishment.  \n\nThe pastries are also delicious.  We've had the most delicious miniature tart pies and croissants, not to mention the macaroons, which are also house made. Most pastries run about $3.50.  Everything here is just so good!  Also for those who like fresh juice, Armando (the owner) and his team prepare fresh juice daily, ranging in price from $3.00-5.00.   \n\nThe owner is also just SO nice and kind.  He eagerly shared his vision for the restaurant and let us know they close in the evening for reservations only, serving fresh fish and mussels in addition to other options.

The food is AMAZING. Armando, the chef and I believe owner, is wonderful. He even gave us a run down of the pastries and desserts which look amazing in the case. I could only give this place 3 stars because for dessert we ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I mean that is the name of the restaurant and I actually came for this dessert specifically. When the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e came to the table, the top which is supposed to be BRULEE'd, meaning a hard top just torched was a liquid syrup, literally. So they serve it right out of the case and it appears that they br\u00fbl\u00e9e it a day or even days before. You absolutely cannot serve Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e without the top coat of sugar being hard. It was literally a brown syrup. We sent it back and the server seemed to torch the syrup on top that had already been previously brulee'd. THEN, he put salt all over the top, it was GROSS and the top was a charcoal black all over. I was so disappointed and it was really really bad. The sad thing is, is that the custard/ creme was yummy but it doesn't matter if you can't br\u00fbl\u00e9e the top properly. There is an easy fix, torch the custard per order, it should not be sitting in the case already brulee'd getting soft. The server tried to explain to us that the refrigerator case softens the top and that the temperature was the reason why it doesn't come out right. If you name your restaurant Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, you have to do Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e right. If I had just come for that desert, I would never have come back.

I came for a sandwich which was not available. Which is their option.  But my to-go chai was placed on the counter with no lid and rudely told she would make an exception \"this time\" re payment.

Combined with the traffic on Baltimore ave., the kids playing in the park across the street, and the birds chirping (I love spring!) I had the perfect grant-writing soundtrack.  My iPod stayed in my bag the whole time, but as far as music is concerned, I did hear the Arctic Monkeys coming through the stereo at one point.  I'm not sure if it was from Firehouse or Satellite, though.\n\nBut here's what seals the deal:  I'm sitting in the shade, writing this on a wi-fi connection called \"Drink More Coffee!\" while looking at a beautiful garden and feeling the breeze drift by.

The issue is freshness.  Who knows how long the teas have been sitting there?  They have a huge selection and turnover is low.  I've ordered tea here and, even for types of tea that tend to keep a long time, like black tea, it doesn't tend to taste very fresh.\n\nThere is also an issue with freshness of baked goods.  I ordered a cookie here once and it had a printed date of about a week ago, on the cookie.  Contrast this with other places, even in the neighborhood, where you can buy baked goods.  Four Worlds bakery sells stuff baked in the morning, and you can taste the difference in freshness.  I even think that other cafes, like Green Line and Metropolitan tend to stock consistently fresher baked goods.  I notice that both Green Line and Metropolitan mark down their old baked goods to half price, so that they quickly clear out.  Satellite doesn't (at least as far as I know) and instead it keeps a big stock of stuff, and then it isn't fresh.\n\nI really would like to see Satellite ramp up the freshness of the baked goods and the tea.  Seriously, CLEAR OUT THE WHOLE FREAKING STOCK OF TEA AND THROW IT OUT.\n\nAnd pare down your selection--including both tea and baked goods.  Like, stock only a few types of each, whatever ones are the best sellers, and stock them in a small enough quantity that they sell out.  With baked goods, ideally, get them in fresh every day or every other day and quickly mark down the day-old ones that don't sell.  With tea, the margin of error is much longer, but ideally, plan on restocking each tea every 3 months or so.  And store the tea in metal tins, not glass jars--the light makes it spoil much faster.\n\nThen, as you build a reputation for top-notch, fresh tea and baked goods, start working up to build a selection as you're building up the volume of sales.  That's how I'd run this (or any) business, and I think it would really ramp it up, probably to a five star establishment.\n\nI just can't in good faith give more than 2 stars when I've had such non-fresh stuff here.", "date": "2014-01-02 22:05:41", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 629, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2007-05-03 21:52:54"}}

BIG TIP: if you are looking for basement shows in west philly, this tack board is a good place to find some. The interior is relatively small but deceptively spacious.

I went for the first time about a month ago and pulled a triple header (three days in a row) of ordering the Bike Shop Bagel and a large mug (hand-formed if i was lucky!) of loose-leaf tea and sitting there for more than 4 hours at a time getting caught up on work and enjoying the atmosphere. \n\nI love the kind of caf\u00e9 i can sit in for HOURS and be perfectly content just admiring the things they've got hanging (or painted) on the walls and ceilings and being delighted by the people I see walk through the door and sit for a spell. The ambience of the place garners five stars.-- very warm, welcoming, and spacious enough to make every visit a new experience depending on where you sit and what perspective of the place you take.\n\nSuper props for the hand-mosaicked tables, pochoir stencils on the walls, eccentrically skillful menu board illustrations (I can't wait to see what'll replace the witches stirring a cauldron for the winter...), ample supply of board games and books, varying types of seats (couches, chairs, high stools, regular old tables for two and four).\n\nThe tea menu also is quite good. However, at least three teas that I've attempted to order have been \"out\". This leads me to wonder how often these teas are actually replaced... I really want to try a few that sound delicious, but they never seem to be stocked.\n\nFinally, ONE negative point: I once bought a day-old muffin that tasted like reconstituted dog food. Since it was day-old, there was no label, so it might have catered to a certain dietary persuasion, but it was plain old bad. I threw it in my trash can at home and later found that my cat (who eats eeeeverything) had dragged the thing out onto the floor, hungrily ripped it apart, and ultimately poo-pooed it (meaning: left it lying on the floor, not \"poo-pooed\" in the literal sense...).\n\nActually, one more negative point: customer service does leave a little to be desired, depending on who's behind the counter. One night around 5pm I went in and ordered a Bike Shop Bagel, only to be sarcastically belittled as such (somewhat hyperbolically paraphrased): \n\n\"PSSHHHH BAGEL? Are you SERIOUS?! We ALWAYS run out of bagels. DUH. No one in their right mind tries to order a bagel after 4pm !!! What a LOSER! Have you even BEEN here before ?!\" \n\nNeedless to say, I was not thrilled, especially seeing as I had often ordered a Bike Shop Bagel after 5pm in the past, but I did consequentially realize that the Bike Shop Wrap (which I ended up ordering, when I should have just thrown my hot tea in the barista's face and stormed out) is also really good and gives you almost twice the innards as the bagel for only a buck more.\n\nDespite sometimes crappy customer service, the space itself --and its menu selections-- is wonderful, so I give the place five stars with the suggestion to make Satellite part of your repertoire... because maybe then the counter people won't be so sour/apathetic to you in the future :) !!\n\nSECRET TIP: Bike Shop Bagel on a Cinnamon Raisin is GO-O-OD! ! !

While I appreciate that Green Line tries to appeal to a community that leans toward organic options, what is the point of that when a coffee shop doesn't get their coffee right? On the other hand, their tea and their pumpkin spice latte (offered in the fall/winter) are pretty good. Their croissants are also good, especially if you get them early in the morning, when they've been freshly delivered. As for their sandwiches, I'd stay clear out of the way. I've had their sandwiches and burritos. They are barely edible and over-priced for packaged food. For a quick bite, I'd walk down two blocks to grab a freshly-made sandwich at Milk & Honey. \n\nThis location has shaded outdoor seating in the summer, overlooking Clark Park and the Farmer's market - a great place to hang out on a nice day.

Was over at the park across the street with my son and his friends, and felt the urge to use the restroom and wanted a drink.  Walked across the street and into the cafe.  Very small and quaint and it was moderately busy but not crazy busy.  Line of about 4 people in front of me.  Only one single person restroom so my son used the restroom while I waited in line.  Order an iced tea with flavored syrup which ended up being $5.  Crazy.  But visiting Philly and things are sometimes pricey so okay, fine.  Girl goes to make it and realizes that coffee is spilled because the coffee pot was not put in right so she sets my tea on the top of the coffee maker and goes to clean the spill, which is fine also.  I don't mind waiting.  Waited another 5 minutes, she cleaned the spill but was doing other orders.  Also fine, I can wait.  Had my son wait in my place next to the counter while I used the bathroom as it constantly had a line.  Came out of the restroom to find all three employees looking at him like he had three heads asking what he's waiting for.  He mentions the tea and the girl who made my tea said she made it and put it on the counter and someone must have taken it.  I hear this and explain that she made the tea and put it on the coffee maker, which confuses her.  I point to the coffee maker behind her and tell her she put it there, and she looks confused again before admitting that it could possibly be my tea.  I say, \"I saw you set it there when you were cleaning up the coffee that spilled\" and it finally dawns on her that it IS my tea, and she hands it to me with a \"let me know if I forgot the syrup\" to which I replied that I saw her put the syrup in and that it was fine.  I had to add another sugar as there was not enough syrup to sweeten the iced tea, and it was fine, but I make better brewed iced tea at home.  Had I not been paying attention to what this girl was doing or been on my phone or distracted I would not have seen her make the tea and would have been left with the excuse that someone had taken it.

Well I'm happy to announce that this donut finally has a dipping companion, and its name is: Milkboy (get it? Coffee and donuts...I thought it was clever).\n\nI knew, only by word of mouth, the awesomeness of the other two Milkboy Coffee locations. A coffee shop and music venue: how could you go wrong with that combination? My friend and I decided to stop here late last week to finally give it a try. I was feeling particularly sluggish after a long day at work, and thought some coffee would be the perfect pick-me-up. You can see before you even go inside what incredible potential this place has. The main entrance is on Chestnut Street, but they've actually converted the 11th Street side of the building into two huge garage-door style entrances where patrons are able to enjoy indoor/outdoor seating. When we entered there was a huge staircase in front of us, I can only imagine leading to the space that will eventually become the music venue (can't wait!). The downstairs space is actually somewhat limited, due largely to the fact that most of the room is occupied by the bar. Oh yea, did I mention this place serves alcohol?!\n\nWe decided to snag a seat at the bar, seeing as to get to the coffee register you have to walk all the way to the end of the room. Not sure if this was the best decision logistically, but I'm not complaining. Anyway, once we took our seat my attention quickly turned from that much-needed boost of caffeine to the cool intoxication of a beer. Their drink menu, while limited in size, had a nice selection of both draught and canned beers. Also, if you're looking to get loaded, they offer a Straub beer and shot of JD for a measly $6. Both my friend and I opted for a Wild Onion's Pumpkin Ale. I'd never heard of this craft brewery before, but it was arguably one of the best pumpkin beers I've tried. Wonderfully spiced and a great reminder that Fall's quickly approaching.\n\nI also decided to sample something from their (limited) food menu. There were a lot of burrito options, which seemed random, however, seeing as their kitchen only recently opened I'm sure over time their menu will expand along with their exposure. I decided to try the \"Pickled Veggie Tempura\" on the recommendation of our bartender. Lightly battered, house-pickled veggies served with buttermilk dipping sauce. Delicious. Check em out.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my first visit to Milkboy. I'm glad to see that all the time and red tape that was encountered while working to secure and convert this space has finally paid off.

I remember hearing from other friends that their Ardmore location had a TON of awesome vegan food on their menu and good coffee to boot.  I checked their menu for their Ardmore location and got really excited at the prospect of having a warm vegan breakfast (tofu scrambles and vegan scrapple, hell yes!) available to me on my way in to work.  With that being said, I spared no time in checking out the center city location for lunch.  \n\nWhen I got there, I was greeted by a waitress/barista and I asked if I can place a take out order, she handed me the menu and upon looking at it, was immediately disappointed in the vegan options, there are barely any!  No tofu, no tempeh bacon, no scrapple, no vegan cheese (daiya), just seitan and roasted veggies.  Not even any vegan baked goods!  Maybe it's just because they just opened and are just trying to figure out the kitchen before expanding their menu?  I don't know, but I ordered their seitan cheesesteak anyway (sans cheese, SO lame).  After waiting for almost 30 minutes (no exaggeration, literally 30 minutes!), I finally got my order and proceeded back to my office to dig into lunch.  I opened the container and seriously couldn't believe I just paid $9.72 for a 6 inch seitan cheesesteak.  Cut into half, I felt like I was eating a finger sandwich, not a cheesesteak.  That really sucked.  Coupled with the long wait time, the confusing ordering (I had to order my coffee and food separately), the fact that I heard the owner or manager yell at one of the employees, it was just NOT a good experience.  \n\nVegans, do yourself a favor and skip this place.  $10 for a kid-sized sandwich??  Ugh, I feel like I just got played.  And who knows if there is any cross-contamination going on the cooking surfaces.  Go to Blackbird, and get yourself a real sandwich that's double the size AND cheaper.

And then there were the drinks- I am pretty sure they served me a straight up glass of cranberry juice and even when I requested more vodka the bartender begrudgingly added half of a teaspoon. They also don't have the typical cocktail menu they have downstairs and pretty limited liquor options, served with a side of rude. \nDownstairs however, it's a totally different story. I really enjoy their imaginative cocktail menu and they always have some great beers on tap with an awesome bartender to boot. You can't go wrong with their coffee on a hungover Saturday morning either.

The taste (aside from the chicken) was just OK - nothing really there to bring the whole thing together. It was like someone literally thought this up by putting a salad, including croutons, excluding dressing, into a tortilla and calling it a dish.\n\nMy two theories about how this horrible wrap came to be are - either they took so long so that they could carefully overcook the chicken. Why else would it take so long to bring it to me? My other theory is that they wrote up the description before ever having made this, and mine was the first one, and it took a few practice runs before they got one that met the minimal standards to serve on a plate.\n\nEither way, I'm disappointed that I spent so much of my limited city-exploring time waiting for someone to overcook a bland meal.

My wife and I came by around 10am on a recent Sunday and it wasn't open yet.  I was a little disappointed, considering it's a bar that features coffee, so my first critique would be that they shouldn't wait until 11am to open.  The good news is that it's in a great location so there was plenty to do for the hour we had to wait.\n\nOnce there we were very impressed with the friendly staff, including the talkative bartender.  But it's the food that keeps me coming back.  They have a very good Breakfast Burrito here; in my opinion it is the best in the city.  My wife prefers the one at Cafe Lift and it's hard to argue with that.  But Milkboy has chopped seitan as a topping you can add and this takes it over the top for me.  Scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, jack cheese, potatoes (inside the burrito, not on the side like at Lift), scallions, and pinto beans round it out with a spicy green sauce for dipping.  I also love that this burrito is meant to be eaten with your hands!  They wrap it up in tinfoil and paper, and you can eat the burrito the way God intended, another plus over Lift's.\n\nMy wife ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Seitan Sandwich and she had a foodgasm.  I was so happy to see her smile like that.  She had been waiting a long time to find a sandwich to replace her favorite that they used to serve at the Belgian Cafe but removed from the menu, and she told me this one was absolutely it.  The seitan was crispy and smoky and amazing.  The bread was a french roll.  And it comes with a mushroom jus for dipping that really sells the sandwich.  Fantastic.  We both can't wait to go back and have it again.  Do yourself a favor and replace the American cheese with Gruyere - it changes the sandwich.  I hate American cheese and it seems like a cheap add-on to such a great meal, so substituting Gruyere was perfect.  Our waitress even complimented us on the choice and told us people should all be doing it.\n\n The cocktails are OK.  They could use some slight improvement before Milkboy gets a 5 out of 5.  Some are a little boring and need more creativity.  I am a fan of the City Wides (a variety of beers with various choices of shots).

His burger was so sloppy and greasy it couldn't be held. My chicken sandwich seemed as if they pre-fry a bunch at the beginning of the night and re-fry when ordered. It was so bartered and saturated in heavy grease, it turned my stomach. There was no silverware on our table and I couldn't find anyone to get me any so I waited at the bar until I found someone who gave them to me while rolling their eyes.

I had Troegs Mad Elf Ale while my boyfriend had the Longtrail ale. He switched it up to Slyfox and I ordered a Corona Light before happy hour ended.

So if you brought 20 people, you'd get paid a percentage of 20 people's covers, no matter where you stand in the line up.\n\nI'm also a little confused as to how they think 200 people can fit up there.

I knew I would have a problem when I learned that counter culture was their bean of choice...although I WANT badly to like fair trade brands, there has NEVER been one that I find to my liking. Dark is the bean that pleases the galester. I HATED both blends that were on tap; a house that was medium, described as a mocha Java, and a varietal (that will change daily) of El Salvador. They made me an americano, no extra charge, and they KNOW coffee, because like a hawk I watched her deftly manipulate the ones and twos like a DJ, producing a crema that was smile worthy. They will boast a full kitchen where veg and vegan options will abound, and look out for beer on 6 taps and a show lineup scheduled as they evolve into a 2 floor nightspot. Happy hour begins at 5, and although the price point is high, their quality is Top notch. It IS the first day though, so as they grow and I revisit, we will see how the updates fare.

They were extremely understanding of us being late to our reservation. We were immediately seated once we arrived and suggestions were made on what drinks to get. \n\nThe place is BYOB. We didn't know this so we were actually offered liquor on the house! I got the coconut chai lemonade with extra shots of vodka. It was mixed so well by Christian that I didn't even realize that I was drinking alcohol. \n\nFood (5 stars) \nEverything was just on point. And by that I mean the seasoning and presentation. We finished almost everything and by no means are the portion sizes small. It was that good. \n\nTo start we got the soup of the day and the crab cake. Let's just say I'll be dreaming about the crab cakes when I return to Chicago. Next we ordered the Ni\u00e7oise salad. The salmon was cooked to perfection, seriously, I am not over exaggerating. For entrees, I ordered the mussels and he got the seasonal flat iron steak with summer vegetables. Again, seasoning was perfect, not too salty and very palatable. I think there were over 40 mussels that came with my dish, which is something I've never seen before! \n\nService (5 stars) \nChristian and Kristin you both rock! Thank you for making our evening so memorable! The staff is extremely attentive and made every effort to make our experience as comfortable as possible. Empty plates and glasses were taken off of the table within 5 minutes. Plates and silverware were replenished after every course. I can honestly say that I've never had such a nice experience at such a low cost. Girard's is rare in that pleasant service is expected of the staff. Our bill came out with service included in the cost of each dish. I was so surprised because other restaurants that we have visited expect you to pay for service even if it is subpar. Let's just say I've never wanted to tip at a restaurant so badly. They definitely earned our gratitude. \n\nAll in all, there are so many great things to say about Girard's. If you are looking for a fantastic and intimate setting for your date, look no further than Girard's. \n\nP.S. I was so satisfied with the experience that I had to immediately write this review.

I am imagining them texting with that phone on the trolly right after holding the nasty rail.\n\nOther than hygiene however, I was impressed by the food. I wasn't blown away because it was trying to seem exotic but when you break down the dishes its kind of ordinary often inexpensive ingredients. The execution was on point though and they showed creativity in how the ingredients were paired. I liked the pistachio butter and banana sandwich the best. I was underwhelmed actually by the pistachio butter - i thought it would be more catchy - but the sandwich pulled it off by being fried and the bananas were fried too and there was a side of dipping syrup that was good. I also had the Quinoa for my main course and it was good but it couldve used more of the additives like poached egg or berries and less of the quinoa. My girlfriend had the eggs Benedict with salmon but it couldve used some pickled red onion on it.\n\nOverall a lot of just slightly missed marks.

The black and white ceiling was no substitute for decor.  Not a single flower.  So on to the food.  This is another BYOB (bring your own bread).  Nothing served with the soup.  A beet tartare for $9.50 consisted of at most a quarter of a diced beet.  The hamburger was tasty and accompanied with 12 waffle chips and a dollop of mustard for $16.  The desert choices were limited.  I was served a pear/apricot tart with burned crust.  A taste of the bread pudding made me savor the burned tart, it was that bad.

I kind of got a diner vibe once I walked in the restaurant, however, make no mistake, the food was far from diner quality.  We started with the tomato gazpacho (morr puree than creamy but certainly was filled with flavor).  I normally dislike puree soup but this was really good. I had the smoked duck benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side while my bf had the country style breakfast with bacon, charred grapefruit. Ok, so I was actually expecting a thicker piece of duck than sliced beef like duck. However, it was overall very good without being too salty which is normally the reason why I don't like smoked salmon on my benedict.  Glad I got to try the duck version benedict.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the hike fries which were a fusion of being a chip but filled with potato filling. \nWe ended our meal with the banana granola coffee cake, served warm and moist. No complaints there. The granola were toasty and crunchy, loved it. \nOh for our drinks. We had the ice cafe Brulee (I thought was a little disappointing because it tasted like a cold brew) and coconut Chai lemonade (one word, INTERESTING but not my cup of tea).

I know there's been a lot of resistance/annoyance at their claim that \"tipping not necessary\" and I suspect that's the biggest issue they need to deal with.  Im not against it, though I believe the way the public and press anticipated it and translated it, some of the public just got angry.  I suppose that's a typical reaction from being confused. People don't like to be confused and the hype over Girard was inflated before it even opened.  \n\nLet's stay focused on the most important thing of all: THE FOOD.  The food is GREAT.\nI've had a great lunch there in January with a friend.  We over ordered and treated ourselves to a great lunch/brunch feast.  The service was really good and the kitchen was super.  Our food was spectacular and we left with a smaller bill than expected.  We tipped a lil on top of our bill because our server went out of her way for us which enhanced our meal.  \n\nThen, last night, I stopped in with a friend as we were looking for a last minute dinner destination along Girard ave.  I am so glad we did.  Sadly, the place was mostly empty.  I like that the interior is fresh and original.  Thanks Girard, for not looking and acting like every other place Ive been too.  The server was friendly and attentive.  We started with the Avocado Toast to share.  I have to admit, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The heaping serving of smashed avocado had spring peas and mint mixed in with drizzles of honey.  I wasn't prepared for the level of pleasure that evoked.  I love getting an inventive surprise and this was exactly that.\n\nMy friend had the half chicken piri piri, which was really tasteful and came on a large plate of saute'd vegetables.  It was a LOT of food.  My main course was the coffee-rubbed hanger steak. It  was cooked in a wine reduction and placed onto a delicious layer of mashed potatoes that seemed to have the slightest hint of truffle.  Im not sure but the entire dish was incredibly full of layers of flavor.   We split a dessert and that too was amazingly good.  Over all we had a very enjoyable dinner and the server dispelled confusion by his friendly mention that the bill he brought included tip already so we \"can pretend we're in Paris\".  Honestly the bill was too low for the quality of our meal so we bumped what we each paid up to $40 so that there was another 10-12% tip.  We did that so willingly because the food was just about perfect. In fact, the food was so good we had to double check the bill for a mistake because it was a lot lower than expected.  We often pay as much for less inventive food at gastropubs. \n\nI hope that the area continues to support them because this is a gem for the neighborhood and the city.  \n\nI'll be back.", "date": "2015-04-23 13:51:23", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 248, "average_stars": 3.85, "yelping_since": "2008-05-08 20:14:06"}}

After a few minutes driving around I was able to find street parking close to the restaurant. The space is open and clean, with yellow washed wood walls, wood floors and wood tables and white chairs. The ceiling has this funky white and black pattern.  The kitchen is open also and the place is not huge but still has a decent amount of tables. There was also some outdoor seating.\n\nThe service was outstanding. They were helpful with suggestions and always right there to fill water or if we needed anything else. They really seemed to appreciate their customers. GB&B also follows the European concept, that their staff is paid a fair wage so the prices include a 15% tip. It is also a BYOB restaurant.\n\nWe started with the Avocado Toast. This was really good with a combination of ingredients (chipotle honey, mascarpone cheese and grapefruit) that really worked well together.\n\nFor our main courses we had the Char-Grilled Piri Piri Chicken, the Brasserie Burger and P.B.C. Commonwealth Dry Cider Maine Muscles. The nice thing about eating as a small family, we all share each other's food and in that way we get to taste everything. The Piri Piri Chicken was a winning dish. The Piri Piri sauce was full of flavors without being overly spice. The chicken was crispy and moist and the side salad was also very good. The burger was outstanding, one of the better burgers we have had. I wasn't too sure about the English muffin but it worked well with the Gouda cheese and bacon jam. The burger was juicy without the muffin being soggy either. The Muscles were also a good dish and the sauce was with bacon, garlic, herbs and sea salt had us asking for more bread for dipping.\n\nFor dessert we had two very nice items, a lemon poppy seed pound cake with berries and a blackberry tart. Both were excellent and not overly sweet. Girard Brasserie also serves French press coffee.\n\nWe were about $30.00 per which includes the 15% service charge.

Taste and texture are from the hands of neighbors. \n\nThey have a fair wage policy for all employees. That means everyone earns a reasonable living income ($14./hr now). This encourages long term commitment from workers and ownership, and shows great respect for people. As a result a 20 % tip is included in every check. Nothing more required unless you feel it warranted. Yes, this makes it difficult to express dissatisfaction with service or food quality through tipping, but on balance there is far more good from this approach, than negative. \n\nTheir Elixr Coffee is hot and strong. Cold brew is also available at a small premium. In exchange for their smallish cups, refills are attentively prompt. In truth, the tables are smallish, too, so saving space makes sense. \n\nThe room itself is tight, but brightly yellow. An odd angled ceiling helps with acoustics and gives a slight unreality to the space. Big windows overlook Fishtown, a corner of Philly undergoing a distinct renaissance. \n\nFinally, our breakfast ( I don't do brunch ) was excellent. The Breakfast Burger was a double patty, thick bacon and sunnyside up egg on brioche bun that was juicy and fun. The side of fries was crisp and plentiful. Their homemade hot sauce, a kick in the pants when poured on generously. We shared a square of their peach/basil coffee cake. Both ingredients were easily palatable, and to our delight, it was not overly sweet, but allowed to make it's own quiet statement. Delicious. \n\nGirard checked all the boxes that matter, and a few not normally considered. \n\nImpressive!", "date": "2017-07-09 20:23:52", "useful": 18, "funny": 5, "cool": 10, "user": {"review_count": 3131, "average_stars": 3.68, "yelping_since": "2012-12-16 23:26:39"}}

Perhaps being from NYC I'm a little jaded on the brunch frontier (even though I don't really brunch lol), but this place was just ok to me.\n\nWe arrived to a line, but you are unable to put your name down - you just kind of stand behind the person in front of you and wait. The way they seat people is also just off. I understand wanting to seat 4 people at a table of 4, but it seems counterproductive to have 3 sets of 2 people just wait and wait while staring at an empty table for over 30 minutes. To add insult to injury, a 4 person group just happens into the place and they are seated right away. By the way, the table I speak of is able to be separated into 2 tables of 2.\n\nFinally after waiting way too long, we are seated at the counter area. I ended up getting the biscuit and with gravy which was good, but very salty (i love salt) and small. My husband got pancakes and something I can't remember and it was fine also. I also got a fresh squeezed orange juice which was very good, but at $4 for my baby cup, it felt like a rip-off. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't anything wow. Having faced the kitchen the whole time, we saw that the workers back there were overworked - it was nonstop orders coming in and they looked exhausted. Seemed like a family run business, but they also didn't seem to care if you left due to their backwards seating system because no one really acknowledged you unless you are first in line and standing there for at least 10 minutes.\n\nI wouldn't need to come back here.\n\nP.S. They also had something called #onefairwage where they automatically charge 20% gratuity to the checks \"in order to provide our hard working employees a guaranteed living wage.\" EXCUSE ME, as an owner, they should be the one responsible for paying a fair wage for their workers to live. I thought it was ridiculous that they are only \"guaranteed a living wage\" from forcing their patrons to pay.

I've never had it before, but it's what the craze is all about now, and don't know whether it's a blessing or a curse that I had it here (it was awesome!).\n\nVisiting a good friend all weekend, we were lucky to try so many good restaurants and this was one of the most pleasant experiences I've had in a long time.  Even looking at other people's review, I can tell that this place has consistency.  We walked into this bright restaurant on Saturday late morning for brunch.  I still had my coffee from La Colombe so I politely asked our host/waiter if it was OK for me to bring it in (and if not, that's completely fine and I'll throw it out).  He was taken aback that I asked because he told me nobody has ever asked him and that it was definitely OK for me to bring it in.  He was an extremely nice guy!\n\nWe split a couple of small dishes, such as the aforementioned avocado toast and the pistachio-butter & banana sandwich.  The avocado toast was amazing - granted, I've never had it before, but it was on this pumpernickel bread and all the flavors worked magically together.  I'm typically not a fan of pumpernickel bread, but with the thick avocado (picture guac, but more \"spreadable\") and the additional toppings, it all worked really well.  In addition to the avocado, there was pickled asparagus, goat cheese, and some radish slices.  The pistachio-butter & banana sandwich was tasty, but really sweet.  Granted, we all put syrup on it because that's how you're supposed to eat it, but the syrup added a whole other layer of sweetness that it didn't necessarily need, but it was still sweet and moist.\n\nI ordered the country-style breakfast as my main brunch entree and it was really good.  I got scrambled eggs, which were seasoned perfectly, and their home fries are thinly-sliced potatoes the size of quarters, and they were great.  The biscuit was a bit dry, but warm and tasty.  The charred grapefruit was interesting - definitely a cool concept and great in theory, but I'm just not a fan of grapefruit.\n\nOverall, an awesome place in the neighborhood and I definitely want to check them out for dinner sometime...one of the best brunches I've had, hands down.", "date": "2015-06-30 02:22:58", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 389, "average_stars": 3.73, "yelping_since": "2010-09-17 17:24:01"}}

We were greeted at a side door and sat immediately. Although our server was a little but awkward, he was kind and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time. \nWe started with two cappuccinos that were decent, but small. \nWe then each got a sandwich, mine was a croque madam and he got a burger. The food took over 20 minutes to be cooked and we were the only people in the restaurant. When I got my sandwich, I took a bit and the inside was cold. At first I thought that maybe it was supposed to be cold, but after asking our server, he informed us it was to be warm. They took it and back and reheated the same sandwich. 10 minutes later I get my heated up sandwich and it was just OK. No bad, not good, just forgettable. \nMy boyfriend asked for his burger medium rare, but it came out well done. He was hungry and decided to eat it anyways, saying the bun it was on was good but the rest was just meh. \nWe paid with a credit card and saw there was no line on the credit card slip to leave an additional tip. I work in the restaurant industry and DO NOT think $12/hr is a good, livable wage.

A great concept for a restaurant in this generation--no tipping required. I love the idea that the owners are giving their staff a living wage and benefits to boot. (Tip anyway! Everything is great!)\n\nI visited with a party of three others on Girard's second night open--11/22/14. The entire place was running like a well-oiled machine, which can be suprising for a place that just opened. \n\nThe only hiccup of our visit was that there seemed to be some kind of misunderstanding for my friends order with the waitress... But I have to chalk it up to it being the restaurants second day.\n\nI ordered a prixe fix meal because it was a great deal-- App, meal, dessert for fair price. I had celery soup to start--the flavor was amazing and not what I was expecting. It tasted like amazing thanksgiving day stuffing somehow. There was not a drop left in my bowl. I had the roast beef as my main--very tender--and the horseradish sauce was amazing. For dessert I had the chocolate tart. It was very good! But if you're not a huge fan of chocolate, I would either share it or get a different dessert as its one of those chocolate desserts that leaves you full after a few spoonfuls.\n\nThe rest of my party savored and  enjoyed their food as well. We all tried  a little of each other's. The avocado toast was sooo good! The flavors are so tasty--it was even a little spicy. The burger was amazing and the potatoes are so so good! I've been craving the burger and potatoes since we've been there. The philly muffin the burger comes on is so nice and crusty. I also tried my wife's pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was amazing. It was smooth and light. We all also shared a charcuterie plate--amazing!!\n\nI can't wait to return to try their breakfast foods--they're served all day! \n\nThe atmosphere was lovely: the decor is modern--I like the yellow and black color palette. The space is cozy, but you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other diners--which I hate. The vibe is chill, but fancy. The staff is knowledgable, friendly, and attentive.

It's a different world - like something out of Portland. Take a moment to eye the merch as you pass through the store.\n\nYou order from a counter, and if you're only having coffee and pastries then it's completely self serve. The coffee, served up in mugs, was quite good. We split a large croissant to nibble on while waiting for our hot meals. The croissant was quite good as well, crusty/flaky if rustic in appearance and not exactly authentically French.\n\nHaving gone two for two on our first two choices we eagerly awaited our meals. The grit cakes with bison sausage was the  winning dish. Perfectly cooked sunny side eggs, tasty cakes, and juicy, flavorful sausage. I probably should have changed my order when the counter-person told me I could not have sunny side up eggs with the salmon/bacon hash - the eggs would come scrambled in. This dish did not work for me. Had the eggs been separate, the hash - potato chunks, plentiful salmon, bacon, onion and scallion would have been divine under a runny egg yolk.  Mixed with egg, the hash could not develop crusty goodness. The  were overcooked, under-seasoned and made the whole dish a little bland. Adding salt, pepper and hot sauce after is not the same as cooking the seasonings into the eggs. The sourdough toast that accompanied the hash was near perfection, fresh, lightly buttered, toasted just enough.  Maybe if I come back and ask nicely, I can get fried eggs on top of hash the way it should be. UBB, please reconsider this dish.\n\nI would certainly return.

I didn't realize they bottled it on premise. The person at the counter informed me that it was brewed and bottled within 20 hours or so. I was under the impression that it was stale if the product didn't move. The price was a tad high, $4, but its probably due to the bottle itself. I did enjoy the taste of the cold brew, but it didn't have a lot of bold flavors. I browsed around the store a bit and they had some really nice boutique'ish things.

We've never been here before and there are no signs designating whether you should order in one area and pick your food up in another. So we actually ended up going into the order line backwards and that's why we didn't see the weekend special sign that was hanging up.

She continues to ask me if \"I'm sure\" because that's \"a lot of coffee.\" My friend overhears and asks me, \"Did that barista just shame you about how much coffee you want?\" At least the muffin was good. \n\nVisit 2: I order a small iced mocha (for here) and a (vegan) Raspberry Almond Oat muffin. The barista tells me they're out of chocolate, so I change my order to a small iced chai. The barista hands me a tall glass. He didn't even bother to stir the chai concentrate and the milk together. There is milk dripping down the side of the glass. All I taste is milk and licorice. The muffin was barely edible. Super gummy like someone (unsuccessfully) tried to compress a soggy bowl of granola into bread form. Never again. \n\nVisit 3: This was the day after Visit 2. I tried again to order a small iced mocha, but (a different) barista said they were still out of chocolate. I get a small iced coffee (for here) and a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Muffin. The coffee was a million times better than the chai, but there was no simple syrup. The \"egg\" on the muffin looked like tofu and the bacon was \"ham\" without a lot of flavor.

I wish that they'd just not offer wireless--it's like, don't serve a dish if you don't know how to cook it so that it's at least palatable.  If the wireless were a dish of food, it would be something that I had to throw out half the time, because it just doesn't work half the time.  I love community-based coffee shops that aren't just a bunch of people plugging away on their laptops, so I would support the idea of this place going without wifi.  I just resent it being advertised as wifi, and me planning coming here to use the internet, only to find I can't use it at all.\n\nI like the ambiance here.  This place is on a corner, on a slight hill, placing the seating a bit below the level of the street.  This, combined with the big glass windows, gives you the odd but somewhat cool effect of looking up and out into the neighborhood, which is a quirky hodgepodge of nicely kept and more run-down buildings, always populated by interesting people.\n\nThis place serves good baked goods, and good tea, which is what I drink.  The tea is actually from the company Divinitea, and is pretty good; I have begun reviewing some of it, and you can find the reviews (or write your own if you so desire) on my interactive tea rating site:\n\nhttp://ratetea.net/brand/divinitea/248/\n\nSome of the employees here have been nice.  Some of them have seemed cold and detached, or snippy at times though.  I used to frequent Cafe Clave, and I wouldn't exactly call the employees warm and fuzzy people there, but I found them to be friendly on a deep level.  I never got like, a genuinely uncomfortable vibe from them.  Sometimes I have gotten the vibe here that the people seem irritated with me or with other customers, for some unknown reason--I've never seen a customer being difficult.  I don't know if there's something about the way they set up the shifts that causes the employees to become too stressed or what...but the employees here often seem run down or snippy.  I have noticed, what other people remark, about them sometimes being over-eager to kick people out before closing time--maybe it's juts giving a heads up so people have time to wrap up, but it sometimes seems a bit abrasive.  It's not what they say, it's how they say it.\n\nOne time I lost my temper at an employee here.  I'm not proud of it and it's more my issue than his, but I still think the way he was acting towards me was disrespectful; I had a not-particularly-important remark about the soap in the restroom, and I approached him about it and was very respectful and positive about how I brought it up with him, but he kept persistently interrupting me telling me he didn't have any control over it, without even hearing what I had to say.  It just seemed really rude because in like, 99% of my other interactions I've had in life in other businesses, when I've brought up a concern, people have at least listened to what I had to say, and they usually acknowledge it or say they'll say something to a manager instead of interrupting me and saying that I need to contact the management about it on my own.  I know others don't always have the same social norms for interactions, but I personally am very hesitant to interrupt a customer offering a suggestion or complaint, and the way the employee interacted with me struck me as dismissive and abrasive, and really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nThe music is eclectic...some days I love it, other times I'm a little less excited...but it's never generic.\n\nThe wireless here is notoriously unreliable.  Some days it works fine, most days it is spotty, sometimes it doesn't work at all.  I don't know what their issue is...the signal strength is strong.  I think their router can't handle the volume of traffic in the store, personally.  But that's not my issue to work out--it's theirs--and it already hurts their business because I don't come here as often as I otherwise would.\n\nIf it weren't for the spotty wireless and my awkward interactions with some of the employees, this would probably be my favorite coffee shop not only in West Philly, possibly in all of Philadelphia.  As-is, I usually only come here to hang out, or for a break, usually if other people suggest to come here, but I don't ever come here if I actually need internet.", "date": "2011-09-08 17:01:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 629, "average_stars": 3.88, "yelping_since": "2007-05-03 21:52:54"}}

When you order a bagel with cream cheese, you receive a (barely toasted) Lenders-esque bagel, a pod of cream cheese, and a knife.  IMHO, to be a good cafe, your cream cheese should come out of a vat. Less wasted plastic pods, more cream cheese on my bagel, minimal extra work for baristas. Third issue. Cash only, and their ATM is often broken.

This is based on several times I have been here and my patience is beginning to wear thin. I never even write Yelp reviews and it's gotten SO bad, I just had to let you know...The servers are inattentive (I waited 12 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we wanted our order taken), they never refill our waters (I ALWAYS have to ask and ask... and ask...), they never get the order correct (any time there is a modification or god forbid, dressing on the side... it's wrong)... they never bring the soup out on time (since when did we finish a meal with soup?)... they're just all around... bad. Get a manager in there to train or a head server to whip them into shape -- even just teach them what it takes to have good service and hustle.  Your food is saving your restaurant and I've been coming here for a while -- the place looks great too. Don't let it go down in flames because of a couple bad eggs. Not everyone is meant to be in the service industry... get them out of there and give your customers what we deserve, people who know what they're doing.", "date": "2016-11-03 22:40:48", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 5, "average_stars": 3.2, "yelping_since": "2014-05-02 22:56:00"}}

The soup of the day with chicken and rice was stellar (I ended up trading the BF for this because I was so obsessed). \n\nMy beet goat cheese sandwich was very very tasty. Awesome balance of fresh arugula and savory ingredients. I have a thing against toasted whole grain bread that scratches up my sensitive gums though so I probably won't get this again. \n\nBF's burrata BLT was to die for.. soo good. Extremely awesome marriage of ingredients and the bread was perfectly toasted. Was tempted to \"trade\" the BF for this too but I was feeling generous and settled for a few stolen bites instead ;)\n\nWaitress forgot our cucumber lemonade and was a bit slow having to work the front restaurant by herself while picking up the phone etc so nothing personal there, and we were super full and satisfied anyway.

It is totally comfort filling food. \n\nWe obviously went with a soup, since they are supposed to be one of the best in Philly at soup. Both of us had Tomato Basil. \nIt is unlike any soup I have had before. It was delicious. Clearly it is home made as it had little chunks in it. You had sweetness from the tomato and basil flavor. I swear a cheese flavor in it as well. \nWe both did soup and a sandwich and I thought the bowl would be small, it was not. At first I thought they must have something wrong, but they did not. \nI also had a cucumber lemonade that was outstanding. You could taste both and it fit with the wholesome meal. \nNow on to the sandwich portion of the meal. My son went the obvious grilled cheese. When he pulled the halved sandwich apart the cheese just strung out in a large quantity. This was to my sons absolute glee, he gained a large smile at seeing the stringy cheese. They are generous with the cheese, I swear it was a half inch of the goodness between the bread. I had a taste of the grilled cheese, I ate half to be exact. It was delicious. The bread was fabulous and likely home made. \nMy sandwich I had a half meatball sandwich. It was delicious and my only wish was that I ordered a whole sandwich and not a half. It was earthy and homey, a true comfort type of food. \nI really loved the place and want to go back. The place is spacious and bright. The walls could use some cleaning, but that is about it. \nTo finish it off, my son really wanted dessert and we got the bill before they asked. So we ordered a cookie on the way out as we paid at the cashier. I'm not sure she charged us for it. When I pointed it out, the hostess waved us on and said it is not a big deal. She thought she had.

Today my husband and I finally made it out, and it was DE.LISH!\n\nWe went around noon, and it was difficult for me to decide if I wanted to go the breakfast or the lunch route...so I took a different path: dessert! I got the brownie batter waffle, which is exactly what it sounds like, served with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and fudge. It was mind blowing. Seriously. The waffle was so soft and not at all like I imagined the texture to be. I thought it'd be a lot \"heavier\" but it really wasn't. This dish could get you into trouble...\n\nMy husband went the lunch route. He got the soup and \"half\" a sandwich. The soup was sausage and bean, which was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of heat to it. He ordered the meatloaf sandwich, and as soon as he saw it he said, \"THAT'S A HALF A SANDWICH!?\" It was definitely enough to fill you up. The sandwich came with cheese and bacon, but the real highlight was, of course, the meatloaf. It was soooo juicy and definitely not like your mother's meatloaf.\n\nWe also had to get a side of macaroni and cheese, because I read on here that it was a winner. Whoever wrote that review was right. The gruyere cheese was the perfect choice - and I like that they're not shy with the pepper.\n\nAnother highlight: the cucumber lemonade. It takes a lot of sweat to churn out one of these bad boys, but I thank the staff for doing so, because it was SUPER refreshing. Don't worry, the lemon doesn't get lost with the cucumber, it only gets enhanced. I'm going to have to get that drink again.\n\nThings I want to try: their house breakfast sandwich. I can't remember exactly what's in it, but I know for certain that it includes asparagus and some type of meat that resembled prosciutto. It looked great, and I think it's served on an everything bagel (my favorite). Also: the chai milkshake. Need I say more about why I want to try that?\n\nAnyway, this place is a gem. The inside is really comfortable and has a lot more seating than you'd expect from looking at it outside. The prices are definitely reasonable and the food is quite creative.

The outside is kind of unassuming so I approached the establishment with apprehension not knowing what to expect from a place called \"Soup Kitchen\". Well it's fair to say I was pleasantly surprised. \nThe interior is small but you never feel cramped. Instead I think it creates a certain intimacy between you and the \"kitchen\". I put kitchen in quotes because from what I could see the kitchen of the Soup Kitchen is about the size of a closet. But luckily size doesn't matter for everything because the food pumped out of that closet was delicious imo. \nMaybe a large kitchen is not needed since the menu here is not that expansive. I was able to sample pretty much everything on the menu in one dining. My favorite dishes here are the mac and cheese, meat loaf and the pulled pork sandwiches. I also had the chicken salad sandwich, which had a nice twist to it as it had something with a crouton type consistency in it , and the crab cakes. The stand out dish was certainly the pulled pork which I hear is nominated for best in philly. Topped with sliced apples the pulled pork packs a light kick courtesy of the jalapeno sauce. Apples? Jalapeno dressing? Pork? I know what you're thinking.....Trust me it works. Every bite was moist, juicy and delicious. Also i'm not sure what it means but the pork tasted very \"fresh\" , like \"porky\" but not in a gamey sense...... if that makes sense. Every element of the sandwich just clicked together   perfectly imo. \nThis place is probably not on a lot of radars but it should be. I rate it a good 4 out of 5 with the only knock being the limited selection and the ikea like plastic chairs they have at the tables for two (they also have leather seats that look comfortable to be fair).

We were promptly greeted and brought waters but when it came to ordering the waitress took my friends food orders and proceeded to walk away. I let her know I would also like to order food. So she asks what I want and walks away as I'm ordering. She starts talking to a guy behind her she obviously knows and eventually turns back around after catching up with her buddy and proceeds to take the rest of my order.

I return to my seat and she comes over to tell me she \"forgot to put it in.\" The sandwich comes out after a few minutes and I eat it quickly because I was starving and we were pretty pressed for time. 20 minutes later and she hasn't come back over, We're sitting at the table with empty glasses and dirty plates and money on the table.

We walked around a full hour more, and after 11pm restaurants were definitely done.  Sulking and annoyed with each other, we headed back to our hotel with empty bellies.  We decided to walk up a street that we hadn't yet been on, and came across Tria.\n\nA server was bringing food out to the one outdoor table, and I was so hungry and cranky I think I just blurted out to my husband as I grabbed his arm \"this is a cheese restaurant and they are still serving and we are eating here!\"  Later we couldn't actually figure out what made me call it a cheese restaurant - they must just do a good job of conveying what they're all about.  We walked in and they were indeed still serving, and thank god there were exactly two seats remaining at their bar (still a half-hour wait for a table, despite being after 11pm).\n\nSo I already felt a love for this place because I was so hungry and I was ever thankful that I could get a decent plate of food at 11:30 at night.  But beyond this simple appreciation, everything was great.  Cured meats + salty cheeses + great  wine + shortbread cookies = yum.  This kind of meal is just my thing, and perfect for a late night nosh.\n\nAnd the service kicked ass - god it made me wish that the local tapas place in my hometown could trade staff with Tria!  We were greeted enthusiastically at the door and put on the wait list.  We stood at the only empty space at the bar for a few moments and someone nearly instantly appeared with bar stools for us.  Menus and waters came quickly, and we placed our drink orders.  I got my wine right away, and in what only seemed like a few minutes later, my husband got his coffee and was informed that it was on the house because it took so long.  Just as I was about to get up to inform the host that she could take us off the wait list because we were comfy at the bar, she came up to us to ask if we still would like a table.  Even though the place was beyond packed, food came out fast and the bartender was perfectly attentive.  Everyone was just totally in synch and the service was seemless.  \n\nIt's funny how sometimes it's easy to not notice when everything clicks - things that go wrong stand out so much more.  But this was one of those meals that at the end of the night you realize it was excellent in its subtle delivery of everything you wanted.

The place was packed (which it was every time we had walked by during our stay).  Which is great for them, and must be a sign of it's popularity.  We somehow got a seat inside by a window, which was lovely.  The lady that sat us was very friendly and gave us the run down, since it was our first time there.  Our waitress came over to us and really was not pleasant.  I am ALWAYS friendly to everyone that works in a restaurant/bar, so her not being pleasant is really uncalled for, but perhaps that is just her personality.  We were very thirsty from walking around the last two days, so we ordered a glass of wine each and asked for water.

It was incredibly rich and I probably could have split it, but I didn't mind having all to myself! The mascarpone was a nice addition to tone down the espresso cake.\n\nMy only complaint is the service. The server and bus staff were very knowledgeable about the menu items and provided excellent recommendations. However, our server checked on other tables for frequently than ours.

I guess 2 or 3pm something on a Saturday afternoon is dinner/evening preparation time. Fortunately, other than being easily distract-able from ADD, there were no negative implications of the lettuce jungle on my experience. \n\nThe drink menu is diverse. My companion went with a wine, I a beer to start. \n\nI was actually starving but didn't want to get crazy with it off the bat. I did however notice many delicious food offerings make their way from the kitchen to other tables. My salivary glands rumbled noticeably. \n\nEventually my appetite overcame me, oozing out of very orifice. I glanced over to the menu. Ho-boy. Just wait until you check out what they're offering up in this place. \n\nAfter thorough deliberation because it's very hard to choose with all of the mouth watering choices, I made my selection. I wanted something hard in the mouth and crisp on the tongue. Fortunately they have a vasy array of bruschetta. I went with the pistachio herbed ricotta bruschetta (w/ lavender honey) for $5.5 over the goat cheese pesto $5.5 at the suggestion of the waitress. Dining companion ordered warm poached black mission figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto for $7.5. \n\nPS- after initial submission of this review I realized aside from talking about myself and what I ordered, I never described the actual food. It was DELICIOUS. The ricotta was smooth and flavorful. Bread crisp and hard on the tongue. \n\nI did observe some really good looking shit with chips I couldn't figure out what it was from the menu.

We also went with the FAMOUS and CLASSIC truffled egg toast. I'm not particularly keen on salmonella in liquid form but this was delicious. I barely even noticed the yolk. Bread was the perfect lecture, cheese added a nice flavor, and the yolk seeped in just enough without causing too much of a sog. \n\nWe also ordered one of the cheeses, something that started with an e and I chose it particularly because it was difficult to pronounce.

Sometimes you want to experience an upscale vibe but nothing flashy. You're not trying to be difficult, it's just how you feel. For those nights, Tria is just the scene you might be looking for. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I went to Tria late at night; from a few other reviews it sounds like it gets pretty crowded around dinner, so the atmosphere is probably different depending on the hour. However, I thought the place was perfect for a chill night, when you just want to relax with a friend over some drinks and hors d'oeuvres. The ambience is dark, very pseudo-candlelight. I don't remember the music being so loud as to compete with conversation, but it was loud enough to have your attention. They played generally inoffensive stuff like \"High and Dry.\" \n\nI went with a friend after a concert, and it was the perfect place to unwind when the main event is over, but you're not ready to call it a night. Everything felt very clean and sleek, albeit a bit tight on space - very Montmartre. I can't imagine coming here with a party greater than four without feeling like you're hijacking the whole place. One thing I liked, was that its minimalism and low-key vibe make it a viable hangout spot for pretty much anyone of a legal drinking age, unlike most bars. I could just as easily picture a twenty-something hipster there as I could a retired wino. The website says, in regards to the unpretentious dress code, \"come as you are.\" That precious bit of philosophizing aside, I would still say there is a baseline dressiness; I mean, you are drinking wine. Even if you drink beer, let's be real: it's not going to be Miller High Life.\n\nAs for the victuals, our server gave us pairing suggestions based on the general flavor we were going for. Revealing ourselves to be the ignorant gourmands we are, we took both her suggestions point blank. It's fun how the menu groups together different types of wines and cheeses into categories like \"Stoic,\" \"Approachable\" and \"Smooth,\" such that ordering feels like an exercise in self-assessment. I got a Lighthearted red wine (the Dolcetto) and a Luscious cheese (the Nettle). My friend ordered a Bold red and a Racy blue cheese. I would say our choices reflected our personalities relatively well haha :)\n\nThe cheese comes with small slices of bread, as well as a complementary (and complimentary) spread of some kind. The Nettle came with a blueberry compote and the blue cheese with dried apricots. It was quite delicious! I would definitely come back again on one of those special nights where you're not really feeling here nor there. Come with a close friend or two who can appreciate understated sophistication... Tria is not the type of bar that will make your night fun by virtue of just being there; rather, it's the type of place that can provide a stylish backdrop for good conversation and good company.", "date": "2010-01-18 02:08:16", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 89, "average_stars": 4.29, "yelping_since": "2009-06-30 06:06:07"}}

The restaurant is small and they don't take reservations, but we figured we wouldn't have any trouble getting a seat for an early dinner on a rainy Tuesday. Wrong! The place was packed and noisy. We added our names to a list and waited around in the vestibule for a little while before moving to a bar seat where drinks were ordered, and then finally getting a table. Luckily, this gave us plenty of time to examine the menu, so we knew exactly what we wanted to order.\n\nWe decided to get a bunch of small plates, and then of course a cheese board. For himself, my husband picked spicy crab-stuffed peppers and a lamb sausage with white beans, peppers, and mint-feta sauce. (I don't really do lamb or sausage, but tried the beans and peppers with the mint sauce, it was very good!) For myself, I chose roasted beets with feta and pistachio herbed ricotta bruschetta with lavender honey - both were awesome. And then I made a kind of last-minute decision and also ordered us the truffled egg toast with fontina fontal, just because it sounded interesting. It was amazing, and I'm seeing after the fact that just about every review here seems to rave about it, so good choice!\n\nThen they brought out our cheeses, and at that point I was beginning to think maybe we'd made a bad decision in ordering so much food. If we go there again, I would probably do one fewer small plate and/or one fewer cheese. But we ended up with four cheeses, which they paired with four different condiments: a brie paired with a truffle paste, Reisling-Washed Sawmill Sleeper with Alagash-soaked cherries (this combo was especially amazing), a gouda with beet jelly,  and Montgomery's Cheddar with apricot honey. As we learned at Cheese 101, Tria's cheese prices are maybe a little high, but you get a much bigger portion than you do on most other cheese boards. So big that, for once, I did not finish all my cheese!\n\nOverall, I was really impressed with the food and the service was great, but I took away one star for the ambiance - crowded and very loud (not just the people, but the music).

I have spent many a nites and many a paychecks...and it has always been worth it. \n\nI came to Tria a few summers ago the first time, it was a long long evening and ended with last call. With among the last beers my brother & I had we decided to get some cheese which came with ultra ultra tasty honey. On asking our chirpy waitress (how she had a bounce in her step and energy in her voice at the end of a Saturday is beyond me) where that honey came from she asked us to write the question and told us Jon will get back to us. Sure enough the next  morning I got an e-mail from Jon (with my correct first name-a big effort) giving details on the honey. Also since the honey was sold in 5 gallon jars from a beekeepers house in Flourtown, PA he offered to sell a smaller quantity. I showed up at Tria the next evening and walked out with a pint glass filled with honey & covered with saran wrap (it looks suspiciously like beer on the street :-o). Long story to illustrate the wonderful service.\n\nTria sells Wine, Beer and Cheese. In addition it sells simple snacks such as sandwiches. The beer selection  on tap (and in bottles) is outstanding, they do tend to have a couple of local beers on tap, apart from Allagash white & Dogfish head.  If you are around here Christmas time I would highly recommend the Saison Dupont Christmas Ale (Avec Les Bons Vaeux de la Brasserie Dupont). In the wines I would recommend the Vouvray, it is a spectacular  wine from 89. (If you are in a group skip the glasses and get the bottle, really reasonably priced). I liked the way the menus are organized (Food, Cheese, Wine, Beer). The tria are organized according to taste, for instance zippy whites. The food is delicious, even simple things like the white bean spread are really good.  \n\nThe cafe itself is rather long with some tables in the front and along the walls. There is some outside seating in good weather months. I preferred sitting inside if I could get a place. This is not a place for huge groups, best as an intimate setting. To give some history on this place, it used to be the Alaska ice cream place before it became tria, so think ice cream place converted to bar, how large could it be. That said the interiors are spectacularly done and this place could hands down compete with one of those places from New York. \n\nA newer 'branch' of Tria has opened on 12th & Spruce, it can fit a larger group. I went there as a party of 8 last summer and they were able to seat us upstairs. While I like the original Tria, the newer Tria has a bit more space and the windows can be opened to the street so has a bit more Bistro like feel to it.

This place is straight up and cozy enough to enjoy a couple of small plates while sipping on a local brew on tap or one of their many selections of outstanding wines.\n\nObviously, the decision was made through searching Yelp and it lead me straight to Tria from the hotel...while searching for a place to hang and grab a bite with the wife.\n\nAs we walked in on a Sunday evening, the place was packed with locals and there was a 25 min. wait for a table.  But luckily, as we were suggested to take a walk towards the back bar area, we encounter two empty stools right in front where the cheese and small plates are prepared.  \n\nWe were quickly handed a printed menu with several pages clipped to a clipboard.  The first thing that catches my attention is Tria's \"Sunday School.\"  What is this, you may ask?  Every Sunday, Tria offers a cheese, wine, and beer for half off or slightly more and this is what they have to say: \n\n\"Learn about and enjoy a different not-so-common wine, cheese and beer every Sunday--at incredibly low prices. School was never this delicious! Limit one each per guest at the Sunday School price. Please, no returns: if you try it, you buy it. \n\nSo of course, I decide, why not...one of each!  The menu describes everything to the 'T.'  It lets you know the flavor characteristics, the region it came from...you get the drift.  \n\nThey have a great selection of local craft brews on tap that fits every beer drinkers palate.  From hoppy to light....\n\nWine selection is nifty too!  Anything from bubbly, to sweet, to dry, smooth and classy...\n\nTria offers you something to pair with everything.  It is a great place to get the night started or maybe even end.  That's because Tria really does not have a closing time.  They pretty much judge by the crowd, that's why they post their times as 'til ''Late Night.\"\n\nI had several cheeses that I kept slathering on the bread and the sliced italian meats board is wonderfully paired with several spreads...course mustard, pickled pimentos, garlic...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tria-philadelphia?select=moq-0wMPqeAeC5d1lS6Wkg#XL_eTp5E4E41DUMLvPL2iA\n\nThe next evening I just had to grab another drink and bite at Tria.  I walked in late in the evening and grabbed a glass of wine and ordered the Claudio mozarella sandwich w/ crispy prosciutto.  Imagine Caprese salad, with pesto, arugula, pimento and a mound of crispy prosciutto bits all over and lightly pressed and toasted!

Well, since I was running so late we decided just to go around the corner from his place to Tria.  I've always wanted to check it out, so it was cool.  \n\nWe got there close to 9:30 pm and the hostess asked us if we wanted seating, and if so, we would have to wait.  Well, before we could even make our decision, a girl at the bar offered her seat to my companion and I as her date was just around the corner.  \n\nFirst sign that you're in an awesome place:  Nice patrons : )\n\nSo we sat down and ordered some beers.  They had Alagash White on tap ($5 and one of my favorites), so I ordered that while my companion did a \"Tida\" description of what he wanted in regards to beer (\"ummm...something that isn't too heavy, but is kind of not too light, that's not too sweet..something that is...).  The bartender was able to decipher his beer jibberish and got him an awesome draft beer in which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I think he got him a Stoudts Gold Lauger ($5).\n\nRight when we got our drinks one of the cocktail tables became available and the hostess was kind enough to give us the head's up.  We got up to move and a server told us that she would bring our drinks over to us.  \n\nSecond sign that you're in an awesome place:  Nice host/servers : )\n\nSo, my companion and I sat down and decided to order some snacks.  We ordered the \"Sliced Italian Meats served with Balsamic Red Pepper, Caper Berries and Dijon-Garlic Oil\" ($10) and an order of the \"Goat Cheese, Roasted Garlic and Pesto Bruschetta\" ($3).  It literally took only four minutes for the food to come out.  \n\nThird sign that you're in a truly awesome place:  Fast service : ) \n\nThe Slice Italian Meats plate was much larger than I had expected.  We had 3-4 slices of I think 5 different kind of Italian Meats.  We were also served sliced baguettes to enjoy our meats on.  IT was fabulous!  \n\nThe Bruschetta was pretty good as well.  They were exactly like the ones that I make at home with pesto and garlic bought from Whole Foods on a baguette.  At least I know that I should throw some goat cheese on my homemade ones as well.  The plate came with two slices of baguette so we decided to order another one to absorb the bottle of wine we had previous to coming out.  \n\nNow, the last and final sign that you're in a good place:  Good \"snacks\" : ) \n\nI didn't really have any real \"food\" at Tria so I can only say \"good 'snacks'\".  Hopefully I can make it back there soon to try out the rest of their menu.  HOPEFULLY IT'S A SUNDAY TOO.  Their website has a \"Sunday School\" tab with the Sunday beer/wine/cheese special (1/2 off).  \n\nAll in all, it was a very nice snacking experience.  The bill only came out to $23 or so.  The service was really awesome, the servers were really, really nice (as were the patrons) and we were fueled for a long night of dancing and drinking.

Toted as one of the premier locations for wine and cheese, I assumed it was too fancy for my plebian taste buds. I don't know much beyond \"red, white, and sparkling\" when it comes to wine, and while I absolutely love cheese, that's not saying much. Mostly because I love all foods. All this to say - I was completely wrong in my assumptions about Tria, and I cannot wait to get back. \n\nThrow away the conventions that this wine/cheese bar is merely for the fancy folk. I showed up in sweats midday on a sunny Saturday (the plan was to go for a run, but we ended up at Tria), and I did not feel out of place at all. However, the ambiance is really nice and classy, so it could definitely be fancy if you wanted it to be. This location (as there are two others in the city) is pretty small. Table seating is limited, but there is bar seating available if you're lucky enough to snag two or three next to each other. Ideally, this place is geared towards parties of 4 or less. There's not really a lot of space, and the waits can be pretty lengthy if you're just planning for an impromptu visit. My one complaint about Tria is they don't have a huge space available to wait for your table, and they don't take cell phone numbers. Which means you have to carefully time it if you decide to wander away. We waited about 40 minutes for our table around 2pm on the weekend, and the place never really hit a slow point. Worth the wait though.\n\nIn regards to food, wine, and cheese? Amazing. Incredible. The bruschetta was to DIE for: we tried the Goat Cheese and Pesto and the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey. Both bursting with flavors. I could easily make a meal of just their bruschetta options. \n\nIf you make it past their snacks and bruschetta, be sure to check out their gourmet sandwiches, salads, and desserts. It was pretty difficult to make a decision, but I settled on the Prociutto Cotto Panino topped with Grana Padano and fig jam. The fig jam added a whole new level: an amazing combo of sweet and salty. The sandwich was hot, huge, filling, and delicious. You can tell every ingredient offered here is of the highest freshness and quality. \n\nEven in my sweats, with limited knowledge of wine and cheese, I never felt like I didn't belong. Both the wine and cheese menu are organized in a way that even the most ignorant foodies can identify something(s) they'd like; and if you don't? The staff was kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable. \n\nI'm counting down until my next visit to Tria. Central to downtown, it's close to shopping, Rittenhouse park, and other bars. It's the perfect place for a girl's lunch or a romantic date, but you can also come here in yoga pants and go hog.

(and no i haven't been drinking beer since HS!)  So when my Dad suggested checking out Tria for our first stop on the beer trip to Philly, i was excited that they had something i could easily drink and keep up with the rents: wine.  \n\nHowever my plan was nearly foiled when i sat down and saw they had a Russian River tap.  I kept saying to myself \"Please let them have Pliny, please let them have pliny\".  They didnt, but still the beer selection here was awesome.  The fact that they even offered Russian River (from California) was great.  Other beers included Belgian style ales... great for the rents, but not my cup of tea.\n\nSo i opted for one of their wines.  They had probably 20 plus different wines and it ended up being a very difficult decision on my part.   I started with the reisling, which was very sweet and very good.  Then i progressed to the Shiraz which was very sharp and immediate caused the heart burn.  but thats the price i must pay for good wine.   I will say that the wines run 8-12 bucks a glass, so choose wisely!    You'd hate to spend all that money for something you didn't like.  The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable, and the descriptions on the menus of the wine are very accurrate.\n\nThe food seemed to be unqiue and intrigueing, but expensive.  There were a lot of different cheese selections, but the plates i saw had more bread than cheese.    I would have liked to have seen a sampler platter or some kind of combination of cheeses.    The one seemingly reasonable thing were the different brushettas.  I got the goat cheese and pesto, which was awesome.  But it only came with two slices of bread.  For $3.50, thats a little much.  \n\nOverall, the prices are high, but the quality is great.  It would be a great place to grab a quick drink, but i'm not sure that i would be willing to go here on a regular basis.

Well, the two customers next to us had the bill sitting on their table for at least 20 minutes before they attempted to pay, and continued to sit there an additional 15 or 20 after they paid. Meanwhile, our last friends had arrived and were waiting to the side for the seating to become available. Our server asked if we wanted to move to a 6-seater tabletop or wait as the customers were clearly finished, and we elected to wait. After another 15 minutes, we let the server know we wanted to move to the 6 seater because the table next to us clearly wasn't leaving anytime soon (they left about 15 minutes after we moved). \n\nI felt a hostess or manager should have asked the customers who were finished and just chatting if they would mind moving to the bar since people were waiting for their table.

We walked inside and asked the hostess if we could please sit outside - but we were denied because they were \"trying to accommodate their indoor patrons,\" or something like that.

But that's because I used to love this place.  I was happy to have a cool, comfortable place in the neighborhood to work on my laptop while sipping on a latte.  Now, they've sealed up most of the power outlets to keep customers from camping out too long (probably a good business decision, but annoying nonetheless), and you have to make a purchase every hour in order to get a unique wi-fi \"code\" to use their network.  Again, probably good for profits, but do I need to keep having the network drop while I'm working or sending an email?  What Mugshots fails to get is that people WILL spend money if they hang out for a couple of hours, without all the restraints and rules.  Those tend to fly in the face of the laid-back, bohemian vibe they've got going on.\n\nStill...good sandwiches, salads, coffee, and tea.  Plus they're fair-trade and organic, which I kind of like.  \n\nWish I could do better than a 3, but they're not really there..sorry.", "date": "2011-03-27 00:33:26", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 18, "average_stars": 3.33, "yelping_since": "2011-02-15 22:15:46"}}

I had some time to kill before catching my bus, so I didn't really mind standing in line for a while and browsing their menu. Looks like they have some tasty options, and as someone looking to incorporate more vegan and local cuisine into my diet, I found the menu exciting.  However, the prices on some of these things (and the fact that I was on my way to a Honey's Brunch-- seriously, an addiction) deterred me.  \n\nAs a company that snubs Starbucks (and hey, I do too, so I appreciate it!), I was a little perplexed by their coffee menu, which looked like it had some pretty frou-frou and expensive drinks not unlike the bigger chains.  I like places that list a cup of coffee as being COFFEE, not Americano, or \"mugshot,\" whatever that is (is it their coffee? plain? Suppose I could've asked).  I got the Mayan Chai tea, mainly because I found their coffees overpriced.  Let me say, it was delicious!

Probably my biggest peeve about DD is that they don't have milks and sugars out on a counter for you to mix in, but my problems with Dunks' should probably be reserved for a different review.\n\nOverall, cute little place, a little overcrowded and hipstery/yuppie-ish, but I like their mission to provide decent vegetarian/vegan options and fair-trade drinks.", "date": "2008-12-11 16:46:03", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 78, "average_stars": 3.93, "yelping_since": "2008-10-03 13:56:00"}}

The place was very crowded, and when it was our turn to order we noticed that there weren't any free seats. So my girlfriend told the cashier that we weren't sure if we were going to order because of the lack of available seating. Before she even finished this sentence, the cashier smirked, pointed to the line like we didn't know it was there, and gestured to the person behind us to place their order. She didn't say a single word to us. \n\nI understand that that isn't the type of thing a cashier wants to hear when it is busy. We were, however, going to ask her for just a second to decide what we wanted to do. But apparently she didn't feel like giving us the chance. It's like she felt that she was doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to order, and since we had inconvenienced her so terribly she decided to revoke that privilege. Overall, this woman came off as impatient and condescending. I must say it is ironic for a cashier to have a superiority complex. \n\nThe very fact that there was no available seating was also, in itself, annoying. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but I looked around a bit and noticed that about half of the customers were sitting there typing away on their Macbooks while nursing small coffees (some of them were just drinking water from Nalgene bottles). Even worse, many of them were sitting alone at tables meant for multiple people. And worst of all, every single one of them was a hipster. \n\nI know I am going to tick a lot of people off with these comments, but let's be serious here: Mugshots isn't just a \"coffee shop\" like Starbucks. They also serve breakfast and lunch. And people would like the opportunity to sit down and eat said foodstuffs. But they don't get the chance if everyone else thinks its acceptable to buy a cup of coffee and then sit there for extended periods of time writing term papers, brooding poetry, or whatever they consider to be trendy. This is fine when the place isn't so busy, but during rush hours it is downright inconsiderate. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY PUT A ONE HOUR LIMIT ON WIFI ACCESS FOR CUSTOMERS!!!!!\n\nI should mention that although we left without ordering, we had been to Mugshots once before and the food was pretty tasty. This doesn't make up for the awful customer service and the droves of self-absorbed \"cool kid\" customers, however. \n\nSo in sum, go to Mugshots if you enjoy:\n-Good sandwiches (if you don't mind paying high prices and waiting a half an hour for your food to come out)\n-Snarky and disrespectful staff members\n-Not being able to find an open seat\n-Being around gaggles of hipsters who think the place is a library, or a Starbucks, or something. \n\nEND RANT!", "date": "2012-03-05 06:06:36", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 15, "average_stars": 2.67, "yelping_since": "2011-10-09 21:51:41"}}

When I confronted the the staff about this (I had to...TWICE) it took them a whole 15 MINUTES to do come over and fix it. They told me they were \"busy\". There were 5 customers in the entire cafe.\n\nSo we can finally see and (kind of) hear the movie after missing the first 20 minutes. The rest is fine until it hits 8:30PM and the clean up begins. Translation: clattering of pots and pans, clinking glass and loud banter amongst the staff. We have to strain to hear the rest of the movie - I don't dare ask a third time to turn up the volume for fear of the jarring sneers. \n\nI understand that the priority here is the caf\u00e9 but WHY have a movie showing if you aren't going to take any care to make it a pleasurable viewing experience?\n\nIt's disappointing because the food (seitan rice bowl) and drink (toasted almond/vanilla Italian soda) were really good.

It was mad busy when we went there but we found a table without much trouble. My girlfriend got the Vegan BLT with apple and enjoyed it thoroughly. They use the tempeh bacon which I am generally not a huge fan of, but overall, the sandwich was delicious. She also got the vegan chili and was unable to finish it due to it being way too hot for her... which made it perfect for me!  I got \"The Slammer\"  which is a wrap with vegan sausage, guacamole, salsa and lettuce. It was a tad small for my liking, but the taste was undeniably good.\n\nThe also offer a ton of smoothies, juices and milkshakes all with vegan options.

I am not a huge coffee afficianado so unless something it really bad, it's pretty much all the same to me.\n\nOne of the overriding negative comments on here about this place is the slow service.

It took us about 10 minutes to even order and another 20 for our names to be called for our food... not that bad given how busy it was.

I have never once had an experience there related to customer/employee interaction that has EVER been more than a two at most. I'm going to go ahead and share all of these experiences. Maybe (but probably not) someone at Mugshots will care this time. \n\nToday: Brought all my school work and computers down to Mugshots to work on school work. There Wi-fi is accessible for 60 minutes only with purchase and with a code provided by the cashier (I am not even complaining about this fact but still, come one guys, free wi-fi is a little give for a lot of get in the coffee shop world. Your image could use a boost.). I also ordered an egg, tomato, guacamole, and cheese sandwich and an americano. Americano was fine. Sandwich was made with obviously old guac...it was brown, cold, and flavorless as avocados tend to become when refrigerated for too long. I was contemplating asking for a different sandwich but then I thought better of it because I would just be met with blank stares and don't care attitudes (those things are extremely commonplace with the staff). The first code I received for wi-fi access came up with \"promotional access denied.\" So I asked for assistance, was given another code, and that one did not work either. When I went back to the counter and said that it didn't work either the guy said he didn't know. He asked two of his co-workers about it and they said \"Last time it happened, we had to call the company.\" Then the three of them kinda stood there with blank stares (like I said, a common response). Then the guy said \"Well, how do I do that.\" One girl shrugged her shoulders and the other said \"Oh, I don't know I don't go into the office.\" More blank stares then the guy said to me, \"Sorry, I don't know what to do.\" What?! You DO know what to do, dude. Call the company and fix the problem. Obviously this has happened before as your co-workers pointed out and obviously the solution is to call the provider. However, none of them wanted to do it so I was told \"Too bad.\" Really, Mugshots? You know how to solve a problem but you don't do it because...you're lazy? You don't want to? It's not \"your\" job? What is it? This is a common theme throughout all of my negative experiences here. Disconnected, disinterested, too-cool-for-school employees who can't be bothered with simple customer service. \n\nA summary of other complaints:\n\n1. A few weeks ago I ordered an Americano. There were three people at the registers and one person in the kitchen area. I waited 18 minutes (I timed it on my phone) before I said anything. I said \"excuse me, is someone going to make my drink?\" Yes, I said it with a little bit of an attitude. The girl stared at me (blank stares!) then said, \"Yea, give me am minute\" and went back to the registers where two other people were (there are only two registers so...) Two minutes later she went to the espresso machine clearly annoyed and sloppily made my drink. It was filled all the way to the top making it difficult to carry to the condiment stand. I felt it was done on purpose. My evidence: the smirk and \"here you go\" delivered with an attitude when she handed me the drink.\n\n2. Last Saturday morning (an insanely busy time at Mugshots) I was waiting in line along with 16 other customers (I counted because I wanted to write a Yelp review and be accurate) for my morning coffee. Some man walks in the door, cuts to an open register before the woman waiting in line gets to it. The woman seemed confused and said she was too embarrassed to say anything so I leaned over and said to the cashier, \"That man just cut in front of everyone.\" The cashier look flustered, said \"oh, I just got here\" and continued to help the man instead of asking him to wait in line. Yea, no. \n\n3. The food and drink are over-priced for the quality of customer service. I understand that Mugshots supports local and sustainable farms and I truly appreciate that and understand that that means higher prices. I wouldn't have a problem paying them if I was treated like the PAYING customer that I am.\n\n\nSo, the reason why I keep going here is two-fold. One, I live 4 blocks away and I will put up with a lot for convenience and non-Starbucks coffee. Two, I'm somehow convinced it will get better. I, for some reason, believe management will catch on to the arrogant, disrespectful ignorant way it's staff operates and make changes.

I almost feel like I don't need to review La Colombe, as everyone is aware of its existence.  I used to go to La Colombe often, before I saw the light of what actual quality coffee tasted like.  So I have this complex opinion about La Colombe, but I think I've kind of seen the light for what it is. \n\nFirst off, yes it's inexpensive relatively for okay coffee. But you're trading off the fact that you're not getting great coffee. The coffee itself is nothing to write home about. I'd go without it.  The espresso is good, I usually get a double macchiato or a cappuccino when I go there. I'd say that the place is fairly mechanical, and it will give you the same thing on a consistent basis.\n\nSpeaking of consistency, you will always find yourself with a long line and seating is at a premium. You'll find a lot of couples who will be ravenous in the line, send one person to get a seat, while the other waits in line. This is the name of the game, as no one is really respectful enough to wait in line together.  There's a tendency for there to be loud children with their parents, thrashing their strollers back and forth, trying to, simultaneously, annoy the shit out of you by making an obstacle course, quiet their crying child via carelessly rocking the baby without any regard to the actual problem, and keep talking about that new Dior bag that Veronica just could not live without that they just think is trite.\n\nThere's a tendency for haughty privileged middle-aged couple to boast about their 401k's loudly in front of you in hope of you hearing how successful their meaningless life is.  If you can't tell, I don't really like the fanbase that La Colombe has.  Let me put it this way:  I'm surprised I haven't seen Mary Kate Olsen talking about her Vera Wang snuggie in this joint.  I've never gotten through an hour at La Colombe without the need of rolling my eyes at some absurdity like this.\n\nI'm always amused that these people that are enthralled by expensive things go to a place where the coffee is mediocre, and could be better somewhere else by just adding a couple of quarters to the price.  I think La Colombe has a certain reputation of being amazing in Philly. I don't understand it though.\n\nIt's almost mechanical, where people expect the same cup every day when they go here, and they will get it here. The blend never changes, from what I can tell, and there's nothing truly exciting about La Colombe.  I like their carbonated water machine and almond croissant. That's about as excited as I get about this place.\n\nIn summary: If you're a douchebag that's spent all but two of their dollars on a new Michael Kors bag, and you need to go to a place to be around like minded douchebags to display your newly acquired display of \"wealth,\" get a coffee here, and put a bunch of sugar substitute and skim milk in it.

These farmers are not exactly members of the financial elite.\nhere goes:\n\nSo, I'm a Philadelphian... I was born here... educated here... I grew up in the cafe culture that it has... La Colombe used to rock my world with some milk and sugar.  Then, I went to Portland to visit some family and accidentally discovered Stumptown coffee and my eyes have forever since seen the light.  After a week in Portland, I came back to La Colombe super stoked for espresso.  I noticed the difference immediately.\n\nHere's the deal, La Colombe jumped onto the early 90's coffee band wagon and made an acceptable product for the times.  They were successful in a town that never really had much to claim for coffee, as opposed to the NW, Italy, or the Nordic regions.  Being successful, they never bothered to continue and progress or refine they're product.  Nor their barista's training, which after the farmer and roaster is the last platform in pulling off noticeably incredible coffee.\n\nA lot has happened over the last decades, in coffee.  Todd Carmichael, one of the owners, has been too distracted (crossing the South Pole) and too lazy (http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/worst-coffee-trends-060210) to take heed or notice.\n\nAnd it's easy  to see the latter when you a) check out the coffee, which is bad tasting b) check out the machinery which in my years frequenting his store has NEVER BEEN CLEANED (milk encrusted steam wands) and c) has non-transparent coffee... that is that who knows where the coffee's coming from... which is deceptive and typically a hint that the coffee is grown unethically and crappy.\n\nBut hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I encourage all who will read this to check out their website (which mentions coffee that tastes like \"exclusive\" ..?.. not cocoa or berries or ...ya know, real food); check out their coffee and espresso; does it have a roast date listed? Coffee has a short sweet spot after being roasted... less than a few weeks; are their beans really oily (proof of over-roasting or being too old); see how bad and unsympathetic their baristas are.  Then go to a shop like Ultimo, Spruce Street Espresso, Bodhi, or Capogiro and notice the difference.  The craziest part about the last referenced cafe is that they use La Colombe beans and due to their care for details actually pull a half decent shot of their espresso, despite the odds.\n\nWhen you care about how a crop is farmed, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared, the product usually tastes better (coors light or yards?).  Also, pretension doesn't equal good product and the great cafes mentioned above don't mix the two.\n\nI also encourage La Colombe to do a better job and give a crap about what they do and serve.  But with owners that are this out of touch and nihilistic, I don't see that happening.  For an interesting critique on Todd Carmichael's bogus article check out Chris Tacey's review.  It's interesting.  http://godshot.blogspot.com/2010/06/thank-you-sir-may-i-have-another.html\n\nHere's to better coffee in a town that's worth getting excited over.", "date": "2011-04-01 04:57:06", "useful": 22, "funny": 5, "cool": 5, "user": {"review_count": 6, "average_stars": 3.5, "yelping_since": "2010-07-08 00:53:23"}}

What actually happened was something different.  When you first walk into the space it looks pretty cool.  You get closer to the counter and the baristas are spot on friendly and make you feel welcome.  I see the two big espresso makers behind the counter, they look convincingly cool.  I get my cafe mocha in a ceramic mug since I'm planning on grabbing a table and being respectful of the planet.\n\nWe eye an empty table and snag it. I look down at my mug and the coffee looks good, a nice finishing touch with the froth. I sip my drink expecting that moment of it's going to be pretty hot, but it's going to be drinkable.  Well...turns out my coffee was not very hot at all, it was a little warmer than room temperature.  That was the first let down.  Then I take another sip, where's the mocha flavor?  The mocha is TOTALLY lacking, almost no sweetness at all to my drink.  When I order from of my usual coffee joints I usually ask for half the amount of mocha.  I don't seek out mocha because I want a drinkable candy bar so it's not that I love it overly sweet.  I just like a hint of mocha, yet this drink, no hint.  In fact you could have told me I was drinking a cappuccino and I would have said you were right.  Big time fail on the cafe mocha guys.  \n\nSo, as I am complaining about my drink to my wife I am also noticing the decor.  The incredibly half ass \"faux painting\\finishing\" on the walls.  Seriously. can you please put some money and imagination into what your coffee joint is going to look like.  Sorry, but besides very good customer service this place failed miserably.  One last good thing, the price was very reasonable.  Then again, bland, semi-warm coffee doesn't deserve a high price tag.  \n\nThe place was packed though and kept getting more and more packed.

My days started and ended with La Colombe's cappuccino, enjoyed in either the Rittenhouse Square or the cafe itself. I've found only one other cafe, Cafe Trieste in Berkeley, whose cappuccino matches La Colombe's.\n\nAt first, I only studied at La Colombe. (To be honest, I still haven't found another cafe where I feel comfortable studying as I had at La Colombe. Must be something about their seating...) As I became a regular, I found myself drawn into intriguing conversations. La Colombe remains my dream cafe: an excellent team of baristas serving great beverages to interesting patrons studying, reading, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, and engaging in witty conversations.\n\n******************\n\nIn reading the reviews thus far, it seems there has been plenty of coverage about the coffee but only mostly negative feedback for the cafe. So here's my lowdown. Decide what you will:\n\n*Opens and closes early: 7am-6pm ish. There are usually a handful of people already waiting at the door before the barista is ready to open. On the weekends!\n*The baristas are amazing. The best I've seen anywhere. Incredibly efficient and fast! It helps that most patrons are regulars and know what they want. If you become a regular, the baristas will remember what you usually order and ask you if you want your usual. I varied and hence they never presumed. However, I've seen them notice regular patrons standing in line, serve up their drinks by the time the patrons reach the bar, and off the patrons simply pay and go. It reminded me of a well-choreographed dance. Tip them well if you become a regular. You may get free beverages and useful connections out of it.\n*The baristas are all very attractive. They are all people who've other lives, for which networking at La Colombe comes in handy. They know who's who. I consider them to be, to some degree, involved in the weaving of a particular Philadelphian scene. They've never snubbed me. I've never seen them snub anyone. They've always been super professional and discrete.\n*There is no menu. Can be intimidating for newcomers and those who like to know how much things cost. Order what you've liked elsewhere. The baristas will make most drinks people would ever want, and they'll let you know if they do not make/have a particular drink/ingredient. Just don't ask for soy milk. Skim is as far as they go. Remember, you're at a cafe owned by a Frenchman. Don't balk at the price. It'll be worth it.\n*The iced cappuccino is crack.\n*In terms of food, they only offer a limited quantity and variety of pastries. The almond croissants are fantastic. Less a fan of the scones. All can be gone by midday. There's a day (Mon?) when they have no pastries due to logistics. The baristas don't mind at all if you bring your own food. The regulars can be seen eating burgers from Loie's next door.\n*Only cash.\n*The place can get packed. Then, take your drink to go and stroll through Rittenhouse Square if you were planning on lingering. Or ask someone if you might share a table. People have always been obliging. Then, table hop when one becomes available. I've spent entire afternoons table hopping to my preferred spot or from one conversation to another.\n*I tend to see two types of patrons: those who want conversations (i.e. are networking/socializing) and those who want to study. If you plan to study, don't sit near the front. Sit as far away from the bar and door as possible. Generally, although not always, this is where the studious sit whereas those who want conversation, the regulars, choose tables closer to the bar and the door. Invest in noise cancelling headphones, although they'll block out the music but definitely not conversations. If you're an attractive woman or man who comes regularly, the regulars will strike up conversations with you sooner or later. If you don't want that to happen, good luck.\n*The baristas and the regulars are characters. Interesting to get to know. Consider yourself warned.\n\nLa Colombe Cafe off Rittenhouse Square can be more than just a cafe. Your experience of La Colobme, ultimately, is what you make of it. I chose to make it one of my networks/a scene. Those who prefer otherwise need not.

My first time in I remember being a bit underwhelmed by the taste of the coffee, but I kept going back to La Colombe because that's where I would meet my friends, I knew someone who use to work there,  it was close and convenient, and frankly I wasn't aware that better coffee could be found in Rittenhouse. \nNow I've found the better places, (read: Joe, Elixir, Nook). At La Colombe the espresso tastes  bitter and gross, the cappuccino has a nice foam but you can barely taste the coffee underneath all that milk, the regular coffee also tastes burnt and forces itself to be consumed with either milk or sugar.  Also it is very lame they don't offer soy milk. Now I don't really like regular milk, but I make an exception to drink it in coffee sometimes, on a regular basis however I would prefer to drink soy milk or I choose to drink my coffee black.  When I once inquired about why they didn't offer soy milk the barista told me the owner was a traditionalist. Hmmm interesting...  I could go on a rant about that in itself but I  won't.\n\nAll in all  I think La Colombe is the kind of place for people who have graduated up from drinking Starbucks and Dunkin'  and by that I mean they still take their coffee with lots of cream and sugar, but they still don't know what wonderful coffee can really taste like. \n\n \n***Also yes the water machine is really cool, I get it, I like it too. But if part of reason you are swayed to frequent a coffee shop is because of its water, well doesn't that say something?", "date": "2013-07-29 21:29:51", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 25, "average_stars": 3.84, "yelping_since": "2013-04-14 23:54:53"}}

It seems the key attraction of this place is that they are not one in a chain of stores serving up commoditized beverage widgets. As you'll notice, when walking through the front door, there are no price boards. They simply assume that you are willing to pay, being that you've decided to visit. This can be a classy alternative to dealing with customers that hold up the line as they attempt to make a decision. Most patrons seem to know exactly what they want, so this is a coffee shop where no explanations are necessary. \n\nThe customer profile seems a little different than the regular coffee shop. They appear to be just a little more mature, just a little more sophisticated to a degree. From professional mothers to grad students studying for their upcoming exams, you'll find a subtle difference to the kinds of people filing through the door on a hectic weekday afternoon. \n\nWhen I approached the counter, the girl attending appeared to have a bit of a poor attitude, but when I heard her speak, I realized she was foreign. I appreciate friendliness more than the exoticness of the nationality of the person behind the counter, but I'm not complaining. She handed me a paper cup of the drip brew, then a lid on a dish with a spoon. I really appreciated the way they have all their sugars and creams seated in ornate pots on the front counter. But I wanted to discover the fineness of their brew unmolested by those fixings. \n\nWhen I asked the male at the counter, he told me the coffee was their \"Corsica,\" a multi-region blend. As I sipped it, the coffee seemed to be only medium bodied, with little to no acidity, and an underwhelming flavor. In fact, it seemed that it was just a little bit watery. They may want to check the proportions of their water to their coffee, because as it was, I didn't think that it was anything to get excited about. It may a few steps up from the brew they serve at Wawa, but hardly deserving of the title \"gourmet.\" \n\nThe furniture in the lobby was fitting: tiny chairs with tiled tables. I noticed their furniture actually matched the ceramic items with which they served their coffee, and that was a nice touch. The music playing in the lobby had it's moments. I prefer the nondescript drizzle of lightly thumping electronica in the background as opposed to a music selection based on the tastes of the people working there. How many times can one hear Rob Thomas and Santana's \"Smooth\" before you get tired of hanging around? \n\nOverall, La Columbe is impressive as a sole proprietorship, but as a coffee shop, it's only a notch above average. If you're in the mood for something different than your regular corporate coffee shop experience, than this is a place for you.

I just ordered a medium ice coffee since I know they must have that...right? \n\nFunny thing was, my husband and brother in law ordered the macchiato thinking it was a drink.

We were comparing it to Starbucks....which is not a good idea!\n\nAlso, I was looking for the restroom and since they had a long line....I didn't want to interrupt the staff.

It really focuses on the coffee, and I'm a tea person, not a coffee person.  I'd appreciate more effort on tea too.  It doesn't take much effort to stock a handful of high-quality loose-leaf teas along with coffee (tea is easier to prepare well than coffee, IMHO), but this place doesn't even seem to try, it just wants to be all about its coffee.\n\nIs the coffee here good?  Ehh.  I do drink coffee, and I have opinions on it, although I'm certainly no expert.  I will say, the stuff I've had here is good, but it is not the best coffee I've had.  In order to justify its coffee-snobbery, I think this place would have needed to really like, AMAZE me with their coffee, and they failed to do this.\n\nI do like that La Colombe does direct trade -- that's great.  I'm also a big fan of shade-grown coffee, both for the taste and because I like the ecological principles behind it, but currently, I have yet to sample or even see for sale a single shade-grown coffee from this company.  Supposedly they have one in their \"workshop\", but I have yet to try it.  This company is lagging behind others, there are so many good shade grown coffees on the market.\n\nWhat about the ambiance in this particular shop?  I don't like it.  The walls are red, and it feels...for lack of a better descriptor, arid, conjuring up images of parts of the American Southwest or drier parts of the Mediterranean.  It doesn't feel cozy or comforting to me.\n\nThere's also a sort of weird vibe here that I don't like.  One of my friends articulated it to me, that there's a long line of people who seem to know a lot about coffee and know exactly what they want.  The people working the counter are nice, but when I've been in here, it's been busy and high-pressure, you get to the front of the line and you don't have time for chit-chat.  I don't like that sort of vibe.  I'd rather go to a sort of friendly, down-to-earth cafe that offers a few shade-grown coffees and has a good tea selection too, a place where I can chat with the people behind the counter a bit without feeling like I'm imposing on the people behind me.\n\nAnd lastly, the baked goods?

My fellow Yelpers are greatly divided in their reviews of La Colombe of late. It seems as if a lot of the negative reviews are due to either the clientele, or the fact that the coffee is not that good (due to the hype?), or the place hasn't changed with the times as Americans become more and more particular about their coffee. My take is that I like this place. I like the coffee and the staff, and thankfully, have not had to deal with all of the A-holes, D-bags, and Upper Middle Class J-offs that heaps of a Yelpers have been crying about. Trust me, I can be as cantankerous and bitter about uppity wankers, but usually I speak up, and just tell them to shut up. I show up to La Colombe at odd hours, and am never here during a mad rush. I don't live in Philly, and am usually in Rittenhouse in the afternoon, and early evening, so my only pissy gripe is that they (understandably) close at 7pm. And that the bathrooms are sometimes filth pits. \n\nI do agree that La Colombe's coffee isn't the best I've ever had, but its WAY above average. One fellow reviewer stated that he's seen steaming wands crusted with milk, and that the baristas never clean the machines. I disagree. I've seen, the guys and gals that work there take care in what they do. I also ask them questions, and everyone I have spoken to has been extremely helpful. Granted they are not slammed with a million customers at this point. Also, my only order when I go is an espresso. Single, double, or triple. I really don't drink a whole bunch of frothy milk products, so I can't tell you if they do that well or not. The espresso is definitely pulled well, and certainly not the best, but blows most places out of the water. I have been to many European coffeehouses in places such as Austria, France, Italy, and Hungary that have been operating for generations, and have had coffee equal to or inferior to La Colombe. I think coffee can also be a very subjective topic like the cheese steak. Everyone has their opinion of what is the best, and their criteria is almost always different than your own.

Elixir's coffee just wasn't that great and Joe's latte cost me an arm! \n\nNow, I'm not going to rave about their coffee for too long (lots of posts about that on here I'm sure) because I'm usually a drinker of decaf. I am super sensitive to caffeine and regret it every time I order \"full caff\" coffee.  I try to be super woman though and think I can take it. I was too excited to try their ice draft coffee (something they just started offering in the past couple of months and no they don't offer it in decaf) and was jittery within an hour.  Don't let la colombe's 12 ounce cup size full you. I feel that smaller serving of coffee from la Colombe packs the same amount of caffeine as a 16 ounce pike place roast at Starbucks. \n\nNow what I do want to rave about and my FAVORITE drink here, is their HOT CHOCOLATE!!! This is hands down the best hot chocolate I've had from a coffee shop! Usually other places make it with chocolate syrup or that nasty cocoa mix made with powdered milk or some kind of hydrogenated milk solids and tons of sugar! I am lactose intolerant so powdered milk is no no for my stomach. La Colombe's hot chocolate is like a cocoa powder latte! I get it made with almond milk. It comes totally unsweetened. I add a bit of simple syrup to sweeten it. It makes the perfect true dairy free dark hot chocolate! I wish I can just mix almond milk and cocoa powder at home but alas, the steamed almond milk makes it.\n\nThe baked goods here are delicious, too, although they are expensive. I like the chocolate croissants. My coworker is a big fan of their chocolate chip cookie but it's a hard cookie with hard chocolate chips that stick to your teeth.

You could definitely learn more than a thing or two By going down to Bean Exchange Coffeehouse and figuring out how to roast coffee right.\n\nand whats with the attitude that some of your baristas have? grant it I do get great service a lot of times and you have some good people working there. But often times as Nate says I get a snobby server with a high and mighty attitude. um, your pouring me a cup of coffee! maybe you should send them to one of the other cafes that sale your brand so they can learn to get a better server attitude.\n\nYeah. your still one of the best. And in a lot of ways you helped shape the indie coffee scene that's is so prevalent in Philly. So you earned the right to have some off days, just not as many as you've been having. look around you and you'll see a ton of coffee places that are stepping up their game better than you are. Maybe you can work out those kinks and get back to the way that you used to be. Either way I'll probably be back for a cup in the not too distant future.\n\nSincerely ~\nMcThrill", "date": "2008-03-31 15:10:02", "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "user": {"review_count": 1512, "average_stars": 4.17, "yelping_since": "2007-07-13 04:00:59"}}

It wasn't the most complex thing in the world but I've never heard anything like it so I gave it a shot. Great bargain--four bucks. There were also bigger sandwiches on hoagey-style rolls, and salads, and soups. Also, sandwiches come with free salad or chips. I went with the salad.

I can only believe it was later in the day and they never made a new batch of coffee because they were closing early  (2pm). It was a bit of a turn off BUT, the coffee did taste pretty good. Hence, the bump to a solid 4.

I searched for \"omelette\" on caviar and this place came up. MULTIPLE omelette options that extend beyond boring and standard omelette options.

There was also an issue of confusion regarding where our residence actually is. By the time it arrived, our omelettes were ice cold requiring microwaving.

I am probably going to get a lot of heat for this review, but they're all subjective right?\n\nI have lived in the Spring Garden neighborhood for a year and for a year I have been dying to trying Sabrina's. Everyone I spoke to kept telling me how incredible it was, and how the wait (although insane) was always worth it. \n\nOn a particularly hungover Sunday I decided to arm myself with patience and go stand in line for a big indulgent breakfast. The wait for a table for two was about 45 minutes. The place is small and since it was still chilly outside, most of us were jammed in the entrance. I saw big plates of yummy food coming and going, and the amount of people willing to wait for a table was so crazy that I had no doubt this would be a mind-blowing experience. \n\nWhen we finally sat down the service was fabulous. I am sorry I don't remember the name of the sweet server who helped us, but despite the crowd she was attentive and pleasant. I ordered a bagel with lox, my friend ordered a healthy plate of fruit and granola. Since I wanted to get a better taste of the place, we also ordered a short stack of pancakes. No frills, no healthy stuff, just straight pancakes with lots of butter and syrup. \n\nAlthough the meal wasn't bad per se, it wasn't all that mind-blowing either.

I don't understand the hype, unless it is simply the lack of a diner in that area. I personally make better pancakes at home, and the line for a table is definitely not worth it. \n\nMaybe I simply chose the wrong menu items, but I am not sure I'll have the patience to wait another 45 minutes on an empty stomach to risk another OK meal. \n\nSorry Sabrina!", "date": "2013-05-07 18:36:30", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 117, "average_stars": 3.37, "yelping_since": "2011-09-10 23:03:36"}}

Owners Robert and Raquel DeAbreu named the original restaurant on 9th and Christian Streets after their daughter. Recently, for Memorial Day brunch, the GF, our friend, and I went to the second location, which includes the name of their son.\n\nAnd based on the success of these two joints, a third location in University City, by Drexel campus, was opened last year. The inside of Sabrina's Cafe & Spencer's Too is highly reminiscent of a neighborhood cafe/diner. Offering a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, with the occasional snarky, yet fun waitress, it's one of our favorite places to grab brunch.\n\nAnd being that Sabrina's is BYO, our friend brought some champagne along to pair with a pitcher of OJ. And yes, as expected with most BYO's, the markup on the pitcher of OJ is around 400%.\n\nBut back to the good. Sabrina's is great in that they have an ever changing menu of specials. Arrested Development aficionados known that Michael Bluth and company are back in action. So natch, Sabrina's had a bevy of 'Arrested' brunch specials. Creative, whimsical, and most importantly delicious, what's not to love? \n \nBut on this particular outing, we decided to get all of the 'signature' breakfast items.\n\nHuevos Rancheros ($10.99)\n2 blue corn tortillas, smoky chorizo sausage sauce, lime sour cream, spicy guacamole, 2 fried eggs, fried jalapeno pepper\n\nI opted for the huevos rancheros - a nice medley of different flavors, all highlighted by the bright lime sour cream. The fried eggs and chorizo sausage sauce helped to create a hearty dish, with the blue corn tortillas offering some fried texture. The guacamole was nice, but not particularly spicy, though the fried jalapeno pepper had a tempered heat that was nice to add to each bite. The accompanying home fries were crispy on the outside and creamy inside. \nPerfectly seasoned, I could eat these by the ton.\n\nBarking Chihuahua ($8.99)\nFlour tortilla, scrambled eggs, black beans, red peppers, pepper jack cheese, sour cream, marinara\n\nThe GF and our friend both got the barking chihuaha, which amounts to Sabrina's breakfast burrito. A nice iteration of this oft-seen dish, the flour tortilla had a nice grilled texture to it and contained a humongous allowance of perfectly scrambled eggs, black beans, and red peppers. The piquancy of the pepper jack helped to brighten up the dish, with the sour cream and sweet marinara adding creaminess. The fried corn chip strips helped to add additional texture to the dish. A pat of home fries accompanies the burrito as well.\n\nStuffed Challah French Toast (1/2 order $5.50; full order $9.99)\nFarmer's cream cheese, bananas, vanilla bean syrup\n\nPro tip: No matter what, get a half order of the stuffed challah french toast. If the previous two dishes were signature Sabrina's, this is their crown jewel. Not listed on the menu as a half-order option, our waitress knew that we were clearly veterans of the establishment just from this order alone. The french toast is humongous, with a nice grilled exterior and a creamy, eggy interior. This all houses a cinnamon cream cheese that is intensely sweet, yet you just can't stop with one bite. The vanilla bean syrup and fresh banana slices brings this over the top. Definitely a perfect way to end brunch.\n\nWant another tip? On weekends, Sabrina's is packed, so expect to wait at least an hour for a table. So what's a hungry bruncher to do? Call ahead by about an hour and ask to have your name put down. That way you can stroll over when it's about time for your name to be called and you won't have to wait with the rest of the sheep on Callowhill. \n\nFrankly, Sabrina's is a great place to go for any meal - not just brunch. The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, and the food is tasty. What's not to love with this Philly institution? And an added bonus?

I also like the barking Chihuahua when I am feeling very hungry!  Their frittatas are also excellent.  My favorite is the egg white turkey bacon frittata.  Its is a good option if you want a bit of a healthier type breakfast, with no loss of flavor! \n\nI like to come here with my sister and young nephew.  The place isn't bad for kids.  My nephew loves the pancakes and French toast. (He also loves their French fries!)\n\nTheir fruit is always super fresh too, which I love.\n\nFor lunch, I like to get either the Mel's Chicken cutlet (so drool worthy), the Tuscan chicken sandwich, or the Mediterranean wrap.  Everything is different and so flavorful.  Portions are pretty big, so whenever I come with my mom, we often share!\n\nTheir salads are also excellent.  Very often I will split a salad and sandwich with someone I am with, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.\n\nThey do themed brunches too, which is such a great novelty!  Special menu's are available for these with cute puns as all of the menu item names.\n\nThey don't serve dinner at all of their locations, but I highly suggest checking the places that do serve dinner out.  Fantastic meal!  Our go-to's are the octopus and calamari as a starter.  Always a good pick!  If we want something a bit lighter, we go for the hummus.\n\nThe dishes I have had as my main course are the Grilled Orange Ginger Pork Chop, The Honey Melon Glazed Salmon, and the Smokey Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna.  You cannot go wrong with either.  Portions are also pretty big, so make sure you are hungry!!\n\n\nI also really like that this restaurant has plenty of vegentarian and vegan options.   I myself am a carnivore, but I do also enjoy the vegetarian options and have many vegan/vegetarian friends.   It is really nice to have plenty of choices and a variety in the menu which Sabrin'a certainly provides.\n\nThe prices here are pretty reasonable.  The only downside here, is the wait, especially on the weekends. Plus they can get crazy crowded and the space is pretty tight and can get pretty loud. However, I guess that is part of what makes Sabrina's so special.  Also, not a bad place for kids!Certainly worth a wait for the food, staff is always friendly and accommodating!

I was disappointed that my first time stopping this particular one couple months ago ended with disappointment when I was told the wait was 1 hour. \n\nIf you want to skip my extended review, here's the only thing I want you to take away: a little secret - they don't take reservations, but they do take call ahead seating. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS! This allowed me to reduce my wait down to 5 minutes, and everything worked so smoothly without us needing to wait.

I loved the banana bread french toast. To be honest, I spent most of my time picking for my parents, so I didn't really read the description of what I ordered other than its awesome name. The banana bread was quite the surprise. The sweetness of the bread and maple gravy definitely stood out among the savory and salty egg scramble, but it was the perfect balance. The portions were huge!\n\nG. Love's \"Rhyme for the Summertime\" Egg White Omelette: My mom is quite health conscious after discovering that her cholestrol level was a bit too high a couple years ago. I recommended this since it was all egg white. I'm personally all about the egg yolk, but this was well prepared. The omelette was so tender, and the marscapone cheese was a great addition!\n\nSublime's \"Doin' Time (Summertime)\" Mexi Special: Hailing from Southern California, my dad absolutely loves anything that has a \"Mexi\"-style attached to it, especially when it comes with avocado. The food itself was a bit too messy for my liking. Everything seemed to be a mountain piled on top of fried tortilla bread, so that was a bit difficult, and thus disappointing, to eat. The avocado tasted fresh, and rice was well seasoned. \n\nSERVICE: 5/5\n\nAs mentioned above, take full advantage of the call-ahead seating! I promise that you'll come in happier. The waiter we had was super friendly and helpful. She helped clarify all the questions I had, allowed me to have the rice to be served on the side (Dad doesn't like onions which was in the rice), and made sure the egg white omelette my mom had didn't get messed up because it was golden yellow on the outside. My only negative feedback wasn't from this one experience, but the time before. When I was told the wait was going to be 1+ hour, I was treated quite poorly and felt like I was being pushed out the door. I'm glad that wasn't the case this time.\n\nOverall, this place is my favorite brunch place in Philadelphia!

Along with being sliced thinly, to me, it loses some of the good flavor of the pig parts.  It was still good, for sure, but the coating overpowers the innards.\n\nBeyond that, which I fully appreciate is nit-picky, the meal was good.  I like the unchanged lunch counter/diner layout and the staff is young and fast.  Everyone was friendly, but busy, and our \"15-20 minute wait\" evaporated when I asked to sit at the bar.  \n\nIn terms of portions: I could definitely spend the same amount of money - mine was $6.29 for eggs, potatoes, and toast - and get less food.  If I got 2 slices of bread, instead of 4, and half the homies (which are great) I would still feel like I got my money's worth.

At first look, you'll think the place is too crowded to be at all comfortable, but once you're in and seated, you'll feel comfortable even as the wait staff move about quickly and confidently without bumping into anyone and the customers come and go with ease.\n\nThe place may be small, but the portions are HUGE! Big plates, big salads, big sandwiches, gigantic fries. If you're a person who enjoys super-sizing, without the extra cost, here's your place. \n\nAnd not only super-sized, but super-fresh! My 2 lunch mates both ordered the Greek Salad -- one with chicken, one without. The salads came with 8 pita wedges as big as the palm of my hand, a generous dollop of humus, and all the usual salad components: 2 or 3 kinds of salad greens, cherry tomatoes, green pepper slices, feta cheese...onions(?) All this was crisp and fresh; the pita was soft, airy, and slightly buttery.\n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Philly Cheese Steak with the Polenta Cheddar Jalapeno Fries. It's always a gamble when ordering a veggie steak, since I'm not a vegetarian and the taste is always lacking compared to a thick and meaty traditional steak sandwich, but I was curious to see how Sabrina's did it. The steak chunks were browned seitan. The flavor and texture were so right, somehow, that it just didn't matter. In short: it wasn't meat, but the satisfaction was the same! \n\nThe polenta fries looked like mini loaves of cornbread, they were that large. They looked as though they'd been deep fried, but tasted like they'd been baked. The flavor and the airy disintegration once in your mouth was heavenly. The cheddar, the jalapeno, and corn (polenta) tastes were blended so artfully that no single flavor dominated, but all were distinguished and equally evident.\n\nThe wait staff's timing was perfect. They appeared out of nowhere at just the right moments; our waiter was attentive enough and sincere enough to answer our questions about his hebrew-letters tattoo, even though the restaurant was obviously in the very busy lunch mode.\n\nFor the three large plates (as big as my head!) and three non-alcoholic drinks, the bill came to $40.70, including tax. My veggie cheesesteak and polenta fries came to around $12.50.\n\nFor satisfaction, service, and size, you'll be livin' large at Sabrina's...without the need for any large bills!  :o)", "date": "2008-07-12 23:02:07", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 8, "average_stars": 3.75, "yelping_since": "2007-08-03 14:09:42"}}

Ain't NOBODY got time to wait so I used yelp's app to add myself to the list about an hour before patronization. Due to poor time planning and poor winter street hygiene, I almost broke my fucking neck slipping and sliding while rushing here to grab my table the day after our first legit snowstorm of the year. All's well that end's well.\n\nI did make it in the nick of time. We were seated expediently once all members of my party arrived with wine and champagne in tow(aka me, no I'm kidding I was meeting other people...really tho..) in a booth in the far corner. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is not only the ridiculous variety of the menu but the ability to make many items vegetarian. So many fucking things jumped right off of the page, stuffed challah french toast with cream cheese, bananas, and honey topped with bananas  and vanilla bean syrup OR the ultimate mexi scramble with scrambled eggs, pepper jack, bell peppers, tomatoes, BLACK BEAN GRITS, cilantro PESTO, corn chips and avocado as two examples. Ultimately I had to decide and my decision was the classic: HUEVOS RANCHEROS, vegetarian variety. \n\nSo this place is BYOB. We brought some champs and ordered a large jug of OJ. We also brought something else but I don't remember what it was considering we had finished powering through the champagne. \n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time. I'm the breed of idiot that continues to make the same mistake over and over again, one of these mistakes I continuously make is forgetting to order hot suace with my meal. I struggled to flag down a staff-member as they feverishly ran by our table attending to some other shit of another table. Finally I caught someone's attention and managed to obtain a cholula for the table. This place doesn't only have bullshit tabasco, cholula and sriracha are other available options if you enjoy a side of burn-your-fucking-mouth-off as much as I.\n\nThe huevos rancheros were really a work of art, a thing of beauty. I got an above-average number of instagram likes for my photo of this bad boy. Let me walk you through this masterpiece from top to bottom: \n-hot pepper cooked somehow\n-tomato salsa with white cheese shreds\n-guac\n-scrambled eggs (I'm not particularly keen on the standard over-easy on HR)\n-scramble of black beans and vegetarian sausage (they may be part of the scrambled eggs but I cannot tell for certain)\n-tomato sauce\n-hard tortilla shell\n-home-fried potatoes\n\nPlease refer to the photo for more information. All in all this was absolutely spectacular. One of the best brunches I've had in Philly so far. I ate the entire thing. I'm salivating at the thought of it right now. \n\nOne of my eating companions also ordered whole-wheat cinnamon pancakes which I was happy to offer to help consume. They were a touch dry but flavored wonderfully. Syrup improved the dryness. \n\nNeedless to say I was absolutely jam-packed with food in my GI tract at the end of this meal. Even the slightest of movement was torture. It probably saved me some cheddar at whole foods becacuse I could barely look at anything on the shelves. \n\nAll in all this place is a fucking gem and a must visit.", "date": "2018-01-30 21:49:14", "useful": 5, "funny": 6, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 598, "average_stars": 3.94, "yelping_since": "2015-09-02 17:30:11"}}

I only waited because my friends heard such great things about the place.  Once we got in, we could only get seating at the counter even though there were 4 of us.  The food was nasty and so was the service.\n \nThey don't have great or fast service. Most of the time the staff is rude and huffy, probably because there are just too many customers crammed in there.\n\nThe eggs aren't made the way you ask, which really pissed me off.  The cream (for coffee) comes in those little plastic packets and its not real cream (it's the watered-down cheap powder crap that tastes like nothing) and the coffee tastes cheap and burned.  Overall, most of the things you get there feel very cheap and flavorless, kinda like at Midtown except you pay more for it.\n\nAnd one more thing: I'm 6 feet tall, not too abnormal, right? Well, guess what, if you're taller than 5'8, when you sit, your knees are going to be touching the knees of the person in front of you, and don't even try to sit in the booth, because they're made for short people.\n\nI also forgot to mention that they don't have a proper garbage disposal area, so they pile all of their trash on the sidewalk at the end of the day (like 20 big bags of trash), making the whole area smell like trash.\n\nThere are so many cheaper and better quality places to go to in Philly for great brunch. I guess people just don't know any better, so they end up going to dumps like this thinking it's great... kinda like how people from NJ think that Pat's and Geno's is Philly's best cheesesteak.

Nine people walked in at around 9 pm; there was plenty of room, but all kind of interspersed through out the place so the staff decided to combine three tables into a weird L-shaped design which seemed like it would be an awkward dining experience but it worked well for the most part.\n\n2. The aforementioned staff are very friendly, going so far as to joke with individual friends in the group about various things that I wasn't paying attention to because I was so hungry. Also, BYO. Just thought of that.\n\n3. I was kind of confused as to why there were two menus that were handed to us. It was explained to me but now I can't remember. Brunch was not an option when I was there, but it looks absolutely amazing based on the pictures that others have put up so I will definitely be going back to try something else at a brunch-friendly hour.\n\n4. The food: I got some Mediterranean chicken sandwich doohickey. It was good. I was recommended the sweet potato fries. Not a fan. The first few bites were good but after a while, my brain/mouth was confused because they look like fries but taste like dessert, and it was just not a pleasant experience; I actually started getting sick of them and left a large portion uneaten. I thought that I should have gone with the parmesan fries and pilfered some from a friend's plate. Surprisingly they were even less impressive. I tried a friend's sweet potato mashed potatoes (that's kind of redundant) and what little I tried I enjoyed but I'm assuming the same problem with the sweet potato fries would happen if I had gotten that. Everyone's food looked amazing and I have a fair idea of some other things to try the next time I'm there. As of now though, I'm only moderately impressed with what I had. \n\n5. Also, maybe it's just me but why do some people just assume that when a large group of people is present and it's time to pay that the best thing to do is just combine the bill? That's just laziness. The bill comes to something like a $120+, and you thought that only one of us is going to pick up the tab for your convenience? And it's really frustrating thereafter to deal with the mess of calculating how much everyone's meal is and then hand the waitress 8 credit cards and some cash. Just split the damn bill. It's not that hard to do and it saves so much time and frustration. Not to mention, I'm less likely to stiff you on a proper tip if I'm not annoyed.

Short story is- don't get the cheddar/apple omelet.  Long story is- hipsters managing anything is never a good thing.\n\n\nSabrina's, Sabrina's, Sabrina's...what a place!  I'm devoted to the location on the Italian Market; I go there about once every two months or so.  I've even gone for dinner before and had a very pleasant experience.  The two words that come to mind for this place are: consistently wonderful.  So one day I decided to try the Fairmount/Art Museum location.  The atmosphere was very retro chic, the hipsters were oh-so present and the staff was in their usual self involved, semi- friendly state- you know, the norm.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, I decided to go with a semi-normal (or so I thought) dish that was on the healthier side- an omelet with cheddar and apples.  After being served, I took my first bite and couldn't believe my taste buds; there was cinnamon in the apples..no wait- the apples were baked and COVERED in cinnamon.  HUH?  Not only was this not explained on the menu, it seemed to be a pretty standard dish, which was I went with it.\n\nDue to the extremely busy morning, our server never returned to the table, but across the way I saw a hipster who was well dress and seemed to be smiling- must be a manager, I thought.  Naturally, he made his way over to my table and asked how my meal was.  My response was \"well, I ordered this omelet with apples but was surprised to see cinnamon in it\". His response was \"what are you allergic?\".  \"No\", I said, \"But it doesn't state that on the menu and it just seems like an odd choice for an omelet\".  \"Well\", he said, \"that's Sabrina's! We are constantly coming up with interesting combinations\".  He then walked away.  \n\nListen, dude.  (playing the manager card-), I get and even said that I know Sabrina's very well and frequent it (and always order their specials).  All *I* was saying was that you should state that there is cinnamon on the (baked) apples in the menu- that's all.  Not only were you obnoxious and overly dismissive, you could have CARED less about the obvious.  I am a manager myself, and would never even think about handling an upset customer that way.  All you had to say was \"Sorry about that- you make a good point.  How about a free dessert\"?  POOF- the whole thing would have been over and I probably would have declined the dessert.  Instead-  all of the members in my party commented on how unbelievably rude you were, and we all left with a sour (actually sweet) taste in our mouths.\n\nThink I'll stick with the Italian Market location.", "date": "2012-01-18 17:31:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 16, "average_stars": 3.65, "yelping_since": "2011-08-20 18:32:44"}}

This is also supposed to be one of the top brunches in town. \n\nWe needed a tasty brunch/breakfast before we started off our Art Museum Sunday so we decided on this place. It was packed which I believe is the norm. Luckily we only had to wait for 15-20 minutes for a table(totally acceptable). As we were leaving there was a huge crowd that had gathered outside. Much of our Philly trip had those results. Apparently we were the trendsetters arriving before everyone else. \n\nSabrina's takes advantage of all of their space. There are some 2 person tables packed tightly together which makes it difficult for patrons and staff to get through. I'd advise not going with a large group. You might get lucky, but it doesn't seem like a great place to put tables together.\n\nThey have breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner options. There were quite a few things that I immediately wanted as soon as I opened the menu!\n\nI probably should've ordered something sweet but I decided to pick something off their July 4th menu. It was August 7th and they still had that menu! I'm not sure if they call it July 4th menu or if they keep it around through the summer. \n\nI chose John Hancock's Sign Me Up For That Special Breakfast. This dish consisted of blueberry cornbread(stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto), scrambled eggs, arugula, crispy bacon, and cauliflower white cheddar sauce. The cornbread was good but too dry. The white cheddar sauce did help some, but not much. The menu also said it was stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto... um, no it wasn't! I love arugula but I don't think I've ever mixed it with eggs. The scrambled eggs with arugula and cauliflower white cheddar sauce... go ahead and give me two dozen of them on a second plate! Delicious! Bacon is like bacon everywhere. It's bacon. It's either crispy, crunchy, fatty, on a doughnut, or even peanut buttery... wait, I need to stop before this becomes a Butterfinger commercial(Extra kudos if you get the reference).\n\nThe dish also came with their fried potatoes. Can we just take a moment to appreciate a place that knows the difference between a fried potato and a fry? Most places like this try to call fried potatoes what they're not(fries). Fried potatoes are obviously different than fries! Kudos to Sabrina's for that. I also added peppers to my FRIED POTATOES... great choice!\n\nI took off one star because it is a cramped space. If you need a nice quiet meal away from people or you're anti-social, then definitely don't go here. That one star off is also because it's not the best brunch I've tried. It was delicious.

My daughter went there to meet a friend for brunch and they will literally three people at the Palantine location sitting down and eating.

The managers should work with the hostesses and inform them that if the restaurant is half empty or three quarters empty that they should seat the customer right away, whether the whole party is there or not. \n\nThis is supposed to be an upscale caf\u00e9/ restaurant and if it's going to stay that way they should have an upscale attitude on how to treat a customer.

Sabrina's Cafe is a popular (as in, during summer, it's an often sight to see the Sunday brunch crowds line up outside!) series of establishments in Philadelphia, specializing in big, enormous portions for the average hungry Jane/Joe, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere enjoying classics most people are accustomed to, with their own twist, such as burgers, platters, pancakes/French toast, salads, and breakfast/lunch fare, to name a few. I haven't had a chance to enjoy their vegan/vegetarian items, but from testimonials from guests I dine with here, they're the best, and brings out the flavor they've been seeking, and can even substitute some items. There's five (5) locations, including this one close by to Philly's museums and the heart of downtown, the \"main\"/flagship/first location in Italian Market, another one in University City close to Penn U, one outside of Philly in the suburbs of Wynnewood, and a location in Collingswood, NJ, catering to those who would love to have a good meal. For those interested, they allow for BYOB, just make sure it's solely wine/beer/alcoholic beverage only, and be responsible! They're also wonderful handling kids menus, although a few offerings \"seem\" to be a bit over the top for a child.\n\nI've visited on many different occasions to the three Sabrina Cafe's in Philly, especially this location, so let's begin, and I'll base my review on my latest visit to make things relevant! Decided to visit on one of their quiet moments vs the bustling weekend, and I've made a reservation to make sure I can sit down and enjoy some of their best offerings. As what other Yelpers would allude to, portions are huge! If you're coming from a lengthy trip (in my case, near NYC), the first thing that comes to mind is to fill up on some morning delights. Starred off with a bowl of granola and fruit, it's satisfactory, can help get your morning started with some fresh fruit and a balanced breakfast. While waiting in between dishes, I've took a gander at the restaurant and paced around to convey other people's opinions: most were delighted to be there, loved the scenery, and of course, the chalk art is something to look forward to every visit. Ordered something \"simple\" in my books, a challah French toast, plus strawberries, since at the end of the day, you'll be thankful later to top it up with toppings, whether it's a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit (depends on the time of the year), marshmallows, bacon (not for me), and more instead of facing \"plain\" French toast, nothing wrong, but \"berry\" good to put Tuesday cheer! Digging in to those thick, huge slices of French toast, it's bringing me back to those carefree days where I've first arrived here - and the feeling was the same: soft, fluffy French toast inside, slight crunch on the crust, and ample amount of maple syrup. It left me at 110% satisfaction, and if time allowed, I would've ordered more. Delighted with my food and finely brewed latte, I've gave my waitress a generous thank you, and parted ways to continue my day. : ) A general wrap up, but their \"signature\" item in my mind would be the Stuffed Challah French toast, which perfectly captures the balance between bananas, honey, and cream cheese (it's Philly after all...), and seems to \"bigger\" than French toast, and pancakes are another option if you'd love to, I usually request banana or chocolate chips (premium).\n\nIn short, this is the premier brunch (or breakfast in this case) spot in Philly I would go to to unwind. Weekends, the crowd triples (or in summer, quintuples) in size, and it's a common sight to wait ~30min+ without careful planning, and service, as with other places, would be sluggish at best. Distance may be an issue in my books, but it's delighted Philly residents far and wide, and I'll definitely return!

While potentially influenced by the challenge in transporting brunch items, there was just too much inconsistency in the food. I would lean towards lunch over breakfast on a return visit.\n\nQuality: Breakfast foods are not always the best for take-out, but we took a chance with Sabrina's Cafe anyway. And while I am sure eating things immediately would have helped the quality, there was clearly some inconsistencies with the food. I started with a slice of the Avocado Toast, and I felt the thick multigrain bread was a very wrong choice to be used. The Huevos Rancheros were hurt by some delay sogginess, but the overall flavor was good. The Tots were interesting, but an extremely heavy item. The bites I had of the two sandwiches were my favorites, with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich slightly beating out Mel's Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. And the Cannoli French Toast, which I expected to be my favorite item, proved to be way too much in terms of sweetness.\nQuantity: Huge portions and we ordered a lot of food. Expect a single entree to fill up even the hungriest of diner.\nValue: $10 for the Avocado Toast. $13 for the Huevos Rancheros. $13 for The Tots. $13 for Mel's Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. $13 for the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. $11 for the Cannoli French Toast. \nAmbiance: Sabrina's Cafe has several locations around Philadelphia, but we picked up from the one near the museums. They had a small table out front along the steps, which was set up to take names and to help with take-out. I did not step inside, but it looked like they had a large indoor dining space, though it had restricted capacity. In an alley along the side of the building, not even directly adjacent to the restaurant, they had set up a nice outdoor area. I assume it is only temporary, but it looked great and much more appealing than what I saw of inside.\nCrowd: We ordered our meal to-go, but most guests were dining-in, both indoor and outdoor. There was a 20 minute wait for Saturday brunch, and I assume that was actually light for the weekend.\nService: The staff was super helpful and even though our order was large and the restaurant was busy, the estimated time was spot on. \nParking: Street parking out front and a large parking lot less than a block away.", "date": "2020-10-28 23:21:22", "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user": {"review_count": 1631, "average_stars": 3.39, "yelping_since": "2016-01-01 17:41:02"}}

This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet. The hostess was nice too.\n\nI'd come back.", "date": "2019-10-27 13:04:13", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"review_count": 4333, "average_stars": 3.74, "yelping_since": "2009-01-25 04:35:42"}}

Brunch is usually associated with the weekend and a gab fest a la Sex and the City. And the wonderful thing about brunch is there are only so many ways to cook eggs, pancakes, French toast, and waffles, which means it's pretty difficult for the chef to really mess it up. But that also means there's a small margin of error. The line between average fare and something more interesting / spectacular is therefore very fine. \n\nNow onto Sabrina's. Everyone and their moms talk up Sabrina's like it's Philadelphia's answer to brunch, when in fact Sabrina's notoriety is gained due to the sad void of competing bruncheries, especially in the center city / callowhill area. So, after a year in Philadelphia, I've realized that Sabrina'a gets its reputation for \"best brunch ever\" by default. I find the food at Sabrina's to be pretty pedestrian, and not really deserving of the title of best brunch ever. But of course it's still vastly superior to IHoP or Denny's. \n\nI've been to Sabrina's twice. The first time I had the stuffed French toast. I admit that I should have paid better attention to the menu description and asked for the maple syrup on the side instead of it getting drizzled directly onto a dish which I felt was sweet enough. It was my first time eating stuffed French toast and I just wasn't a fan. My friends ordered a sandwich with the Parmesan fries, a stuffed French toast with strawberries, and eggs benedict (or some sort of poached egg). Well, I've never met a potato I didn't like so I do like the home fries. And I love that the coffee comes in these homestyle mugs so you kinda feel like you're just eating brunch at a friend's. Which is a facade the servers keep up with their friendly service.\n\nThe second time I went, I got the breakfast burrito, and it was just a little too dry for me. But the service is consistently friendly. \n\nOverall, Sabrina's is decent but not worth the long wait on the weekends.

Another ZOMG experience!\n\nI can't believe it took us this long to give Manakeesh a try. We had past by it so many times, and I had wondered about it. Having \"bakery\" in their title is a little deceiving. I was under the impression that it was a place for deserts and maybe breads, but not so much for a meal. Boy was I wrong.\n\nI started with this orange and cream, creamsicle like, tasting drink. It was pretty tasty. Although, it was way better when it was full then it was once it was drained and the ice started melting in it. For some reason, it didn't maintain the perfect flavor from start to finish. And, I did not take long to suck it down.\n\nNext, I had the Shawarma Manakeesh with salad added. I was really glad I added the salad. I did not realize it, but Manakeesh is a large pita like bread folded like a taco and stuffed with the filling of your choice. In this case, it was filled with Shawarma. Had I not added salad, it would have been a meat with some onions and tomatoes and not much else sandwich. Adding the salad was key. All this said, it was awesome. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. I practically devoured this monster sized taco in ten minutes.\n\nMy wife got Veggie Manakeesh and added hummus. She really enjoyed it too.\n\nWe also shared a side of Baba Ghannouj. It was made to perfection. It was so tasty. $3.75 for the portion we got was a little more than it should be, but it's hard to complain considering the quality and how inexpensive the Manakeesh  sandwiches were.\n\nThen, there was the deserts. We got a little crazy. We decided to share three deserts. We got the Black Forrest Cake, Tiramisu, and an eclair with strawberries in the middle looking desert. Now, these are not what you would expect, as they have a middle eastern flair/interpretation to them. The Tiramisu was okay, a little disappointing only because I like the traditional style so much and this did not live up to it. It wasn't bad though. The eclair thing was pretty good, but also not great. The Black Forrest, however, was the real winner. The cake was moist and tasty. The cream in it was nearly perfect. The fruit, which was not your typical raspberry, was great. I think it was mango and something else, but I am not certain. But whatever, it was awesome. And the chocolate sprinkled on it was delish.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent spot and I will be back many times.", "date": "2012-05-02 16:03:23", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 493, "average_stars": 3.44, "yelping_since": "2011-05-04 18:02:07"}}

This past week, I finally made my way over, and thank god I did!  (I have been there twice since :) )\n\nManakeesh is a cozy little cafe-like bakery making FRESH from scratch Lebanese baked goods and foods.  They serve Turkish Coffee and other espresso/coffee/tea drinks too.  The menu includes some appetizers, Lebanese flat breads and wraps, and a few platters.  In addition to the main cafe room at Manakeesh, there is a connecting small Middle-Eastern grocery shop with a full smoothie & crepe bar.  OMG.\n\nThe first time I was at Manakeesh, I ordered the Turkish Coffee.  It is very strong coffee with Cardamom.  It was served piping hot and was delicious.  I also got a to-go order of the Tabbouleh.  The small is pretty big and was less than $4.  It was full of fresh bright green parsley, amazing.\n\nI had to come back to Manakeesh with my fiance- Middle Eastern food is one of his favorites so it was only right to bring him back and get the full experience.  We ordered the Za'tar Flatbread (with veggies: cucumber, tomato, onion, olives) and we each got a platter- he picked the Chicken Schwarma and I got the Beef Schwarma.  The platters each came with hummus, salad, fresh pita bread, and the meat was served over a very large bed of rice.  We could have just ordered one- it was a ton of food.  \n\nThe Za'tar flatbread was outstanding.  I highly recommend trying it, especially if you haven't heard of Za'tar yet.  Get it with or without the veggies- I'm sure both ways are fantastic.  Everything here is cooked in an open-flame oven which gives the bread an amazing smoky flavor.  \n\nThe platters were also seriously awesome.  The meat was super flavorful and very tender.  I don't typically like to fill up on rice, but this rice was delicious and worth it.  The hummus was a bit oily for what I prefer but of course it tasted amazing.  I also enjoyed the salad, it was light but had some fresh pita chips sprinkled over top which was a nice touch.  The pita unfortunately came out about 4 minutes after our platters, so I took mine home since it was so big anyway.  It made for a perfect late-night snack that night- still probably the best pita bread I've had outside of Israel.  \n\nThis place is legit.  It's the real deal.

It was not the easiest of groups to manage, I suppose, by nevertheless...\n\nThe hummus and baba ghanoush made a great opening act.  The bread came out hot, and piping fresh.  But then the server came back and TOOK AWAY a piece of bread!  He gave us 1 too many apparently.  And he took one away just as my friend was tearing into it!  Weird, right?  I mean, fine, maybe you should only get 2.  But it's bread, not truffles!  And PS, bread adds $1 onto the price of each of these; if you hold your horses, you can use the bread of your manakeesh and forego extra. \n\nThen the manakeesh started flowing, and the server just kind of put them down without explaining which was which, leaving us all to fend for ourselves in figuring out who got what and whose was whose.  It was finally sorted, and I will say that the chicken tawook was my favorite.  Moist chicken, great garlic sauce.  The hot cheese and red peppers was pretty disappointing in the lack of cheese.  The lamb lahm bajeen was also tasty.  Falafel was solid.  Then we realized two orders of labneh never came.  So we went to ask for them, and then they arrived.  \n\nPretty much everyone got a fresh lemonade ($4) as well.  They came, without ICE!  Apparently they were out of ice... so so much for our thirst quenching, cold lemonade.  It comes with a free refill, as well, so there was ice in time for that as they ran out to get some.  But two ice cubes in the refill didn't really cool me down.

It's a bit different than I remember. There's a juice shop add-on where the soda fountains were. I actually tried to come back sooner but they were closed for Ramadan. So after looking over the menu, I was set on trying some different things that caught my eye. This is what I had... chicken shwarma, chai tea hot, basboosa, and a napolean to go. I had a yelp deal and that stuff came to $20... just over it with tax.\n\nHere's why I'm giving 3 stars again. I learned my lesson from the last time, but they didn't. The service was awkward. I said that I wanted a shwarma and just like before I wasn't asked what I wanted on it. I also said that I wanted some desserts so I walked over to the other side. The woman just stayed at the register. I had to flag her down and wave for her to come over. After I chose what I wanted and paid up. I watched the guy making the food (he was stellar) and again I noticed all of the vegetables. So I asked him what comes on the shwarma. He told me and I told him what I wanted... instead. Done deal. I went outside to grab a table. My shwarma came out, but my tea didn't. I had to go back in and ask for my tea. She flat out forgot.\n\nThe shwarma itself was pretty good. It was my first time trying it. It looked a bit different than what I had seen elsewhere, but it's not a big deal. I definitely want to try some other varieties. The basboosa (semolina cake?) was good... thick and syrupy. It had an interesting texture... a lot like cornmeal. The tea was alright, but I thought it was a bit over priced for the small cup. But I do know chai costs a bit more. Now for the napolean... I waited maybe an hour and half to eat it. And the top layer was so hard it bent up my plastic fork. I had to really let it sit in my hot kitchen for a couple of hours for it to soften up. When it finally did I really liked it, but it was mushed up from earlier. Did they give it to me frozen? What if I wanted to eat it right away?\n\nAlso, there were indeed paper towels in the bathroom this time. Other than that, a couple brought their dogs to the outdoor patio. I didn't appreciate that at all. Period. Not to mention some woman parked her double baby stroller in front of the patio doors and walked away.

Honestly, I really felt Manakeesh was lacking on almost all fronts. \n\nI'll start with some positives.  This place is clean (front of house, at least).  Things are organized and there does seem to be a sense of calm.  The girl at the cashier was nice.  Very hospitable.  Cute, too.\n\nI got the schwarma because I thought it would be a nice introduction, culinarily, to the restaurant.  There are a lot of places in the immediate area doing schwarmas.  Obviously, you have to make it really good if you want it to stand out, right?  \n\nManakeesh's interpretation of a schwarma is a pretty bad.  The \"marinated sirloin strips\" was actually more like coarsely ground beef.  It had a most bizarre texture.  There was also a problem with the flavor - there was none.  I don't think they use any salt in their cooking.  Very bland.  No soulfulness.  No deep flavors I've come to expect from true middle eastern eateries.  \n\nThe \"garnish\" of the schwarma were some bitter white onions and some slimey tomatoes that looked like they had been cut last weekend.  I guess the parsley was a nice touch, but it was too little too late.  \n\nAs for the flatbread, there was no life to it.  I had the sense that no cook there had given the dough the love it so badly needs.  Also, the dough was still a little raw on the inside.  \n\nI could really only stomach about half a sandwich.  Every bite just got progressively worse.  I was waiting for that bite where everything made sense.  \n\nI had made the mistake of ordering the \"cheesecake\" while I ordered the sandwich, so that's how I was gonna finish the meal.  This \"cheesecake\" was unlike any cheesecake I've ever had before.  The texture was that of a six month old tasty cake.  WAY too sweet.  Not soft, rich and luscious how I know my cheesecakes to be.

Like an amazing thin fresh pita. If you like things spicy, add a little sriracha. I haven't tried the vegetarian options, but I can't imagine anything on these delicious breads being bad. There is even a nutella one. \n\nEat in if you can.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the employees are great and hospitable.  You order at the register, and they give you a number to bring to your table. A very short wait later (considering they make the flatbread fresh!), the nicest lady ever brings your food to the table. If you must take out, eat at home because this is table food - some of the meat ones are kind of greasy in a delicious gyro sort of way.\n\nThis place is extremely cheap too. The meat manakeesh range in price from $4-$5 (except the shaved prime rib and you should skip that one anyway), and they are really filling. Both my brother and boyfriend were full from eating one, and I could hardly finish mine. It's a great deal.\n\nThere are a variety of desserts. I've tried a few types of baklavah, which run about a dollar a piece for a 2-bite piece, which is a very decent price and the perfect size after a filling manakeesh. All the types I've tried were good, but not amazing. I'm a little confused by all the other desserts though bc they are not well labeled. I guess it doesn't matter to me though, because after a manakeesh, I'm too full for dessert anyway.", "date": "2011-05-03 19:24:25", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 4, "average_stars": 3.0, "yelping_since": "2010-09-07 02:20:02"}}

Labanese pizza?!  I love love LOVE pizza, so I was intrigued. \n\nOrdered the Lamb Lahm Bajeen Manakeesh, Spinach and Cheese Manakeesh, and the Gluten Free Platter that comes with hummus, baba ghannoush, falafel, fattoush, and grape leaves.\n\nDelivery was faster than expected which was an awesome surprise since I was starving.  The estimated delivery time was about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes, but delivery arrived around 45 mins.  Awesome!\n\nNow this is where they lose stars.  They deliver their flatbreads, folded in half.  So it's more like a quesadilla than a pizza.  I would recommend that maybe they could invest in some recyclable pizza boxes for their Manakeesh items, so these could be delivered flat.  I was able to unfold the lamb one, but the spinach and cheese was a fail because all the toppings ended up on one side.  Definitely disappointed by this.\n\nI did like the flavors/spices in the lamb.  The spinach and cheese was nothing spectacular to report.  Also, the platter was pretty standard.  I've definitely had better falafel and I had to reheat them since all the other items of the platter were cold which made the falafel arrive cold as well.  Enjoyed the baba ghannoush and the stuffed grape leaves. \n\nAll in all, I would have rather ordered an amazing pizza from somewhere else and be more content with that, then with what I've sampled from here, especially if you compare that with the money that was spent on the above.  \nI won't be ordering delivery again, but would be up to  going and having a sit-down meal at this spot.", "date": "2015-03-31 15:25:55", "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 241, "average_stars": 4.08, "yelping_since": "2010-02-20 21:50:54"}}

We wanted to add an order of falafel to our order of a chicken shwarma platter and a beef shwarma platter. The owner made a joke, I guess, and said maybe next time when I'm not using a yelp deal I could come back and get some because they were all out. This made me extremely uncomfortable. If he didn't want to honor the promotion, why did he sign up for it? This was the first time I ever used a yelp deal, and made me feel like I was cheap or something. Of course, a large line piled up behind us and I felt responsible for holding other people up.\n\nThe food itself was not very good. The chicken and beef shwarmas seemed to have different spices and a lot of ginger in the beef. I didn't like it that much because all of the meat was like chopped in little teeny tiny pieces. I mean minuscule, chopped, tiny pieces. I was hoping the chicken shwarma would have been like the chicken that is sliced off of the spit. The salad was ok, the hummus ok, and the large portion of basmati rice really dwarfed the meat even further. The portion of beef was significantly less than the chicken. It was somewhat funny that my boyfriend and I sat picking at the chicken, thinking it was beef, until the beef came out. The beef had a tangy, vinegary flavor. I really did not like either.

I had an intense hankering for baklava, but there are so few places in CC that actually make baklava for take out. A Yelp search brought me to Manakeesh Cafe & Bakery, and although its location is quite out of the way, my yoga classes on the weekend bring me far enough into the area that I decided to make a side trip there before heading home. \n\nThe large cafe and bakery is designed so that it looks like two different sections/businesses, with the cafe on one side and the dessert-y, smoothie, ice cream bar area on the other. I quickly spotted the sweets I was after since they are displayed right at the cafe's counter, and after a bit of a wait since this is a popular place, I ordered almost one of every single type of baklava and sweet that I saw. It was quite a large order, but we were having friends over so I figured it was safer to get more and then people can choose what to eat (and I would get the leftovers ;D). Our little party had fun trying things (I was shocked that someone had never had baklava before!):\n\nSemolina cake: this almond semolina cake was very dense and sweet, especially with the sweet sugar syrup that's poured on top. The almond flavor is very light and complements the semolina perfectly.\nPhyllo sweet cheese pastry (can't remember the name of it): yummy! The shredded phyllo itself was not very sweet, but it adds a great crunch, and the sweet cheese filling was delicious. The piece they cut was topped with a dollop of more of the filling with pistachio pieces on top.\nMalmouls: the pistachio one had a mellow toasted pistachio filling, and the semolina shortbread was still a bit moist and corn cookie-like. The sweet date filled one was delicious, too. The walnut one had a very pronounced toasted walnut flavor - it was so good, it might be my favorite, and I had assumed pistachio would be since I love that little green nut so much...\nAssorted baklava: these were absolutely delicious, not soaked in honey the way most baklava you encounter is, and the phyllo dough is super light, flaky, and buttery. All of the different toasted nuts were finely ground and held their own flavor against the sweet honey. Some of the best baklava I've ever had.

I was excited to try out the restaurant, but was cautious because a few friends whose opinions I really respect had given them 3-star reviews. My experience was absolutely 5-star caliber. \n\nThe menu is extensive. I'd checked it out online before heading in and still was somewhat overwhelmed by all of the options. So that you can reduce the awkwardness of staring above the head of the guy at the counter, they have printed menus available. The cashier was also very helpful for suggesting what we might want to eat. I went with Lauren S, and on her recommendation we decided to share hummus, the shawarma manakeesh, and the honey manakeesh. The shawarma manakeesh was the least exciting of the things we received - it was fine, but not exciting enough that I would order it again. But oh my goodness was everything else delicious. The hummus had great flavor - almost a little lemony. The small was the perfect size to share among the two of us and was served with warm flatbread. I knew we still had 2 flatbreads to go but could not stop eating this. The honey manakeesh was delicious. I would seriously eat this for any meal - breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, 2am drunk food, whatever. It is delicious sweet cream and honey wrapped in warm flatbread and I want to ask it to marry me. \n\nAfter all of that, we still managed to find room for dessert ... rather, about 6 desserts. During our meal we were tantalized by the display of many different pastries. When we walked up to order we were again stricken by the paralysis of a million delicious options. The owner very patiently answered every single one of our questions, which all boiled down to, \"What is this? What does it taste like? Do we want to eat it? Do we want to eat it more than the thing you just told us about which sounded delicious?\" Because we have no impulse control we basically ordered everything that looked good. It was all delicious. I couldn't tell you what everything was called so just point at whatever strikes your fancy and eat it, you won't go wrong. \n\nI have to mention that one of the highlights of our meal was the owner's son - who looks to be around 9 years old and was helping serve food when we visited. He was absolutely charming and helpful, bringing us our food, checking to make sure we didn't need anything, and happily discussing dinner and dessert choices with us.

I really wanted to give them a chance considering how popular they are in Philly.\n\nThe last time we were there, my family and I came over for dinner and we decided that each of us was going to order something different on the menu. In the end, we ordered Kafta Kebab, Chicken Tawook, Chicken Shawarma, and the Beef Shawarma. We also ordered a cheese and a zaatar manakeesh.\n\nThere seemed to be an event going on that day because It was pretty packed. We suffered through the long line until it was time to order. I appreciated the fact that they let me know ahead of time the wait time for the food was going to be about 45 mins. Nonetheless, I was impressed that they were able to get the food out 30 mins later.\n\nNow the food. Both of the shawarmas were terrible. The meat was dry, and the lamb specifically tasted like it was made out of rubber. The Chicken Tawook and the Kafta were pretty good, though I've had better. \n\nWe also had some Muhammara and Baba Ghanouj with our platters. Being a baba fanatic, I would say their Baba was not bad at all. It was a good balance between the smokey flavor and the eggplant. The Muhammara, though, was just awful and did not taste like traditional Muhammara at all. Word of advice: if a place isn't run by Syrians, don't bother trying the Muhammara. \n\nBut I will say this: their Manakeesh was probably the best thing we had on the menu. And the pitas that were served with the food did really taste like it was baked fresh. Knowing they consider themselves a bakery, I would have been heavily disappointed if their Manakeesh didn't live up to their name.\n\nAnd finally the Knafeh I had for dessert. It seemed that they had taken it out of the oven and left it out in the open for a long period of time because it was cold. Nonetheless, it wasn't bad.\n\nSo would I come back another time? Maybe.

I'd been stalking you on Facebook and Yelp, ogling your flatbread sandwiches and exotic sweets. Yesterday afternoon, when I saw a \"now deal\" on Groupon, I decided that the day had finally come to taste your Lebanese wonders. So I grabbed the groupon and a good friend, and I headed across the river to West Philly.\n\nThey have two outdoor seating areas: one in the front, as well as a patio on the side. The interior is open and airy (the building was formerly a bank), with Arabic designs decorating the exposed brick walls. They really did a great job with the space. It's lovely and welcoming.\n\nFrom the equally welcoming staff, I ordered the following:\n\n-Veggie manakeesh: possibly my favorite of the manakeesh...es.\n\n-Lahm bajeen manakeesh: ground beef with tomato; second favorite. This one and the veggie would be good ones to try first if you're new to this type of food, because they have familiar flavors.\n\n-Kafta manakeesh: ground beef with lamb and parsley. For me, this one fell under the \"glad I tried it, but wouldn't necessarily order it again\" category.\n\n-Honey manakeesh: this, presumably because of the liquid-y nature of the toppings, came wrapped up instead of flat. It's basically a hoagie-shaped wrap of fluffy bread filled with honey and \"sweet cream\" (tasted similar to ricotta) that you eat like a giant sandwich, while getting honey freakin' everywhere, like a slob. (Or that might just be me.) My Iraqi friend tells me that back home, this was a standard breakfast for him. I can confirm that it makes a lovely accompaniment to one's morning tea, because I had my leftover half this morning. The honey provides just enough sweetness without pushing it all the way into dessert territory. (They use raw honey, as well.) Love!\n\n-Sfeeha: mini meat pie, which you can order individually or by the half-dozen/dozen. Adorable and delicious.\n\n-Fatayer: mini spinach pie. Same deal as above; almost as adorable and delicious.\n\n-Some type of sweet cake that I cannot remember the name of.\n\n-pot of tea, which is served in a stainless steel footed teapot on a tray with two small glasses, one mint leaf in each.

But now it occurs to me... if it's too hot to touch, it's probably too hot to drink. Hm. Makes a lot of sense, actually.)\n\nSo I had quite the mid-east feast on my first visit, but there is still a ton of stuff I want to try. (Nutella manakeesh with banana and hazelnut shavings?!

I got a couple of honey glazed things. One looked like silly puddy molded into a baby pine cone. It had an interesting taste... really sweet. I'm not sure I liked it that much for a dollar. I also tried a chewy near eastern yet distant relative of the funnel cake and that was pretty good. For a dollar, I would've preferred a bit more heft in it.\n\nOk, so to the Sujuk! I placed my order, paid up, and went to wash my hands. STRIKE 1: The bathroom was nice, but with no paper towels I wasn't a happy camper. So then I came out and my food was being delivered to the territory I staked my life on over in the corner. I got a cup and proceeded to the open air fountain. No matter what kind of food a restaurant is selling... having free refills is \"first base\" as far as I'm concerned. And the drinks were of the Pepsi persuasion.\n\nNo really, to the Sujuk! The spice on it opened my nose up and it tasted pretty good, but I'm thinking... something is missing here and I don't know what it is. STRIKE 2: They didn't ask me what I wanted on it! I could've gotten all sorts of veggies and sauces or whatever. I just made do with sriracha at the counter since I ate half of it before I figured something was up. (the other option was ketchup)\n\nThis would be strike 3 if it happened to me, but it was someone else.

Why three times, instead of my usual pre-review requirement of two? Well...in spite of all the other adoring reviews, and in spite of the fact that Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite, I just wasn't having great luck with my orders, until this past Friday. \nSo let's start with the best, and work back to most disappointing;\nOn Friday I ordered a grape leaves wrap for dinner. I knew that I really liked their stuffed grape leaves (or, as known by their Greek name, dolmades) and how can you go wrong with fattoush salad (hold the onions!) and baba ghanoush? Well, they forgot to hold the onions, but they did call me not 5 minutes after my pick-up to apologize and offer to replace the whole meal. I told them not to worry, and I was glad I did (the onions were few and easy to pick out anyway). It was a really great wrap, and a perfect portion. Flavorful and filling, but not too much so. My partner got the falafel platter, which he really liked, but the massive hummus portion packs a punch - you might not want to finish it in a single sitting. \nSo I knew I liked the stuffed grape leaves thanks to the ma'ali platter. That was from visit number two. Sadly, that was the only thing I completely enjoyed from that meal (which I shared with my partner, together with a cheese manakeesh). The fried cauliflower, eggplant and potatoes were tasty enough, but so loaded down with oil that I really didn't feel great soon after. As for the cheese manakeesh...I just don't get it. What am I missing?\nMy first visit was the biggest disappointment. I ordered the cheese and spinach manakeesh. The spinach was so briny I could barely eat it. I guess I was expecting a more Greek-style cheese-spinach blend, and this was not that. I mean, I love pickled cucumbers, but Manakeedh goes super heavy on vinegar and pickled foods, at least on everything I've had.\nNot the most glowing review, and it really feels more like 3.5 than 4 stars, but I gave the full 4 because the service is great, very quick, friendly and mindful, and everyone else I've gone with has really enjoyed their food.

However checking in on Yelp yields a 5% off purchase coupon.\n\nFood:\n-The portions are huge and easily shared\n-The pita is made to order and very delicious \n-Everyone in the group enjoyed their order.\n-The bakery's menu looked delicious but sadly most items were out of stock. \n\nWith all the positives listed above, you may be wondering why the three star review.

And do your best to avoid having to use the restaurant restroom. You will thank me later. \n-Cutlery, napkins, and water are self served.  However the water cups are TINY (like 4 sips) so be prepared to refill often or (what I recommend) bring your own refillable water bottle/cup. \n-Street parking only\n-There is a small section stocked with different items such as honey, Turkish delight, nuts, candy, etc. \n-Manakeesh has their own app for you to place delivery orders and get discounts from", "date": "2021-06-26 12:37:04", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 71, "average_stars": 3.78, "yelping_since": "2010-05-04 22:47:11"}}

The decor is better than the worthy competitor of fellow Lebanese competitor Saad's (across the street). I usually order the Lebanese Beef platter w muhammarah  Nd the fatoosh salad. Yesterday I ordered the shish tawook platter for variety and my dining partner ordered the Beef. Our platters and Pepsis cost just over $40 w tax. After a few minutes, yhe platters came out and we were politely told by a diminutive, bearded cashier, the pita would follow. The pita did not follow. When asked about the pita 10-15 minutes and waiting in live for the privilege to again speak to said diminutive cashier, the cashier acted as though he had never seen me. I remarked that if platters cost $20 with a drink, they should include pita. He reaponded woth a blank stare. O returned to my seat and waited for the pita. None came. The cashier pretended he could not see me as I stared it him in astonishement. I returned to the cashier, dining room and rush completely. No excise for bad service at this point and the platters empty. My dining partner looking at warm babaganoush. I again inquired aboit the pita. Again a blank stare. I requested to speak to the manager. The cashier yhen remarked \"GOOD! Easier for me!  After another ten minutes the manager came out. A young man in his twenties w red hair. Polite. He explained that the cashier \"did not understand...\"thought you had left\"and was \"new in the country\". Perhaps he should not deal with paying customers in that case. I returned to me seat to see if Manakeesh jas any management integrity. They do. Finally after about a total of an hour i was offered pita to go in bag. By then, the $40 lunch for two was OVER and I was simply seeking some sort of satisfaction re the poor service from the cashier. Instated that I had no interest in pita at that point. I was offered some baklava which was a decent attempt to appease. I declined stating that I was not seeking a freebie, that I had come expecting the usual great food and acceptable service and been disappointed.

If you are familiar with the place you will know that the cashier area and the brick oven area (where they make the manakish) are next to each other, and the cashier was constantly talking to the chefs responsible for the brick oven area. While one of the chefs was wearing a mask during our visit, the other one was putting his mask on and off every time he wants to talk, laugh, or interact with the cashier. Which defeats the purpose of the mask. Everyone that was coming out from the back kitchen was not wearing a mask either. They had a ceramic wrap on the counter which is a very poor attempt at having some sort of shield (similar to what you see at grocery stores) since it would not even reach the hight of any average-sized human. The purpose of covering the counter area is to protect both workers and customers, having this wrap way below one's head where anything coming from your mouth will easily land on the other side is pointless. Lastly, the person responsible for bagging the food was constantly touching his face and hair while bagging everything. \nIf you care for your safety I would not recommend this place, especially during this pandemic.

The examples:\n\nService - The hostess came by and greeted me by name because she just saw that I checked in on Foursquare. At first I felt mildly stalked and partially embarrassed that someone just called me out (in a good way?) for checking in, but she was actually very nice and I was busy checking in on Yelp when she said that so I couldn't be too embarrassed about using a completely meaningless feature in a city where I would never receive a tiny crown for my e-friendliness. Other than my new friend, the service was average.\n\nFood - I ordered the curry chicken salad tartine which comes open faced on five small pieces of rye bread. The sandwich tasted pretty decent and certainly looked appetizing, but my one issue with it was that if you are going to make an open face sandwich on a small piece of rye bread, you can't put so much curry chicken salad on each piece that when you try to pick it up with one hand it bends and falls from the weight of its own girth. This happened, but I ate the entire sandwich so it obviously didn't bother me so much.\n\nPrices - TOO HIGH. Everything I looked at on the menu for lunch made me say to myself, \"Self, that doesn't sound worth it.\" And then out of nowhere there was something for $7.95 (a seaweed salad), but of course to put tofu or something else in it, it was $3 more bucks. You can't eat for $10, lunch is going to run you $15 and it's frankly just not good enough for that. Again though, I cleaned my plate.\n\nAmbiance - This is actually a cool place inside and much larger than you would think from the outside. Tons of wood block tables, menus sitting on top, nice variety of long communal tables with two-tops and four-tops.

What amazed me the most is that the coffee was room temperature.  It is very strong so we asked for hot water on the side which we were given at no extra charge.\n\n2. Croissant -  I wanted to order some kind of egg sandwich...but they don't have that for breakfast!  I could order an omelet for $12 and then pay for additional bread, but the bread is not toasted.  The waitress said that since their bread is made every day...they don't toast it.  Uhm...does that make sense?  I ordered a $4 croissant which was good, but certainly not worth $4!\n\n3. Baguette- I wanted to give it 100% chance of success, so I noticed that the baguette was today's special...although I was there for breakfast, I figured this Belgium based restaurant would do an excellent job. I first thought of getting the ham and cheese baguette, but the waiter suggested I get the parmesan version.  So I agreed.  About 5 minutes later, she serves me a sandwich which for $8 has been the most incredibly waste of money.  It was a short piece of baguette with a slide of cold ham and cold cheese, amazingly even the bread was refrigerator cold.  I figure it took 10 seconds to put this masterpiece together.  No sauce, no olive oil, no salt or pepper, just literary 3 ingredients slapped together. It tasted just as it sounds.  It turns out, she brought me the wrong sandwich!  Then she corrected it and brought me the recommended  parmesan version...I figured, this one will be much better.  Amazingly it was 99.99% the same thing!

I live next door so this is the perfect one stop shop for all my artisanal needs. I love their organic coffee. I am a nurse and a patient of mine raved about how this was the only place they knew of where they could get organic coffee, so of course I made sure to buy them some before one of my shifts and they were in heaven. I think their coffee is absolutely delicious and I really enjoy their lattes/cappuccinos as well. \n\nI love their food. Everything I have ever had there is great. It is quite pricey, however, if you are willing to spend a little money for a delicious meal, it's worth it. The tartines they serve, which is basically a large piece of bread with a spread on it, are absolutely delicious! I am in love with the ricotta, fig, apple, and honey one. The only downside is they are around 12-13 dollars for that one large piece of bread with a spread on it. I am unimpressed with the avocado one, it was basically the same large piece of bread but with an avocado spread and about four small piece of avocado on top. Again, around 12-13 dollars for that. Everything else I have ever had there has definitely been worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing and beautiful, it makes you feel as if you are in a european cafe. I couldn't believe it is a chain. It reminds me of a much much nicer au bon pain. \n\nI have been there quite a few times so I am reviewing all of my experiences and there was one particular experience that left me feeling uncomfortable. My parents had come to town for the day and I wanted to take them there for a light afternoon drink of champagne and a snack. When we were seated our server came over and took our order. He was new and had a thick french accent. Another server delivered our champagne and mentioned that our original server was unable to do so due to religious beliefs in regards to alcohol. It was a bit confusing but I guess due to that fact, he really didn't check in with us at all. I honestly felt a little uncomfortable because I knew just drinking the champagne was offending the person who was serving us. I have no issues with religious and cultural beliefs, I just think that it is difficult to work and serve at an establishment that offers alcohol if you cannot touch or handle alcoholic beverages. It was difficult to get his attention throughout our meal and we ended up having to go to the counter to get our check. \n\nI also use their app and order coffee to go, however, on more than one occasion when I arrive to pick up my order, they haven't made it yet or don't know what I am talking about. They seem to miss the orders that print automatically from their computer system. \n\nOtherwise, I love it here, I go here to study and eat and catch up with friends and I will continue to do so.", "date": "2017-03-05 09:51:14", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"review_count": 114, "average_stars": 3.97, "yelping_since": "2013-08-20 20:01:19"}}

Then I could just make a funny face (mouth open to seventeen times the normal size, eyes bugged out with little springs boing-boinging them right out) and have the word, \"ARRRGHHHH!!!\" in big print above my head in a quote bubble, and that would indeed say it all.   Unfortunately, I can't really make that face (without a lot of plastic surgery and going blind) and have to do a little better than \"ARRRGHHHH!!!\"  Darn it that I'm not a cartoon.\n\nTwo colleagues and I went to this location for lunch and seated ourselves (as the sign indicated).  The place was already quite crowded so we took the big shared table in the small room in the front.  Almost immediately, a few other parties came and sat down with us at the table.  After about ten minutes, two of those parties walked out due to bad service/non-responsive service.\n\nWe browsed the menus as well as the specials on the board.  It was just a few minutes after noon, so none of us expected that any of the lunch specials had already run out, but such was the case with half of them.  Everything we ordered had an issue right from the beginning:  stuff ran out, ingredients were not available, things like that.  One of us ordered an item that she usually gets for take-out.  She was told that she could not have that item at the table, that it was a take-out item only and ready-made.  She was told she could get the closest thing on the menu to it, but it had half the ingredients and was way more expensive.  (And no, our server would not let her purchase the item as take-out and then bring it to the table.)  The three of us continued to scour the menu to find lunches that were available.  This was not easy, as it seemed that everything we happened to pick was already gone, or not what we thought.  \n\nWe finally place our orders and we think there's a light at the end of the tunnel (as in, we were starving at this point and couldn't wait to eat!)  A lot of time goes by and our server barely made eye contact with us as he tended to the folks around us.  Refills on our waters were very hard to come by, and we had to ask for bread three times.  Then the bread came with one of the jams completely empty.  We asked for the refill on jam four times and it never came.  Frustrating, because I was really looking forward to trying the raspberry jam.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes with no food, someone from the kitchen came over to the table and asked who ordered the cobb salad (me).  I was informed that they ran out of eggs, and was asked if I wanted a substitution.  I basically had ordered the salad because of the egg, so I told her I would have to look at the menu for a new item.  A minute later, she came back and said she found an egg after all.\n\nAfter another 15 minutes (still with no water refills and none of that elusive jam!) my salad came (with no egg) and only one of the other orders.  Finally, my other colleague's entree came and it appeared to have an ingredient on it that was not advertised (mayonnaise).  She asked our server to check and see if there was mayo on there and he acted like she was insane, and took his time coming back with the answer, which delayed things considerably for her (she doesn't eat mayo, and that's totally her right to want to check. I would have done the same thing, as a fellow mayo-hater.)\n\nWe finally were able to all start eating our meals when the server came over with two hard-boiled eggs on a plate for me.  At this point I just had to laugh.  I was thankful they did bring the eggs (guess they found two hiding somewhere!) because the salad was pretty bland without it (there was hardly any chicken and the avocado was mostly browned and inedible).  I've never been given hard boiled eggs with a salad that I had to cut myself (except at a salad bar, and even then, most times it's cut up for you), but I wasn't going to complain.  I got the last eggs!  \n\nThe most ridiculous part of the experience though was the attitude of our server.  We had to ask questions because things were not available, including daily specials (who would think they'd run out by noon?), and because items were not given to us (like water refills and bread and jam).  Not only did he seemingly forget a lot of things, but he put on quite an act when he was talking to us (spoke to us in a very sing-song voice, smothering us in niceness) and then making faces (rolling eyes, etc.) when he thought we weren't looking.   Sadly, he did this to our table neighbors, too.  (One woman's entree came drenched in dressing and she had specifically asked for no dressing, as she is diabetic.  He actually argued with her and said that the dressing will be on the side, but that what she saw on her plate was part of the \"pre-made slaw\" which happens to be dressed.  She then reiterated that she specifically asked for no dressing on the salad at all and he said he'd be right back with the side of dressing.)\n\nFood good.

I don't do many reviews on this site or others, but when I come across an establishment that is just terrible in either quality of food or service, I just have to warn others and here I am about to slam a place I used to love.\n\nYUP, Le Pain Quotidien, The Daily Bread, will no longer be one of my Go-To places when I'm in Philadelphia and I'm sure I'll be sharing this story with my fellow crewmembers on our long flight home.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I'm gonna hate writing this because Le Pain Quotidien, located at 1425 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA, has rapidly deteriorated in service over the past few months.  Quality of food and drink remain the same, good to great, but their service is absolutely dismal.\n\nI was seated in messy and dirty environment and it appeared as if I just missed the morning breakfast crowd.  Most tables were still littered with the remnants of a morning meal.  Where is the \"cleaning crew\" I wondered?   After looking around the place, I started up my laptop, and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait.  After about 10 minutes or so, I decided to start the old stopwatch and start timing.    After 15 minutes on the watch, my waitress, Julia, literally threw the menu on my table and just kept on going.  Kinda startled me because I wasn't looking up, doing the morning email thing.  I knew what I already wanted, so I just moved the menu away from the position where it had originally landed.  After a few minutes later, a gentleman sat next to me.  At around that time Julia returned to my seat and took my order, a Mocha and apple turnover, never looking up and making eye contact with the customer, eyes on her pad, writing like mad, then away she went.....\n\nI was going to tell that guy sitting next to me that he's probably gonna wait a while to be served but much to my surprise, Julia returned to our location and \"handed\" him his menu and welcomed him to Le Pain Quotidien.  Hum, I wondered....?\n\nDid I do something to offend this waitress?  Anyhow, we both waited for our order to arrive.  We were both totally engaged in whatever we were doing on our laptops.  After 30 minutes on the watch, the other guy's order shows up.  A full blown, warm breakfast, with his Caf\u00e9-Whatever.  After 42 minutes on my watch, my Mocha and premade Apple Turnover finally arrived.  By the time it finally got to me, the other guy was nearly finished with his full breakfast.  Before Julia took off again, I stopped her and asked her if I had done something wrong or somehow offended her, wondering to myself if that was the reason why this Philadelphian was so rude to me.  She finally looked up at me, first eye to eye contact, and apologized for the delay and stated that she was the only waitress there.  That was a flat out lie; I saw at least two others.  I asked her but why that other guy's warm breakfast was delivered so much faster than my simple order of coffee and cold cake, and again she apologized and again ran away.\n\nThat was that.  The other guy was in and out in less than about 35 minutes or so and I enjoyed the chaos of Le Pain Quotidien until I finally left; In and out at something over 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I'm sooo glad I wasn't in a rush.\n\nIf you're looking for a clean place with reasonably quick service, this place is hit and miss at best.  It's too bad too because the food is good, but not really worth the drama of a clearly understaffed establishment, with employees who don't know the first thing about treating a customer with respect and courtesy.  Too bad.  Over the past few months, I've noticed a trend at Le Pain Quotidien and it's clearly on the downhill slide.  Maybe they'll turn it around and once again become a favorite of mine, but for now, two thumbs down.\n\nThe Daily Bread: I don't think so.\n\nRant out.", "date": "2013-10-14 17:14:42", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 46, "average_stars": 3.36, "yelping_since": "2009-08-11 05:12:45"}}

I went for Sunday brunch with a friend and it was almost empty! Which was a relief, but slightly unnerving. The prices are very fair, though. \n\nI ordered the Belgian waffle, watermelon refresher, and avocado toast. The Belgian waffle (singular because it only came with one), was a good brunch snack for those who had a bit to eat for breakfast but were still a little hungry. It was different from other BW I had before as it was very sweet, even without syrup. It was a great portion size for how hungry I was. The fresh cream on top of it was one of my favorite parts.\n\nThe watermelon refresher was sweet, but did not taste artificial. It tasted more like watermelon lemonade (very watery), but in a natural way. It went well with the richness of the Belgian waffle. I will say that they did not have many drink options.\nThe avocado toast was alright, my friend and I commented that this was something we could have made at home. It did not have the flare and richness that the other foods had.\n\nThe service structure is odd.

But any positives ended there, within the first few steps in the door.  There were several people waiting to order take-out/waiting for their take-out and it seemed like everyone was in the way, especially myself.  I decided on a ham and gruyere sandwich.  When I told the cashier my order, he was very confused.  I said, \"its right there on the board- baguette sandwiches for take out\" but yet he still didn't know what I was talking about.  Luckily, a co-worker came over and saved us.  There is a very limited menu and this is the first week of being open, so I feel like the staff should know what is offered, especially if its on a huge board, complete with price, on the wall behind them.  I paid the $8.10 for the sandwich and had high hopes for it.  Based on the decor of the place and the price of the sandwich, I thought for sure I was in for a treat.  Wrong.  Completely wrong.  For whatever reason, I thought the sandwich would be warmed (my own assumption).  No, completely cold.  The baguette it was served on was the hardest peice of bread I've tried to bite into.  If I would have been mugged on the way back to my office, the sandwich would have been the perfect self-defense weapon.  All the sandwich had on it was ham, cheese and mustard.  Basic, and I like basic, but for the price I thought it would be all high quality items and heated up.  The gruyere seemed more like a very mild swiss and the ham was nothing special.  It was all very bland.  Luckily there was some mustard for taste.   I didn't feel like possibly breaking a tooth, or cutting up the inside of my mouth, so I opted to eat just the ham and cheese off the sandwich.  So, I paid $8.10 for a few bites of tasteless ham and cheese.  I'll stick to the delicious sandwiches from City Marketplace where there are reasonable prices and plenty of room to make desicions and read the magazines.

I was a bit hungry and settled on getting something before the game. Since I was so close to Morton's, I thought about stopping off there, but realized I should stick to something more casual since I did not want to miss the start of the Eagle's game. Therefore, I decided to go to Le Pain Quotidien. \n\nI came in and was welcomed by the sight of a counter with all sorts of fresh bakery items and an overhead menu to my right and a large dining room straight ahead. The dining room itself was made up of a variety of smaller tables and chairs topped off with a communal table in the middle. Everything was also made out of beautiful wood giving it a nice, charming cafe feel.\n\nSince I was in a bit of a rush, I decided to just get a quick snack from the bakery section rather than sit down. Soon after that, the cashier, who was very nice and polite came over and took my order. Throughout my brief, but pleasurable experience, he described everything that I asked about in great detail. I eventually decided on getting a large Belgian chocolate brownie and a Hazelnut flute and both of them were very solid. The brownie had the perfect level of sweetness and was nice and moist, it just melted right in your mouth. The flute was also very good with a nice hard outside with a touch of flour and a nice soft inside.\n\nAltogether, Le Pain Quotidien offers a great assortment of delicious food and was a great place to stop off before the NFC Championship Game.

When I look up there is phlegm all over the table and the barista is using a towel to, seriously, slop a table full of phlegm into a trash can.

Clearly I'm not in the \"in\" crowd or a friend of the joint because the baristas seemed annoyed that I even placed an order. I remember seeing a posted note that someone wrote to them on the wall saying something to the effect of \"stay tastefully snobby!\" which is probably bad advice. It isn't as if they were being downright rude to me, they just were not at all warm and welcoming. \n\nNext, I've had a coffee, a mocha and a latte, all three were subpar. I mean, I'm a picky bitch when it comes to coffee but so many shops make a good cup in the city, it hits me like a brick when I don't get it.

Sure, I like a diverse crowd, but there always seemed to be at least one asshole just too close to me no matter where I sat. I actually sat outside for one visit because it was a nice day. Two women where behind me, sucking face and spreading their odors my direction.  I mean, it was a noisome hippy cloud of pure \"soap is too conformist\", but I got over it.  I couldn't care less that they were lesbian, and I could overlook the stink, but the conversation was the stake in the heart. I tried to drowned it out but I could hear the one over my headphones! Her conversation was so inane and just flat out ridiculous, I just couldn't focus on anything but her.

They don't want people just hanging out.\" Sweet Jesus, really? I went up to ask if they would turn the power on and they kindly said no.

Descending the stairs, I found another seating area. This one starkly contrasted the airy room above. The walls and ATM machine were scrawled with graffiti (unclear if it was the artistic kind, but if it was, it was most definitely not aesthetically pleasing). The entire basement was unlit, dark, and dreary. I found the bathroom with some effort, at first mistaking it for a broom closet (it was impossible to see what was in there as it was completely pitch black).

I only stopped in because I wanted to check it out as a possible future place to eat breakfast and grab a quick sandwich for work. Also, I order sandwiches and pastries, for monthly meetings I have so I thought this could be a good place to meet that need as well.\nFast forward to today's occurrence. I walked in, it was a blonde chick and an African American male standing chatting, nothing odd about that. I said good morning, and they responded accordingly. I was checking out the sandwich display when another lady walked in. I informed her to go ahead in front of me since I was not ready to order. The man walked away as the blonde took the woman's order. Once she finished with the lady, she saw that I was still looking and said there is a menu over there. I said thanks and walked over to where she pointed to look at the menu. I returned and ordered the egg and cheese sandwich. She said what are you having it on? I replied an Everything Bagel. Her tone was curt, not friendly. So I said let it pass maybe it's me. Then I looked at the sandwich display still thinking maybe this would be a close enough spot from work to hang out for lunch. However, I quickly changed my mind since the blond's tone didn't change. I asked while she was preparing my sandwich are these sandwiches made fresh to order? She said, excuse me or something to that order so I repeated the question. She responded they are already made, we make them. I asked, you make them in the morning? She responded yes. All questions I asked the tattooed blond woman were answered in a monotone voice with no interest on expounding . Needless to say, I will not be visiting that establishment again neither to satisfy  personal or business needs.\nThe blonde's response may not be a big deal to you; however, for me, it is important for any establishment that I spend my hard earned money at to demonstrate good social skills by being courteous and, professional. I don't care if you are pretending, I do desire the business employee or owners to make an effort to be social. \nNow about the sandwich, nothing special about it: I took a bite or two, and for me, it is too much egg. Also, I like my bagel toasted and not simply warmed as she prepared it for me. When I asked her to toast it, she replied it's toasted. I removed all the egg, and I am left with a piece of turkey like the turkey meat I purchase from the deli, cheddar cheese, and an Everything Bagel. Once I finish this review, I am going into the breakroom at my office to toast the Bagel the way I like it and will heat up this one piece of deli turkey. I paid $6.48.

It had the salty cured meats and hard cheese that you find all over Barcelona with some lettuce and aioli on a fresh roll. However, the roll was extremely hard to bite into.

Another was a family of three eating in.  Another was a single sandwich eating in.

Since then I've made a similar sandwich, and it came out almost as good as having someone else make it (admit it, it's better that way).\n\nThe caprese sandwich was simple and light, but came out muddled unfortunately. The mozzarella was pretty fresh, but the tomato juices absorbing into the ciabatta distracted from the balsamic and the basil in the too-garlicky-to-eat-at-work pesto. This effect made it seem like a Spanish inspired sandwich that was missing jamon serrano or something.\n\nI'm glad I gave this caf\u00e9 another shot, since my first choddy experience at the other joint. I recommend this place, as it is a quaint escape from the city.

The menu consists of many sandwiches, with a few other dishes as well, and breakfast options including sandwiches, granola, and some egg dishes. So far, everything I've tasted has been delicious, without anything being too heavy or gluttonous that it'll ruin your day. \n\nThe PLENTY BREAKFAST SANDWICH takes your typical breakfast wich to the next level by piling sausage, eggs, and cheese on a buttery and sweet brioche bun! This wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed having a few bites of my boyfriends. \n\nThe EGG WHITE is my current favorite breakfast sandwich. A lighter take on a breakfast sandwich with flavors I wouldn't expect for breakfast. Egg whites are topped with diced grilled squashes, slices of avocado, roasted red pepper aioli, and pecorino cheese to add a unique twist to the sandwich. It's served on the multigrain, which is my favorite. The bread is thin, but lightly toasted to give it the perfect chew, with seeds in the bread that give it a scrumptious texture and flavor.\n\nThe CHICKEN SALAD is my current favorite lunch sandwich. It's unlike your typical mayo-y, deli chicken salad - this refreshing chicken salad contains large pieces of chopped chicken with celery, sweet cranberries, and a whole grain mustard mayo that isn't applied too heavily. The lighter-take on everyone's favorite is served with tomato and greens on the multigrain bread!\n\nI enjoyed the GENOA sandwich, but it wasn't my favorite. The roasted chicken is pulled and lightly tossed in pesto, and topped with roasted red peppers, tomato, pecorino, and artichoke aioli.  I can't speak to the bread, as I had it on the multi-grain (of course :P). I wish there were more pesto or aioli, as it ate a little dry and would have benefitted from some more sauce. \n\nAnother delicious option is the HOUSE GRANOLA & YOGURT, which could be perfect any time of day. I'm not one to typically order this while out, since you can pretty much make it at home, but this was executed perfectly and I'd order it again. There it was a perfect ratio of ingredients, with a balance of granola and yogurt that was unmatched. Every bite had a perfect combination of both. The toppings added sweetness, crunchiness, and freshness, and I will certainly be ordering this again. \n\nI hope to try more of their sandwiches soon - I have my eye on the New Orleans and the Barcelona, but they seem a bit heavier so I've been waiting for the perfect day to order those. \n\nThere's a reason (well, many actually) that I come back here time and time again.

Perfect, and fun to soak up with the bun. Sandwich patty was clearly made in house, but smaller than the sandwich/bun, so you would definitely be eating egg, cheese, and bread alone for some of the bites. \n\nEgg white sandwich with roasted veggies, thin avocado slices, pepper aoli on whole grain bread. Kind of like an egg white omelette sandwich. Very hearty and filling. \n\nCaprese sandwich : best one! A little greens, tomato, generous amount of pesto, mozzarella, with a little drizzle of Balsamic.

I reached out to management a week ago and they have been completely nonresponsive and negligent.

I would like to protect future patrons from experiencing the same. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was at Plenty Cafe, a place I used to go to and study out of often. This is my story: \n\nIt's finals week. Last night, I was working out of a caf\u00e9 I go to often. A cafe known for being open late that many people use to study. It was late, and I was the only one in the space. At around 10, a group of three came into the space speaking loudly, above what one would consider normal. I turned to them and asked if they could keep it down a bit and they began to attack me.\n\nThe \"gentleman\", proceeded to yell at me. I responded by saying, it was just a question. I just asked a question. Then when he continued to harp on it, I insisted that I politely asked a question. Then he kept yelling \"shut the fuck up\". I defended myself and told him that he didn't need to say that to me and that I didn't need to \"shut up\". He then proceeded to call me a twat and insisted he was a gentleman for not breaking out the \"C\" word. Upon defending myself he told me that I had \"control issues\" and proceeded to yell at me and ask me if I was going to cry. I then told him that how he acts is on his conscious, and continued to work on my paper.\n\nI refused to let someone terrorize me into leaving the space. I stayed, worked on my paper. While I was working he kept making up stories about my life with his buddies. First insisting that my loud typing was me talking to my boyfriend and then taking it back saying I probably didn't have a boyfriend. Then later saying that I didn't have friends. While upset, I kept working. I wasn't going to let him intimidate me. So I just ignored him and kept going. Upon leaving he talked about what else he could do to provoke me but ultimately left me alone. He then proceeded to complain about what had happened with the staff. After the group had left, the wait staff said nothing. I stayed until close, thanked them, and still nothing.\n\nSince the election, I've felt afraid - as a woman and as a minority. I know there are bad people in this world, and while this upsets me, what upsets me more is that no one on the staff said anything. The older man was aggressively yelling \"shut the fuck up\" and \"twat\". At first I thought, well awkward situation to put yourself in the middle of but even after they left, no one asked me \"Are you ok?\" \"I'm sorry that happened\". They were silent. Silence is compliance.\n\nThese acts of hatred against women, against minorities, against LGBTQ, are happening all over the country. If you see something happening, please don't be quiet.

Definitely has a come in with friends and talk/hangout feel. Originally I liked Elixr coffee shop, but the longer I stayed there the less and less I'm liked it (background check - I'm also an introvert). There's just too much stimulation in one location. Also the coffee shop was packed! There was basically no seating. \n\nCoffee: Got a decaf pour over for pretty cheap! So I'm super happy about that. The coffee is pretty good. Strong and tempers well with cream. It doesn't hit you as hard as some other coffee's I had (very few though) but definitely still has good, well developed taste. The coffee was gentle enough to drink black - of course I still added cream because I like a thicker cup\n\nOther options: Didn't order anything else but it looks like they have a decently fresh looking variety of pastries in addition to teas. The cool thing about tea is that they give you a glass teapot for you to pour your own cup\n\nService: Service was super nice. I asked for a decaf - which not all smaller shops are prepared to serve - and they made me a pour over. I have a feeling if you asked for something the servers here would try their best to make it. Very laid back chill people, not very chatty - but that's fine of course. \n\nLayout & Location: The coffee shop is kind of hidden, it's on a small street between 15th and 16th. They did a very good job maximizing space and providing all sorts of work spaces. My favorite is the bar height table near the large window (overlooking... dumpsters and other passerby-ers). There's also a large main table, tables for two, and a couch area. There are ample plugs hidden everywhere - like under the couch.  Again, it's pretty loud here given that they're playing music super loud (Top 40) and there's a lot of people talking\n \nD\u00e9cor: Somewhat of a cross between a graffiti park and a laboratory... I like the dishware because the rim of the coffee isn't too thick (I know random right). The couch bench thing and the large collaborative main table is super unique and cool about this location.

I don't want to say I'm a coffee elitist, but I definitely pride myself on recognizing a decent cup of Joe. That's why I was so surprised that this place had flown under my radar for quite some time.\n\nMy friend and I decided to stop here after a de-lic-ious lunch at Good Dog Bar just across the street (check out my review!). When ordering coffee, I typically steer toward cafe au lait's, but I decided this time to go for the highly recommended pour over, using their Guatemalan roast. Now, while I understand that a pour over is as much a science as it is an art, I was disappointed when the barista preparing my drink completely botched her first attempt (how hard can it be to weigh coffee beans? Especially when you have a chart and scale in front of you...).\n\nI think this is the perfect opportunity to mention that while perusing other reviews, prior to my visit, I'd read that the baristas here can sometimes come off as a tad bit rude: preoccupying themselves in conversation, whether it be with each other or with friends in the shop. I'd hoped this wouldn't be the case during our visit -- there's nothing worse than that arrogant, pretentious attitude you sometime encounter at high-brow coffee shops -- sadly, I must now join the ranks of the disgruntled.\n\nMy friend, who'd ordered a cappuccino, stood patiently with me at the counter waiting for her order. While my barista was hard at work preparing her second attempt at my pour over, I noticed the other barista, deep in meaningless conversation with his buddy (who was standing directly next to us in line), was haphazardly preparing my friend's drink. Once done, and without skipping a beat, the barista put the drink on the counter (in front of his friend), continued his conversation, and made no acknowledgement that her drink was ready. Only because I'd been paying attention to what he was doing did I realize that the drink he'd made was indeed hers.\n\nI informed her that it was her drink, and sent her off in search of seats, which are limited, due largely to the fact that much of the space is occupied by communal tables. A concept which in theory is a great idea, but in practice means one or two people spreading their things across half the table.\n\nAnother 5 minutes and I was finally able to join my friend and enjoy my long awaited coffee. While the wait was a bit long, it was definitely worth it, seeing as my pour over was delicious. Just the right temperature, low acidity, with subtle notes of grapes and berries. My friend also really enjoyed her cappuccino, though when I tasted it, it was a little weak; both on taste and temperature.\n\nAll in all, Elixr's a decent place to grab a decent cup of coffee.

Elixr, Ultimo, Good Karma, etc... buy coffee elsewhere then bank on marketing to hide their mediocrity. Marketing should be a tool to say what you really do,  not what you do not do and tell the consumer you do, because it's all you care about. It's to make a lot of money. The people who really care about coffee take the time  to blend and roast them and brew a unique flavor.  In this country we use marketing to make people believe what is not true. Everybody follows like a herd of sheep. I really think the misuse of marketing really kill a lot talent, especially coffee shops. At least Starbucks even roasts their own coffee, despite their corporate model. It's very sad how people view coffee in this country. At least we have evolved from the 80's thanks to Starbucks, Stumptown, Blue bottle, Intelligentsia, La Colombe, and all the little independent coffee roasters.  It's not a science or art to brew coffee. It's an art to blend and roast coffee. Elixr and companies are avoiding the source of good coffee. They focus on brewing. To brew coffee you need a decent employee with some work ethics, that's all.", "date": "2011-08-28 15:19:06", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 1, "average_stars": 2.0, "yelping_since": "2011-08-28 15:17:30"}}

AND it's in my old hood so I didn't even have to walk past Broad street to get good coffee. Plus they have awesome slate tiling, marble countertops, vintage wood, and nice COMMUNAL (not picnic!) tables made by the Amish.\n\nElixr brews Kansas' PTs - lovely espresso blends, wonderful single-origin hand-pours, all with a great variety of flavor profiles. Like bright coffees with hints of citrus? Or chocolate-y, nutty, caramel-y? They definitely have em. They are more than happy to answer any questions, so don't be shy if you are new to the coffee world.\n\nBaristi are totally awesome/handsome/friendly. My favorites, just to name a few - Evan (the really really ridiculously good looking owner) + Blake (ask him to speak Arkansas) + Charley (he can make some mean spro!), etc. They take care in making your drinks and if you aren't happy with it (within good reason), they will not hesitate to remake it for you. \n\nPrices are extremely reasonable for an artisanal/specialty coffee shop. I'm sick of hearing people complain about the prices of coffee. We all need to be more educated on what goes on at coffee farms, the fact that they are DIRECT trade, and that everything is of the highest quality. Coffee is a commodity like oil/gas, prices rise, most specialty coffee shops do not change the price of their drinks despite increasing prices of coffee. So yes, I'd be more than happy to spend $3-$4 (don't forget to tip!) for some good stuff. \n\nAlso, they carry Au Fournil (O-foor-knee) pastries - closest thing I've had to real French pastries in Philly. My favorites are the almond, cream cheese danish, and pain au chocolat.\n\nElixr is a great place to relax, slow down, and get a mean cup of coffee.

As soon as you walk in it feels like you accidentally walked into an urban outfitters. I just get the slightly pretentious trying too hard vibe. Everyone there was wearing skinny jeans and beanies. The line was long, the menu's weren't accessible until you got all the way to the front. Then you have to make a split second decision on artisan coffee you've never heard of before. \n\nI cracked under pressure and asked the barista for what his favorite was and he recommended the Ethiopian but he couldn't tell me why (\"it's good if you like strong roasts\" or \"something different\" etc etc. maybe that's just me, but if I ask for a recommendation I'd like to know why YOU like it and maybe i'll like it for the same reason.) \nMy friend and I also ordered a cinnamon roll (very meh) and a scone. The barista accidentally dropped it on the floor and was apologetic but the downside is that there were no more. I don't blame the barista, accidents happen, the issue was that it seemed like there were only 3-5 pastries available for purchase. There are no extra's or back ups. She ended up getting a peach tart (also very meh)\n\nThe coffee. So you see it being all fancily dripped so you assume it's going to taste great- I am just not a fan. There was a weird sour-y aftertaste to the coffee and just not at all what I'm used to. Call me old fashioned but I just like a plain old dark roast without all the bells and whistles. It might look like an urban coffee shop but if you are looking for simplicity- this is not it.\n\nSeating was troublesome- not because it was too busy- but because the have long tables and some people take up the entire side of the table with their laptops and notes, coats etc. and there's no polite way to be like \"excuse me your crap is taking up a lot of space, I am literally sitting on my friend and you still won't move your stuff which means either you are inconsiderate or you are oblivious, either way I hate you.\"\nWhat's more is that I ended up waiting a good long while for my coffee, and when I got it, it was lukewarm. For about 7 dollars total, it was super not worth it.\n\nI think this might be a place for people who want to experience what it's like to be a hipster.

So probably like many other people, I saw their innovative sidewalk signs every time I passed (or went to) the neighboring Chipotle. (Side note: the one that really got me was \"Solange was framed!\") I love my coffee, but don't necessarily need it every day so nowadays I try to try out new coffee shops. What an experience! First, it's truly a hidden gem because it's located in the middle of a street no one has even heard of (Sydenham) and second, you feel like you're in a totally different city.\n\nAnyway, the main reason why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is due to their higher prices. The coffee is a standard size (12 oz. I think) so no need for that to be over $2 (was $2.25 to be exact) in my opinion. The cappuccinos and espresso shots go up from there, which is why I decided to start with just their regular brew of coffee. Woah, was it awesome! Even before I put any sweeteners in (love my sweets), I could tell that the coffee was a bit on the sweeter side. I've had better coffee than this (shout-out to Honduras and Nicaragua), but this was altogether an intriguing type of coffee.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was super chill and was very helpful in going through all of the choices with a newbie like me. Also, she verbally told me the prices for anything that wasn't on the menu. This was great for me personally as I hate when baristas/servers add on extra fees without informing you of them first. The ambiance (love saying that word) of this place is on point too. It gives a nice rustic, yet not-too-hippie feel.

I love, love to taut this places as the best espresso in the city, however, the treatment of patrons here is bordering ridiculous. There's always been a subtle attitude from the employees at this coffee bar, however, they took it to new heights last Saturday when I visited their new location before hitting a show at the Wilma. I walk in, the music is blaring, and I barely have time to think while waiting in line to order. A nice man making a pour over asked what I had wanted. I told him about three times, until he shook his head laughing that he could not understand me. (Clearly not either of our faults, the music was that loud). A second guy came up to make small talk with him instead and when the couple in front of me moved up, no one was manning the register. Finally chatty boy, when recognizing there were more people behind me, asked me what I would like, so I gave my order and asked for a croissant. I also had purchased Southpaw espresso to take home. With my hand outstretched, he slapped my change on the counter and walked away smirking without asking if I needed my coffee ground or really saying anything during the transaction. A third employee recognized that I was standing there in shock at the register, not sure what I had done, and had to walk away from what he was doing to come to the register instead, chatty boy ran to the back room. He came to the register and asked the next customer in line for their order. I asked if I could get my coffee ground, and he obliged, somewhat reluctantly. Chatty boy came out of his hiding place to snicker to the boy about me, making it a point to not make any eye contact with me the rest of my time in the store. Also want to point out that no bags exist here, apparently, except for brown paper lunch bags, which is all I got. I'd like to see what they would give me if I had bought a Chemex, but I'd probably get a dirty look for that, too. The only reason I wanted one was because I had to go to the theater and had nothing else on me to put it in, but the bag was like the exact same width, so there was no point. I waited for my drink, which still somehow took five minutes after everything else because the female barista was focused on talking with the customer behind me (clearly everyone's focus I guess, maybe I don't have the right look). I ran out of the store in utter disbelief at how rude everyone had been, and drank my macchiato and ate my croissant on the run to the show. It was just pathetic. I went to La Colombe later, also to buy coffee, and I am always able to get in and get out in minutes, and on top of that, have someone be polite and be proactive about a coffee purchase. Elixir should do the same, seeing as many of their coffees are sold in 12oz and are priced well over $20. Place just seems like a hangout for the employees to air whatever attitudes they want to air, I do not consider it to be a legitimate business, so maybe sales are not their concern, and therefore, neither are the customers. In the meantime then, if they care about financing their little barista cup trips they could do with exercising a lil bit of common courtesy. I don't give a sh*t how good the espresso is, I will never return if the employees put more effort into purposefully ignoring me or making me feel like I don't belong there then they care about producing and SELLING good coffee. It does the growers and the roaster a horrible disservice that these people are peddling their coffee.

I've been wanting to find my regular spot while I'm staying here in Philly for a few weeks. I work online and thrive working out in a coffee shop or cafe rather than sitting at home. I don't go somewhere every single day of the week, but about 3 days a week I need an awesome spot to post up at. \n\nThis coffee shop is off the main street down what feels like an alley. There's a cool #streetart mural on the wall just before you walk in. The vibe is modern, industrial and #hipster. I'll say the only thing I don't like about this place so far is the bathroom - it's right there when you walk in the front door and because of the way the door latches, there's a big gap/crack left where you feel like someone could peer in. \n\nIt's always been busy in here when I've come, with what looks like mostly students. They play good music and just the right volume... I wore my headphones the second day I've come here, but the first day actually enjoyed what they were playing. There's a seating area with a large, U-shaped couch and a communal coffee table and when you walk up the 4-5 stairs leading you to the counter, there's more tables and a long table with benches in the back. There's PLENTY of plugs which I really appreciate. It's super annoying when you go to a coffee shop and there are only 1-2 plugs in the most inconvenient locations... and then everyone's fighting over them. \n\nI really love the fact that the staff here is really polite and friendly. I mean, I haven't gotten into a conversation with anyone yet, but I really enjoy a good hipster coffee shop, but I really DON'T enjoy when the staff is uber pretentious and snobby. You don't get that here. You feel welcomed. \n\nSo far, I've had an incredible oat milk cappuccino (they don't carry almond milk so I'm assuming this is their only dairy-free milk option) that was so perfectly smooth (I think I'm obsessed!) and rich. I had a latte the second day, just to switch it up, and it was definitely good, but, cappuccino is the way to go here. It's not one of those overly foamy ones, but certainly not skimpy either. \n\nThey really know their coffee here, and although I'm more of an espresso girl myself, I will try the pour over when I'm there next time. They've got a good selection of not commonly found teas, and as a tea connosiour, I really appreciate that. They baked goods look delish and I also love that my cappuccino was only $3.50! For a dairy-free one with such, such good quality? Can't beat that. \n\nI wouldn't call this cozy, and it's certainly really busy, but it's not stale and professional either.

Tucked away on this side street is one of the better-known coffee roasters in town. If you're feeling bold (or if the caffeine addiction comes a-itching), follow the crowd to see what the buzz is about.\n\nImmediately, the blasting low-fi music and the distinct aroma of coffee give you a good sense of what Elixr is all about. Across from the entrance, a stainless steel barn door marks the no-purchase-required unisex stall, and to the left, you are led into a long space divided into two levels. Closer to the entrance are long cushioned benches surrounding a communal coffee table. The back half of the coffee bar is mezzanine-ed and houses a collection of table space. This coffeehouse channels chic industrial vibes, featuring an exposed HVAC, wooden flooring and furniture accents, tastefully-grungy exposed brick, and high bay windows. \n\nSeasonal single-origin brews and an assortment of offbeat espresso beverages (such as the autumnal Squash Kombucha latte) are all the rage here. Even midday on a weekday, Elixr may have a line weaving down from the mezzanine toward the entrance. Wifi is free and fast, and seating is usually available. The real tragedy, though, is that the table area, which is more conducive to work, has a dearth of outlets. Power stations are plentiful at the benched common area, but without a convenient place to spread your devices.

You will probably have to share a table (there are only two large wooden ones with benches on either side).

The El Salvador drip was very tasty. My gripes, though, are enough to bring my rating down to a 3... although most of the reviews up here are 4 stars, I think it is about a 3.5. Here are some reasons why: \n- internet is not entirely reliable, sort of shoddy and sometimes slow\n- not a lot of seating\n- outlets are scarce... 2 along the wall and one electrical strip beneath one of the long tables. \n\nOverall - lots of promise, looking forward to the latte!

Several times a day. \nBut when a NEW place opens in town, I, of course, being of sound (ish) mind and caffeine-craving body, must explore... experience...evaluate. Today, on a la-di-da afternoon when everone sauntered aimlessly about town, I set out on a mission to seek the new spot. I had read a few of the reviews, and prepared myself for some picnic tables and a varietal selection with a pour-over method, very similar to Spruce Street Espresso. Now, the term \"picnic tables\" is not really accurate...they are communal tables that happen to be beautifully hand-crafted from special wood by a guy from Amish Country. And it's really a nice way to feel connected to like-minded coffee lovers, in the way that places like Talulas Table, Le Pain Quotidien, or some other shops are catching on. \nService was not only friendly, but patient and willing - nay, ADEMANT, to please. The Baristas were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their product without being overbearing (many new places make this mistake and it makes for an uncomfortable experience, note the token phrase \"Have you been here before?\" Ugh.). I felt completely at ease as one Barista and I discussed my varietal options which were listed with accompanying flavor profiles. I personally prefer a dark roast coffee as thick as sludge and as espresso-like as you can get. The Barista said the darkest of what was available was probably the El Salvador, but that it honestly was not a dark roast. While waiting for my brew (this is not WAWA so don't expect a grab-n'-go situation...this is connoisseur country, mutha...) a woman came in and wanted brewed coffee...IMMEDIAMENTE. Today they didn't have coffee on tap. Usually they will have one varietal brewed in the urn, but today they only had enough beans to accomodate single cups. She was unwilling to wait, and pretty vocal about her frustration. I giggled to myself as the staff received her negativity with polite patience and sincerity. \n         I swirled and sniffed before I sipped, as I usually do with a new coffee, and alas! I didn't like it. It just wasn't for me. I was so sad, not because I didn't enjoy my expensive coffee, but more because - well, I liken it to someone giving you a wrapped Christmas gift, and you are so touched, and they are excited to have you open it and love the gift, and you hate it. You want to love it, but you don't...and they say \"I have the gift receipt...\" and you want to say \"no, no...it's great... thank you so much.\" but dishonesty only creates an elephant in the room of a friendship...and I wanted to be honest here, so I said as apologetically as I could \"I don't like it\". \n         The owner, a man so beautiful to look at I felt like I was tripping over my words the entire time, was determined to please me (if only more men understood this) and offered to brew me a cup of Ethiopian himself. While he was crafting my new drink (no he did not make me pay again), I learned he had spent time living in Indonesia, how proud he was of his new business (and yes, how excited he was about the communal tables. They really are beautiful.), and how passionate he is about coffee. I learned that the coffee they buy costs them more than I would ever expect, and that sustainability and quality are really priorities for him. He is humble and happy to be doing what he is doing, and his employees reflect his energy. It was intoxicating to stand among such proverbial warmth. \n       The Ethiopian was closer to my preferences, although not my favorite. But we talked in depth about flavor profiles and what I might like, things I know I DO like, and about the possibility of regular cupping events that he will host. I can't wait.\n         The food in the case looked amazing. I didn't recognize the pastries from anywhere I'd seen, but the almond crossaints looked like works of art, they were so beautiful. The sandwiches, I have read, are done by Marathon. I am over the moon about this place. Anyone who is as into coffee for coffee's sake as I am will be appreciative of a cafe of this caliber in the area. You don't come here for a 7-Eleven cup of blech. You come here for coffee that you enjoy because it's coffee. Good coffee. But what scores the extra point on the TD here is the staff. I got the feeling that I would be treated as well as I was today even if it weren't their opening week. \n......And, you know, being so beautiful that you make Gale turn into a blithering puddle of jimmer jammer (no - I have no idea what that even MEANS) doesn't hurt, either.

I live in Center City and have for years. I'm a half-block away from this location and pop in 7-10 times a week. If you remember the place that was here before, The Coffee Bar, then you would know that this place is an upgrade. \n\nFirst, let's talk about how it is one of the very few places you can get quality Matcha tea in the area. For a big city like Philly, this is kinda sad. Also, the menu isn't built for people who want to sit down and eat 3 plates of bacon. Little Pete's, which is also amazing, is across the street for that. This menu has quinoa, avocado toast, eggs, granola, etc. They have a ton of gluten-free options as well. The coffee menu has flat whites, black and whites, long blacks, piccolos, etc. It is just very different than what is in Philly right now. And I think that is a good thing.\n\nThe ambiance is much better than before, too. The place is bright white and well-lit. When it first opened of course there were kinks to be worked out. That is everywhere. Federal Donuts, Double Knot, and other spots I've been to have all had hiccups when they started. For me, it was them running out of things I wanted to order. Since then it hasn't happened, and I'm guessing because they nailed down their sales. \n\nLastly, I have seen some complaining about price. And that's what compelled me to write this review. I assume that if you can leave a Yelp review, then you can look up prices online. Or better yet, on the menu when you're in the store. If you don't want to pay for organic avocado on gluten-free toast with an organic egg then don't do it. Again, you're paying for organic and gluten-free. It's not cheap anywhere. \n\nI think it's fitting that Bluestone Lane is situated between Parc and Little Pete's. Not cheap delicious diner food and not overly expensive French cuisine. Something in the middle.

All of these ingredients went very well together, so that you could take a bite of any two or three of them and it was a solid mix of flavors.  (It's a deconstructed bowl, so it's up to the diner to either mix it all together or to assemble individual bites throughout the meal.)  \n\nI will say that without the feta, there was no salt/seasoning in the dish, so each bite did need that component in order to taste complete.  The poached egg was also overcooked, but I'm not as deeply in love with runny eggs as everyone else seems to be, so it was alright with me.\n\nLastly, the staff and owner stay on top of quality improvement and I really do appreciate that.

After my previous review in regards to the piccolo coffee, I decided to give the food a try. I asked for vegemite + avocado smash. I asked for extra cherry tomatoes on top. The nice guys over the counter told me it came with cherry tomatoes. Did not say anywhere in the menu (under the toast section). And I pointed to what I wanted on the menu, not sure how that could be misleading. They asked if I wanted feta, I said no. They asked if I wanted tahini, because it comes with it. I thought tahini, feta, avocado together? That goes my macro allowance! (Just joking). I was worried and overwhelmed that my humble vegemite and avocado has turned out to be this gigantic monster spread. I gave it a go. I didn't complain, I'm no chef, I'm sure they know what they are doing. I got back to the hotel and I was gobsmacked! I had a piece of toast that was half vegemite on one side of the bread and tahini on the other, topped with very unriped avocado. For vegemite eaters, we know that we don't smack a lump of vegemite on bread, it is served sparingly with some sort of fat; butter more commonly or avocado. I was frustrated that I got a blob of Vegemite on one side and tahini on the other, ( you (can see the division on that piece of toast), it became inedible (I'm sorry if that sounds rude). \n\nThe thing is that I came to Bluestone to have my regular brunch fix to feel at home. Although I was happy to go somewhere else to have brunch, but when a cafe claimed to serve Vegemite and piccolo I expect them to do it correctly, I don't think that's a lot to ask.

Our servers were friendly and happy to answer questions. Yes, it's no cash, which they tell you in advance.

With everything we already have in Philly, you'd think it would be difficult to open up a unique cafe here where you can order things you can't get anywhere else...but that's exactly what this place has done. Bluestone Lane is extremely popular in NYC and has perfected the super trendy, \"did you really eat it if you didn't Instagram it\" avocado toast. \n\nYou may think, \"Really...$12 for a piece of toast with avocado on it? Gimme a break.\" But it is so much more than just that. The toast is multigrain and really tasty and then slathered with the most delicious tahini (which is a sesame seed paste). Then, it is piled high with \"avocado smash\" which is Bluestone Lane's special avocado mixture. YUM it is SO GOOD. It also has sunflower sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, and feta cheese. All very fresh and complements the avocado very nicely. You can also add a poached egg for $2 if you wish. \n\nThe ambiance of this little cafe is so cute and it's kind of separated from the front where you can walk in and order coffee and the back of the cafe where you can sit and order with table service. Also, bonus points because it's nicely decorated with teal and white pillows on the seats for your back.\n\nI ordered the avocado smash (obviously) and a flat white. The flat white was exactly what I expected. It was piping hot with a nice design and had a kind of sweet, acidic taste which I liked. From the time I sat down to the time I got my food it was probably about 6 minutes. They only had one waiter and I sat in the corner so I just got his attention and my food came in no time at all. It didn't seem like anyone around me waited more than 10 minutes for their orders. I know a lot of other reviews on here commented about the wait but keep in mind, this cafe is brand-new and it seems like they've fixed the wait time problem already. Pretty great, if you'd ask me. \n\nAll in all, I gave 5/5 stars for the cute ambiance, amazing avocado toast, yummy coffee, great customer service, and that there was hardly any wait time at all.

It's at a great location on an intersection of South 17th and Locust Streets with the street entrance on 17th. It is bright, well lit, clean and neat with a nice modern interior.  It was not too crowded or noisy when I was there on a Saturday morning for breakfast -- which was 9-10 a.m. The breakfast food is creative and very good. At least it is my idea of a good breakfast that is not merely the standard eggs and bacon or pancakes and waffles. The wait staff are courteous and professional. \n\nIt is a restaurant, not just a caf\u00e9, so is not yet another Center City caf\u00e9 where you order coffee, pastries or a breakfast wrap from a limited menu at the counter and then find a bar stool or a catch-as-catch-can seat at a table. Though it has bar seating along a wall, it primarily seats customers at a number of individual two- and four-person tables where you are waited upon -- exactly what I was looking for to meet a friend for Saturday morning breakfast. \n\nMy only minor criticisms are that the boutique juices are pretty pricey (at around $10 for a glass), so I personally gave those a pass, and the decanters they serve the hot coffee in are literally too hot to touch. They look like little glass milk jars. My dining companion and I actually had to use our napkins to pour our coffees, so they need to find other coffee decanters to serve coffee. (Hint to the management: The waitstaff should offer to decant the first serving of coffee when it's brought to the table, in any case -- at least I think that would be more in line with the setting and level of service you are trying to offer.) However, I certainly won't detract any stars for these minor issues.\n\nThough the juices are pricey, the meals are very reasonable. My dining companion and I had breakfast and coffee for under $20 each, including tax and a 20% tip, which is a great value for a Center City breakfast spot that is this nice. \n\nThis restaurant connects directly to the Warwick Hotel building which provides an interior entrance to the restaurant, so exiting the restaurant down that hallway leads to the restrooms, which are equally tasteful and very clean, always a telling attribute of any establishment. \n\nI hope the management and staff keep up the good work because, at least as of the date of this review, if you're wanting a nice place for breakfast or brunch I definitely recommend Bluestone Lane. It's definitely a great contribution to the Center City morning eateries.", "date": "2018-12-01 17:08:01", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 25, "average_stars": 3.41, "yelping_since": "2010-06-18 21:50:34"}}

Once there, I realized that I wanted to try out something from their menu as well. I got the Aussie Baked Bean that came on a hot skillet. It looked very cute but it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked. For me it was flavorless ( no seasoning whatsoever!!). So it came with 2 organic poached eggs, baked beans, arugula and two slices of bread on the side. I have to say that bread was the only thing that tasted good. As a drink I got a matcha latte. This one was very yummy. They used almond milk for it. \n\nService - pretty much horrible. My boyfriend ordered a small coffee that apparently they forgot to bring it. I was already done with my latte when we asked the waitress what happened to the coffee order and apparently they had forgot. We went to order at the counter and no server came up to us at all throughout the whole time we sat. Another thing that I didn't like was the whole kitchen idea being in the middle of the cafe.

I did not remember being so disappointed after my first visit to this location a year ago. \n\nFood - do not be fooled by the pictures. The plating sure looks nice, but the portion is unbelievably tiny. Almost every single dish on the menu that is savory contains sheep milk's feta. As I don't eat sheep/goat dairy products, I requested to substitute the cheese to any thing else, but I was told that they do not have any other cheese and could only remove the cheese completely from the dish. I decided to ordered the green baked eggs without feta in the end. It was such a bad choice - without any cheese, the dish did not even have any flavor. There was two eggs that were cooked through, and some unseasoned spinach at the bottom. No flavor at all. \n\nCoffee - you would think the coffee here will taste good since it's a coffee shop after all. Latte for $3.5 is tiny. The coffee is mediocre and tastes bland. They do not offer free refill for regular coffee even if you're eating in. \n \nEnvironment - the place is actually a good study spot, although I did not find any outlets but it has WiFi. It's also very quiet, and almost empty on a Sunday afternoon. \n\nService - I might be already biased when the server told me that they could not substitute feta, but I was further surprised about the poor service during my meal. Right after my food is served and I started eating, the server came by to sweep the floor right next to me three times. I did not get a picture when she was right next to me, but the two pictures shows when she was sweeping nearby. On her fourth visit to my table, she asked me how my food was while holding the broomstick in her hand. \n\nAfter I finished the food, I left for another coffee shop to continue my work.

Located inside the Warwick Rittenhouse Hotel, the cafe is spacious with indoor and outdoor seating available. I love the clean, minimalist aesthetic of the cafe. Every table has a QR code that pulls up their menu and ordering site so you can order and pay directly on your phone. The menu is health focused with a lot of nutritiously balanced dishes full of greens, proteins, and carbs. Although their food menu is not large, everything looks really good and in reality the food also taste good. Definitely one of the few foods healthy foods that I've had that also taste good Their drinks menu on the other hand is quite extensive and similarly, they all look good too. Price wise, everything was very reasonable. \n\n*BREAKFAST*\nBeet latte - the name says it all. It  was my first time trying a beet drink of any sorts and you can definitely taste the beets in this. It taste pretty good.\n\nGreen baked eggs - Shakshuka-style baked eggs dished. Although it came out in a relatively small cast iron, this dish was filling. The chimichurri made the dish quite flavorful, not bland at all. I love the runny over easy style eggs. Solid mix of greens, proteins and carbs. \n\n*VERDICT*\nI would definitely come back again.

It had variety of breakfast  selections that other places at times do not offer.  \n\nWe ordered some food dishes and 1 hot chocolate, 1 coffee and 1 cortado, and we were served with avocado bowl first.  Then only 1 coffee arrived.  We sat for 15 minutes more as I did not get my coffee.  When I brought this up to my waiter, he became agitated and told us that there was problem in the kitchen, but what did it have to do with cortado? Not sure.  He wanted to comp for the inconvenience of cortado brought in  so late and stormed off when he was suggested that drinks should arrive together and before the food.  He them never came back to  check up on us.  All poached eggs were raw and undercooked, and my husband asked to replace it, but another waitress promised to replace it, but never did.  \n\nAs I walked to see if they had any baked goods, the same waitress started to show me directions to the bathroom, which I never asked.

This same waitress was also asked to bring butter, but she just ignored it or was just spaced out.  \n\nA side note, our waiter was also arguing with another customer and they were both agitated.  \n\nThe drip coffee was good, but the cortado had too much milk. \n\nThe staff seemed apathetic, dismissive, rude and overwhelmed.  When we asked the spaced out waitress if she was overwhelmed, she responded that she wasn't, yet she never brought our butter, our eggs, never acknowledged our feedback, did apologize, and we were never comped the coffee ad promised.\n\nSome suggestions to the owners:\nPlease train your staff on customer service and have more supervision on site.

For example, there were 2 pieces of feta cheese in the whole dish - not enough to actually give it any flavor profile, but still there.

The service model is horrendous. On the many times I have stopped in on my morning commute (between 7:30am-8:30am), the order of operations behind the coffee bar has been clunky and slow for those of us ordering coffee to-go. I deliberately choose cold brew, regular coffee, or a juice (vs. espresso drinks which take longer) when I'm in a hurry. The person who takes orders also fulfills simple coffee orders AND serves the sit-down area in the back. This means that when there are 1 or more people waiting at the cashier, they are waiting for more than 5 minutes to even put their coffee order in and pay. Then they wait another 10 minutes for their cold brew to appear on the other side of the counter! In addition, the cashier doesn't even acknowledge the people waiting in line with a \"I'll be right with you.\" The pace of the staff is almost slow motion.

After about 20 mins, the server seemed apologetic and offered us an appetizer as we waited, we accepted (stay tuned for more on that later). The app was toasted bread with a refried type black bean paste and cheese melted on top, it was good, not great but the kids liked it. About 5 mins after that came the tamale dish of one adult at the table, no one else's food was in sight. She liked her dish. Next came nachos: as another Yelper stated, it was good but with too many cold components to make it great. It seemed each dish came out within 10 mins of the one before... My husbands migas especial came and he, who has NEVER in all the years I've known him, not eaten what he's ordered, did just that today... He just did not like the soupiness not the flavor of the dish...total surprise to me.

Always while heading in the opposite direction.  Well today I discovered what I've been missing, great Mexican food west of the Italian Market area.  \n\nAfter a late night of perhaps a little too much to drink, I stumbled out of the house in search of something good to eat and decided now was as good a time as any to explore the culinary offerings of my new neighborhood. Well I got about half a block before coming to cafe con chocolate.  I approached to find that this was more than just a coffee shop but a Mexican/Japanese fusion restaurant.  I had to check it out.\n\nOnce inside I discovered that the menu was mostly Mexican.  There weren't many Japanese offerings but other options abounded.  Upon the recommendation of another customer, I ordered the enchiladas with pork and a side order of the home fries, which were touted on the board outside the restaurant.  The enchiladas came covered in a delicious salsa verde with a side of rice and refried beans.  Everything was wonderful.  The pork was tender and well flavored and was complemented perfectly by the salsa.  The potatoes came out piping hot but once cool I found them to be well flavored and with a great texture.  They were nice and crisp on the outside and tender but firm on the inside.  They also were great when dipped in the salsa.  I wish I had more room in my stomach.  \n\nThe staff was friendly as well as the clientele.  The decor was warm and there was great art on sale.  My only complaint is that this place is not open more.  They are not open Mon-Wed and don't open until 10 am the other days.  I could see myself getting breakfast here most mornings. In any case I will return often.

Methinks not\" sums up our experience quite well.\n\nI can and can not believe all of the raving reviews for this restaurant, alas, we had a horrid experience! \n \nWe had tickets to see Rain at 1:00 and decided to check out Cafe con Chocolate for brunch, which is basically Mexican cuisine, although they do have a small selection of Japanese, imagine fusion of a Mexican and Japanese menu...\n \nThe place is tiny, with probably ten to twelve small tables all pushed together and they were all either seated or dirty when we walked in, so we chose to seat ourselves at the counter, which had six stools. The restaurant is colorful with bright walls, decorated with paintings that are for sale and shelves holding both Mexican and Japanese pieces. The floors are old and unfinished wood, which even have knot holes allowing the light from the basement to shine through. \n \nThey do their own baking, as I witnessed the cook putting up trays of cookies and baked goods, while also preparing folks meals.\n \nThe dirty dishes get scraped and piled up into the hand washing sink behind the counter or stacked on the counter still loaded with uneaten food. The kitchen is off to the right with a queer set up, there is a board that the food is set on to be delivered to the tables, yet when the server walks into the kitchen, she must duck under this board and then immediately go down one step.\n \nI will give our server five bright and shiny stars, how she did it, I will never know. First of all they offer a huge variety of coffee drinks, chocolate drinks, including mochas, smoothies, fruit drinks. She had a memory like none I have ever witnessed and as tables came in, she would take their order, take it to the kitchen and then make drinks, which took her quite some time and if another table came in, she would then take their order and go back to making drinks for that first table. Expect your beverages to take 15 to 30 minutes!\n \nWe walked in at 11:30, ordered at 11:45, we got our food at 12:45, well not quite, as it sat on the board for a good five minutes until we finally stopped her and said our food has been sitting there, we're hungry, we have a 1:00 play and it is getting cold. One server, who kept apologizing, she was doing her very best, including take out orders for drinks and food. Until that point, we kept saying it was okay, no worries, but at that point we had enough.\n \nI ordered the molletes, which I had never had before and they sounded interesting. Two long buttered rolls with a layer of black beans, cheese and a bowl of very good Pico de gallo was served on the side. I had added chorizo and over easy eggs to top the molletes. I made it a point to tell her that I liked my whites cooked but my yolks completely runny. \n \nWell my eggs came out over hard, no runny yolk whatsoever. I showed her that the yolks were hard and she was planning on taking the plate back and I said no, we have to leave, just bring me two more eggs cooked properly. I wasn't the only table who sent back food, even though I held onto mine like it was gold. The eggs came right out, I ate half of one molletes, the eggs and packaged the rest to go.\n\nTo make matters worse there was no chorizo on the molletes, but at this point I didn't even care! We were still charged for it, getting your check takes another 5-10 minutes, as she then adds up everything that you ordered. Rather than argue we paid for the sausage, since our play, which was across town, had already started. \n \nMichael ordered the enchiladas, of which you had your choice of fillings, he ordered ground beef, etc., and your choice of mole sauce or a green salsa Verde, he chose the mole and got the salsa. It was also to come with a side of beans and rice. Now if you want to take a look at the other posters pictures, we had envisioned Spanish rice and refried pinto beans, the black beans were great, but the rice? It was plain white rice, totally unseasoned, I mean totally and had corn stirred in? Which looked nothing like this picture http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qaDImxPguQz0jToNYvB1Eg?select=59lHgE8PVzkzrLrV3iGtvQ\n \nPortions are all huge and I enjoyed watching all of the food that came out of the kitchen. I watched as the owner/manager? Walked in right before we left and start to clean up the tables and dishes. One cook, one server on a very busy Sunday morning, maybe he should hire more help or come in quite a bit earlier. \n \nIt's not located in the best section of the city, debris and litter everywhere and many folks who looked like they could be trouble. If you plan on checking out Cafe con Chocolate, I would suggest visiting on a week day or if going on the weekend plan on wasting a couple to a few hours.", "date": "2012-02-09 11:33:31", "useful": 12, "funny": 9, "cool": 7, "user": {"review_count": 793, "average_stars": 3.58, "yelping_since": "2008-04-22 21:44:02"}}

The lady working at the counter is this super-sweet girl who provided excellent service. Don't get me started on the traditional Mexican coffees/drinks and desserts!!!\n\nI got the Iced Blue Amaze and my friend got the Iced Cafe Con Chocolate, and both were delish! The blue amaze is a shot of espresso blended with ice, honey, cream, and this corn maize substance. I know - it sound strange, but the heartiness of the corn added an extra dimension to balance out the cream and espresso. The Cafe Con Chocolate had a rich chocolate base that brought out some of the coffee-espresso flavors, wrapped in some cinnamon. These drinks were so unique and ethnic (plus iced on a hot day) - perfect!!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the desserts - These are the BEST CHURROS I ever tasted, and really delicious Tres Leches cake. The churros were perfecttttt!!! They came out hot and piping with a careful blanket of sugar over. The churros is crispy on the outside and creates a gradient of crispy to soft/gooey in the center. Omgggg, sooo good! The center is so soft and delectably doughy, it melts in your mouth. Amazing!! I have to try the caramel ones next time. The chocolate sauce on the side was very light and liquid, not very rich. This actually worked perfectly because it let the churros truly shine, lightly flavored with cinnamon-chocolate.\n\nThe Tres Leches was also tres delicious!!! The cake was airy, light and fluffy, soaking up the condensed milk and cream at the bottom. It reminds me of how lady fingers soak up coffee in a well-crafted tiramisu. The beauty was the cake truly was light and took in the three creams, creating an almost cheesecake-like texture. The magic was that the cake was not soggy, but rather fluffed up from the cream. Yum!!! \n\nI'd love to come back here for brunch or more desserts!

Went for dinner without expectations, despite the amazing reviews here. It's in a totally middle-of-nowhere location, but it's right of 76. It's a tiny place, very unassuming. With a completely wacky menu. I guess it's Mexican, but nothing that's commonly served in an Americanized Mexican. And there are Japanese entrees too. And the most amazing hot chocolate ever. But I'll come back to that...\nWe went at 7 on a Saturday night and there was only one other couple there. There are small round tables for two, a homespun sort of feel in the \"decor\" with just-right lighting. A young woman behind the counter was super-nice and genuinely glad to see us. \nWe ordered tacos with potatoes and nopales (cactus) - i know it sounds crazy - and a pork torta (hot sandwich). They came in plastic baskets. And the tacos were AMAZING! incredibly flavorful, just the right amount of heat. I could eat them every day and be happy. The torta was excellent too, but less interesting. It was large and loaded with pork, but not in that deli too-much-meat-in-a-sandwich way. The bread was deliciously crusty. \nThe staff was absolutely charming. The cook came out and asked how the food was, not to be impressive like you get at upscale restaurants, but because she really wanted to know. She asked if it was the first time i'd had nopales (it was) and was obviously pleased at how much i liked them. It felt as though we were at a friend's house for dinner the first time and they really wanted us to like it.\nWe finished off with a cafe on chocolate - really hot chocolate. It was huge and absolutely delicious. As good as any I've had at the fancy chocolate shops. \nAll of that for $21 and a very big tip.\nI hesitate to share this find - but these people deserve to be outrageously  successful. So go!

Given the location, I was hardly surprised. So I grabbed a seat at the rear, and took a look at the menu. Tap water sans ice was immediately brought over, but there was no coffee order taken. Considering there were two employees working front of house and (including my table and the previously mentioned) a total of four customers, I was hoping to receive some coffee quickly. This is one of the first things ALL breakfast/brunch places should consider top priority. When people are awake on the weekend, they like to be caffeinated. I understand this is not universal, but for the brunch crowd it is pretty standard. So the waitress proceeds to not come over for about ten more minutes, while I scour the menu. All the while, listening to a strange smooth jazz play list of contemporary covers, and watching a computer monitor slideshow of said waitress on a trip somewhere. Two more people showed up, and I was worried all was lost. Would coffee even be an option now that there were six customers?\n\n\nWell the coffee did come, however the order was taken with the food order. One Cafe con Chocolate (coffee with chocolate) and one black coffee, which took the same amount of time to get to us as the food. A huge issue for me. On a rainy day (or any day) when I am at brunch, I want to be sipping my beverage while waiting for my food. I would understand if they were backed up at the barista counter, but they were not. It was a huge disappointment. \n\nSo the food came, along with the coffee, which was now too hot to drink until after I finished my torta. Oh yea, I ordered the chorizo and egg torta. It came on a crusty loaf of bread, and was HUGE. The ingredients were all tasty and included, sour cream and beans on one side of the bread, with chipotle mustard dip on the other. Packed in between was queso fresco, mozzarella cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion, and avocado, along with the aforementioned chorizo and eggs. The eggs were moist and not over cooked, and the flavors were all there. I wish the chorizo had more bite/spice, as it was quite mild. Overall, this was a pretty great breakfast torta. It was hardly authentic, but it was good, and at $8, a generous portion. \n\nMy dining mate decided to be a bit more ambitious, and tried the huevos ahogados. It consisted of two eggs poached in salsa verde, with a side of refried beans, and chorizo was added to the order. On paper it sounded like it had potential (although I was skeptical), however in reality, it turned out to be a big flop. The dish lacked any kind of contrast of textures. It was basically a big bowl of warm salsa, with two poached eggs, some mashed beans, and chorizo. Everything in it was soft or chewy. It would have been a completely different story if there were some tortillas, or more reasonably, some chips served on the side. Or, perhaps even a spoon! Alas, there were none of the above, and the waitress then disappeared for about fifteen more minutes, and there was no longer any point. The flavor  was there in this dish, but the execution  was completely off point. There was no way to eat it, and the fork was very little help. It was a bowl of mush.\n\nI like the idea of Snyder Ave. getting some love and offering something interesting besides the sadness that occupies most of the avenue west of Broad, but unfortunately, Cafe con Chocolate needs some work.

I ordered the oaxacan hot chocolate, and it was below expectations. Chocolate flavor was weak, and the drink itself tasted too watered down for my liking. \n\nFood: I ordered sopa de tortilla and chorizo flautas. The soup was good, I was sick that day, but it was a nice bring me up kind of dish. Flavors were good, there was a nice savory, but sour/citrusy kick to the broth which I enjoyed. Definitely one of the better sopa de torillas I have had. For the chorizo flautas, it was mediocre in my opinion. I've had similar quality flautas in more americanized restaurants. I thought the chorizo itself was good, not dry, but didnt have an explosive chorizo flavor (spicy kick) I am used to. Flautas were crisp but bland. Rice and refried beans I had were room temperature and tasted like every other rice and beans I've had\n\nDessert: Ordered the churros with chocolate dip. This dish itself is the reason I am giving the restaurant a 3 star and not a 2 star. Churros were very good. They had a crisp outside, soft and warm inside. Cinnamon and sugar was on point and not overly sweet at any point. The dipping sauce/cafe was delicious. I think they used one of their drinks on the menu as the dip (chocolate espresso maybe?).

Was all the way back to our hotel when we found out so it was too late to do anything about it. The huarache was disappointing. It was more like a large taco. The huarache did not have any thickness to it. The beef seasoning and flavored was just off and I was off out by the peas and carrots cooked in the meat. The steak nachos were more like nachos with steak fajitas on top of them which consisted of a ton of bell peppers. Had we wanted fajitas we would have ordered them. The churros were good but considering we got the cajeta ones we would have expected more cajeta to be included. They did include a tiny cup of hot chocolate for dipping which I thought to be creative and cute. Overall this meal was average and all the flavors are just a bit off to make you not want to order that item again. Not likely I'd recommend but might return for a hot chocolate on a cold day.", "date": "2020-09-22 04:38:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 101, "average_stars": 4.3, "yelping_since": "2011-01-28 21:03:49"}}

While moderately deep in South Philly, the corner shop is only a block from the Broad and Snyder station. The restaurant stretches deep back into the narrow space. As you enter and walk up a couple of steps and past the coffee shop prep area. The warm-toned walls are decorated sparingly with artwork, including a series of ink portraits and a square charcoal still-frame. The fireplace and exposed-brick mantle are repurposed into a bookshelf complete with trinkets and merch. Pull-apart faux-wood tables are paired with standard black-framed chairs and wooden benches. Spanish classics play pleasantly in the background.\n\nWe began our late lunch with an Iced Mexican Mocha and Horchata. The mocha ran strong, packing two shots of espresso and balanced out with the spiced Oaxacan chocolate. The horchata maintained a strong cinnamon flavor with a subdued sweetness. For eats, with opted for a Chorizo Burrito and Molletes (open-faced Portuguese rolls topped with beans and cheese) with Carnitas. The burrito appeared unassuming upon its large serving plate, but the flour tortilla was generously filled, mostly with the meat and melty mozzarella (the lettuce and tomatoes were served atop the burrito instead of within). The chorizo was flavorful without being overwhelmingly greasy. Meanwhile, the molletes were served in a picturesque flower pattern, with a large mound of flavorful carnitas in the middle. The Portuguese roll was buttery and pillowy, while the rich queso Chihuahua was perfectly melty without becoming a liquid mess. Both entrees were well-complemented by three sauces (green, red, hot), all delicious. My favorite was the sweet, savory, and spicy red sauce.\n\nI felt right at home with the pleasant and attentive service. At $45 for brunch and beverages, Cafe y Chocolate seems a bit of a premium for Mexican fare, but a major steal among the Philly brunch scene.", "date": "2021-06-27 21:05:37", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 211, "average_stars": 4.08, "yelping_since": "2016-12-30 22:23:33"}}

This review is based on four visits.  After my initial visit I was shouting about CCC from the rooftops, urging everyone I knew to go there, but now my opinion has changed and it's all based on the service the last 2 times I went there.\n\n\nFood: Every time I have been there it has been amazing.  I love the Mexican brunch so so much, I'm not sure which adjectives I can use to express it best.  I dream about this Mexican brunch regularly.  I love everything about it.  Six stars. (Yes, I know Yelp only goes up to five, but I choose six.)\n\nDrinks: I love the drink selection.  Everything is delicious.  The regular coffee, the iced coffee, the fruit shakes, and especially the signature drink, the Cafe Con Chocolate.  Try this, you haven't had mocha until you've tasted this one.  Six stars.\n\nSpace: I like the fact that it's in kind of a weird neighborhood that I otherwise would never go to.  It takes a lot for me to leave Northern Liberties.  If this place was in a trendy neighborhood, most likely I'd never go, because I wouldn't want to wait an hour to get a table.  The inside is cute and kind of reminds you of being in someone's house.  I like the fact that it's small with small tables. \n\nService: Ok, here it is.  THIS is the reason I have to give CCC a total rating of 2 stars.  The service on my last TWO visits was ZERO out of 5 stars.  On my first bad visit, we walked in and the restaurant was about half full.  There was a young Mexican waitress working.  No exaggeration - it took us FORTY FIVE MINUTES to even get our drinks.  I am not joking.  To add insult to injury, I ordered the cafe con chocolate and she served me cappuccino.  It took me an additional 5-10 minutes to get the drink I ordered.  The food came out about 10-15 minutes later.  I was RAVENOUS by the time my food came.  There was no excuse for these ridiculous delays as far as I could see.   \n\nI decided to give CCC the benefit of the doubt (anyone can have a bad day, right?) and went again a few weeks ago.  The time, if it's possible, the service was EVEN WORSE, which baffled me.  We walked in and were seated and there was only one other table of 2 people present.  It remained this empty for our entire stay.  Our drink and food orders were taken promptly by a middle aged, short, female server.  She was friendly and our drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time.  Then we waited, and waited, and......WAITED.  About 45 minutes after we got our drinks, the waitress came over and said \"ummm....you guys ordered already, right?\"   YES we ordered, 45 minutes ago.  She reconfirmed our order and walked over to the kitchen.  This lady OBVIOUSLY forgot to put in our order and left us sitting there 45 minutes after she originally took it and an hour after we walked in.  It then took an additional 20 minutes for our food to come out.  She FINALLY brought it out and at this point were were STARVING.  She made some lame unbelievable excuse that the kitchen had to \"make fresh beans\" for my dish.  This was not believable in any way.  Also totally unacceptable.  \n\nI hate to write this because I love CCC so much, besides the service.  I'd love for them to get it together service-wise so I can return to many more delicious brunches.

I had almost forgotten to bring cash but I'm glad I did as they are cash-only.\n\nIn general: The menu on Sunday was different than previous. It was condensed and there was nothing Japanese on there anymore that I saw. There are a couple of new, larger tables to compliment the smaller ones. The messy computer station that took up eating space is gone. The wooden doorway food serving board is gone. The paint is fresh. The food came out quite a bit faster than in the past. It's slow but please, remember that this is a cultural place and they encourage you to come & sit, relax, talk, and hang out. When you go here, expect to wait for your food. Don't expect them to bring your check when you are finished eating. They want you enjoy the time with your companions,  to feel at home there, and will bring the check once you ask for it. Not all cultures kick you out to clear tables for more guests. \n\nThe food: I always find myself gravitating towards the enchiladas with mole sauce because well, let's face it, they are delicious. The chocolate flavor really shines through the mole and yet maintains a nice spicy kick that delights. The cheese inside is firm and of good quality. It's not some greasy blob they try to hide. The beans are of the black variety and have full flavor. I wasn't as thrilled with my rice this time but I was full from the main part of the dish so I just moved it aside.\n\nOver all, this place is worth a visit.

I've been reading some bomb reviews and was really curious about the hype. \n\nWe walked in at about 12:30pm and got the last available table. Our waitress was sweet but a bit pushy. She asking us if we were ready to place our order every few minutes and this happened three times. She was really nice about it though so I took it as a sign that she was just excited to serve us. \n\nAfter asking a couple questions, we were ready to order. I got the scrambled tofu, my friend had the chicken tinga empanadas, and we got an order of churros to share. We had the option of ordering plain churros or ones with caramel filling and decided to go all in and get the ones with caramel. \n\nThe scrambled tofu that I got was great. There was nothing special about it, but it was made well and was very filling. I was given a side of tortillas to create my own soft shell tacos which I enjoyed. My friend seemed to really like her entree and commented about how great the chicken tinga was. \n\nThe churros are what stood out the most though. They were absolutely amazing. They were warm, coated with cinnamon sugar, and had the most delicious caramel filling. They came with a homemade chocolate dipping sauce which I honestly didn't care much for. I was totally fine with the churros without the chocolate. They also came with fresh slices of strawberries and whipped cream on the side - I really liked that! No matter what you do, GET THE CHURROS. At only $4 for an order of six, you really can't go wrong. \n\nMy only complaint is that all of their entrees are savory, there are no sweet options. Of course there's the churros, but that isn't an entree. I would have loved to see some pancakes or waffles on the menu with some kind of Mexican twist. \n\nStill, Caf\u00e9 y Chocolate is a good option for brunch. I definitely want to try one of their hot beverages like a coffee or hot chocolate next time I visit.

To be perfectly honest, if it werent for the awesome reviews, we would have lived LITERALLY down the road and never came here (signage needs some word, you need to stand out a bit more!).  We went into it knowing we wanted to binge.  We ordered (to take out because we work from home) the meatball parm sandwich with steak fries and the chicken cutlet sandwich with steak fries.  I asked on the phone about how much it would be and also how long it would take.  He informed me that with the steak fries (a little extra) it would be about $20 (not too bad I guess but I hope theyre big decent sandwiches because for 10$ a plate, I hope it's large).  He told me to give him 10 minutes- that's where I nearly fell in love!  I so appreciate them getting it out so quickly!  This place is cash only but they do have an ATM so thats good.  When I went to pick up the food I was delighted at how quick the process was, in and out and the parking was awesome too.  The food turned out to be excellent and well worth any amount of money.  Tons of food (I had a LOT of leftovers- but then again the chicken cutlet sandwich is a heavy dish and very filling).  My boyfriend LOVED his meatball parm and the steak fries were done perfectly.  Just the perfect experience.  Please know that if you choose the meatball parm or chicken cutlet sandwich, dont expect to feel light after; this is definitely like comfort food so dont come here on a diet. \n\nAll in all, great job guys!!

When I confronted the barista about it, he broke it down for me (the \"sandwich\", egg white, and tomato were all separate costs).

Unfortunately, I stand dumbfounded by the experience I had there this afternoon. We were offered a free small cup of coffee with our 20 minute wait time for a table of two, which, in my opinion, a wait at any breakfast spot is to be expected on New Years Day. After waiting about 40 minutes, we were told our table would be ready in \"under five\" and waited an additional 10 minutes. For the extensive wait, a barista downstairs offered us a complimentary muffin, which was an appreciated gesture. \n\nAfter finally being seated, our bespectacled waiter asked us if we wanted a coffee or a beverage outside of the water on the table. We asked for two coffees with cream. After waiting 5+ minutes for our coffee, the waiter came back to our table profusely sweating and again asked if we wanted coffee. We let him know we wanted two coffees with cream and were ready to order our food. He replied \"oh great easier for me! What can I get you?\" Our coffees arrived soon after without cream. After waiting about ten minutes for the cream, we realized it must have been forgotten so we politely asked our waiter for it and his reply was \"in a minute.\" We then asked a neighboring tables waitress for cream who immediately brought it over from where our waiter was standing when he said \"in a minute.\"\n\nAt this point it had been about 20 minutes since we placed our order with our waiter. The neighboring table, that ordered after us with the other waitress, had been eating their meal for at least 5 minutes. We considered getting up and leaving but didn't feel it was the right thing to do and assumed our food was on its way out. Our waiter then approached the table and asked if we had any questions. We stared back at him mystified, so he added \"about the menu.. or are you ready to order.?\" We reminded him that we already ordered and he proceeded to itch a strange rash on his neck (with a hand that was so scabbed up it looked like it was caught in a garbage disposal) and asked if we placed the order with another staff member. At this point, we told him we had placed our with him a little more than 20 minutes ago. Knowing our order never made it to the kitchen, we decided to get up and leave. The waiter laughed anxiously and we assured him it was okay, but neither of us have ever experienced something like this before. \n\nI can't really speak to the quality of the food here because I unfortunately did not get to really try it. While some staff members were super accommodating and helpful, others seem unable to appropriately handle the stress of the job.", "date": "2020-01-02 03:34:26", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 4, "average_stars": 2.4, "yelping_since": "2016-08-24 12:36:24"}}

Let me share you the reasons I feel this way:\n\n(1) The wireless is reliable, even when the place is packed with Penn students.  Part of the reason is that it is within range of the Penn wireless, so the students don't overload the store's wireless.\n\n(2) There is lots of seating.  Even when it's busy, I'm usually able to find a seat...and if it's not busy, I have no trouble finding a seat within range of an outlet, if I want to use my laptop.\n\n(3) Lively, but professional decor.  Not as corporate as Starbucks but a lot sleeker than most of the other coffee shops around the area.\n\n(4) They sell bananas.  I like that.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I find annoying about this place:\n\n(1) No mugs, only disposable cups.  I find this is a huge omission.  I love drinking from a ceramic mugs.  Saxby's does use biodegradable, compostable cups, which is great. (They do not draw enough attention to this fact, IMHO), but I still really love having a ceramic mug to drink from.  If you want one here, you need to bring your own.\n\n(2) This place only gives one tea bag when you get a large.  Some Saxby's give two even for a medium tea.  I find this to be a bit cheap, and it's a major factor in me being less enthusiastic about coming here.\n\n(3) The baked goods and food...it's not really all that amazing, and kinda overpriced for what it is.  A number of the other coffee shops around have really top-notch food for similar prices.\n\nAll this said?  My complaints are minor, I like this place a lot.

Highlights from this week: Curdled creamer (nothing like seeing solid in your coffee), eggs not cooked all the way through, warm yogurt parfaits. \n\nThe coffee: Signature tastes pretty much like bitter water. Occasionally tastes good but I generally avoid. If you're looking for coffee with taste, stick to dark. That isn't to say that it's particularly good tasting, but it's a step up from signature. The flavored coffee is variable. Sometimes it's great, other times it can make you want to vomit. I don't bother with specialty drinks because of the prep time and poor service\n\nThe food: The breakfast sandwiches are bearable but given the service I never order them. Very poorly put together and fall apart as soon as you pick them up. Bacon was pretty bad last time I had it. The muffins are too sweet but edible. The bananas are never in the proper state of ripeness. They're either christmas-tree green or they look like they have leprosy. I really wish they would actually put the cream cheese on the bagel when they make it. To charge an extra dollar for 2 packets of cream cheese and then just give it to you is embarrassing. I'd be willing to do it myself if it didn't cost extra. Bagels are seldom any more toasted than lukewarm. Parfaits are typically left in the front for days on end and as such get warm/soggy after the first day and are disgusting thereafter. The frozen yogurt is actually pretty good most of the time. Lunch sandwiches are unremarkable and somewhat bland. I don't think they're as \"Artisan\" as their menu claims. Generally speaking, everything is a bit too expensive for the quality offered. \n\nAmbience: The size of the space is great. However, about a third of the tables are coming loose and falling apart and having spilled my coffee several times from the unbalanced tables, I know now to test every table before sitting there. There are entirely too few outlets for the amount of kids that come here to study. It turns into a jungle of overextended power cables by midday during finals. There are about 5 tables that people will kill for because of outlet proximity. I remember seeing something about Saxby's taking out outlets because of the tripping hazard but this has likely exacerbated it. The music is absolutely atrocious. I despise it. This very well may be my least favorite part of the Saxby's experience. The acoustic channel plays the same 5 songs over and over and over and they're all awful. Totally unbearable. Put the crooner channel or jazz standards channel or even the country channel on. Anything is better than this. With that said, there's usually enough space for me to find a table, which is nice. Couch seating area isn't bad either. However, I hate it when the banks/consulting firms take up 5-6 tables for their coffee chats. I can't comment on sanitation-- I've never seen a mouse or an insect in here so I assume it's good. Wifi is always functional but I usually stick to the Penn internet because my computer defaults to it. \n\nThe Staff: I apologize in advance for anything that may come across as gratuitous vitriol. In a word, incompetent. Just yesterday I attempted to buy a bottle of soda during a low-volume time of day. There were 3 people in front of me in line. It took 15 minutes. Are you kidding me? They are consistently bad. The only exception here is the Asian man whose name escapes me at the moment. It should not take 10 minutes to put a bagel in the inefficient toaster there and put it in tin foil and hand it to me. There's really no excuse, especially since they refuse to butter/put cream cheese on. About half the staff speaks minimal english, making ordering rather difficult. The ordering area at the front tends to go unstaffed for minutes at a time. Organizationally flawed beyond comparison. Prep time is prohibitively long and as a result I won't order anything requiring more than basic preparations. They seem to be understaffed at critical times and overstaffed during downtime. None are particularly friendly or seem to care that much. \n\n\nNonetheless, I am here almost every day. In the end, it's functional and I haven't gotten food poisoning yet. The convenience factor of living two blocks away is indisputable. Moreover, it's cheaper and bigger than Metropolitan and  has wifi, a major shortcoming of metro. I know what to expect when I'm there and so I'm very seldom surprised by the shortcomings I encounter. I get that nothing's perfect, but I also don't think Saxby's is trying particularly hard either.", "date": "2012-12-09 16:30:24", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 11, "average_stars": 4.45, "yelping_since": "2012-12-09 15:42:07"}}

I'll post it here:\n\n I went in for my regular drink (which I pretty much get everyday, Monday through Friday) which is a Nutty Irishman Frolatte. This morning, I noticed it was taking a while to make my drink (at least 10 minutes) but I come here so often and have a frequent Go Card that I figured they were a little behind. When the woman handed me my drink, I immediately noticed there was no coffee in it (it was just blended ice and milk) so I informed her (in case she was training or new) that this drink wasn't right and that it normally comes with coffee. Her response was \"oh, you have to ask for it\" to which I promptly informed her, that \"no, I order this drink every single day and it always comes with coffee.\" Why else would it be called a fro-latte? Attitude aside, she said she would fix. However, what I watched was her basically pour hot espresso onto the top of the milk/ice combination she had made me, and handed it back. It was not blended, mostly warm now, and tasted pretty awful.\n\n I tried to inform her again, or any other employee standing by, that this wasn't right and I was immediately ignored. Finally, after 10 minutes of standing there with my messed up drink that I had already paid for--the gentleman who works there (i'm not sure his name, but I believe he is of Asian ethnicity) told me he would make me a new one. While he's making it, I was subjected to listening to the other baristas talk about me, stare at me, and discuss what was going on which made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The service I had was absolutely horrendous to say the very least. I was not only appalled by the fact that this employee not only messed my drink up once, but TWICE, and instead of having the decency to apologize--stood there and gossiped about me with her fellow co-workers. The ONLY person who was helpful and apologetic was the man who fixed my drink. Never mind the fact that I'm a regular customer, but no business can expect to develop regular customers if this is the sort of service they receive. I have worked in the restaurant/service industry nearly my entire life and I would have been immediately fired if I ever behaved in the way that these employees did today. I'm not seeking to get anyone in trouble, I just hope that this can be rectified among your employees otherwise I can't anticipate being a customer for much longer when I can just go to the independently owned coffee shop down the street.", "date": "2014-04-23 19:43:37", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 15, "average_stars": 3.25, "yelping_since": "2012-06-19 05:28:10"}}

The service is always incredibly slow and there are lots of language barriers, but I always thought the people were nice, and that the drinks were exceptionally good.   Unfortunately Saxby's just made my morning a bit more hectic than necessary.  I went to Saxby's yesterday in person to place a catering order for this morning.  I wanted bagels, fruit and coffee for 5 people, for a 7:45am pick up.  I was told that the \"fruit order didn't come in that early in the morning\", so I had to do the yogurt parfait, which was fine.  I prepaid with the UPenn credit card (this was for Penn Dental Medicine which is in the building directly behind the store).  I called 30 minutes before pick up (7:15am) and spoke with Geetha (the manager), she was very difficult to understand on the phone, but she eventually figured out that I was the 7:45am catering order.  She told me that they do in fact have fruit, so I told her I would add that and take away half of the parfaits.  When I arrived at exactly 7:45am, NOTHING was ready.  I waited, and took things over to the meeting (which was to start at 8am) as they were ready.  Coffee first and the fruit / yogurt.  I was told they don't have plates.. which is confusing, because they have bagels, what was I supposed to do, have people at the meeting eating the bagels off of the table?  I came back and told them that there wasn't any cream for the coffee.  At this point Geetha announced to the whole store that \"because I was in such a rush, and I was late, that I forgot the cream\"... this was incredibly rude AND INACCURATE!  After I gathered all of the items that were supposed to be ready at 7:45am, it was now 8:05am and the meeting had already started.  I actually owed them a little money since the fruit cups are more expensive than the yogurts.  So when I paid I very calmly said to her how rude it was that she said I was late, when in fact they were late.  At that point she told me that my pick up time was 8am... this is not at all true.  I confirmed it two or three times with her.  Fortunately this means I never have to use Saxby's for any Penn Dental orders again, but I can't believe that is how they prepare to-go or catering orders.  \nLesson Learned:\nIf you are coming here for a drink, and you are not in a rush, this place is fine and the drinks are good.

But the bourgeois bohemians leave nothing in their wake, so the Italian mom-and-pops that don't close will simply adapt with the times and start going upscale (and probably make a killing for the people who came to the nabe seeking something authentic, all the while squelching it through the higher rental rates that they command).\n\nEnough of that though.

However, I noted on the order that I am allergic to cilantro, so they omitted the guac and salsa (which in hind sight is kind of sucky because both of things are delicious if you don't ruin it with cilantro...I digress).

I would begin by saying something like \"Meh,\" but I really, really @###ing hate it when people say \"Meh.\"\n\nI'd like to give this place three stars or at least two and a half but as I'm bound by whole numbers it's getting two for now.  Upon moving to the area I had high hopes for the place since it seems to be fairly non-cliquey and serves a wide variety of things, including breakfast all day (and who doesn't like breakfast all day?).\n\nUnfortunately I'm just not that impressed with the food.  I had the \"turkey reuben\" on my first visit.  If you want to reinvent the reuben go ahead, but at least do it well.  It was served on triangles of pita bread (??), contained almost no sauerkraut and dressing and had a lot of cheese.  So basically this wasn't a reuben at all, it was a half-assed quesadilla on pita without salsa.\n\nA couple of other times I've had their breakfast fare and found it to be pretty mediocre.  I don't think they use high-quality ingredients.  The worst of all was today when I got a brownie from the pastry case and it was the worst brownie I've ever had in my life, extremely dry with a cardboard taste.  I asked the guy working behind the counter to throw it away.  He was nice enough to offer me something else, but I just decided to cut my losses, take my latte and head down to Artisan Boulanger/Pastissier for a real pastry.\n\nI must say that at least I've found all the staff very friendly there, including the aforementioned guy, who I'm pretty sure has some nasty b.o., but at least he's accommodating.  I'm not saying I won't return.  It's a close, easy breakfast.  I haven't had their coffee but have no complaints about the espresso drinks.\n\nSide note:  they need to adopt a no-shirt, no service policy.  I was in there a few days ago and the presence of a shirtless bozo-the-clown-haired hipster really brought down the ambience for me as a customer.\n\nAs another reviewier mentioned, we seem to have a Hobson's Choice between this place and B2 (which I also don't care for).

Amidst the sea of pretense that you typically encounter in Philadelphia coffee shops, it's refreshing to come across a cafe that is relaxed, has a really nice and open atmosphere, and doesn't have a staff who looks like they just came back from the most recent show at Kung Fu Necktie. \n\nIt really is the entire package. Black & Brew has really good coffee, and their prices aren't ridiculous (unlike a certain B2, cough cough). While I typically stick with plain black, they offer creative fancy latte drinks and a variety of smoothies which you can amp up with all sorts of healthy things if you so choose. They also have really good food, which ranges from simple to decadent. The prices are fair, and while the portions aren't super huge, it's enough to fill you up and make you feel like you're getting your money's worth. Honestly, my favorite thing to get there is a simple bagel with hummus and a tomato slice because whatever they do to their hummus is awesome. The hint of cinnamon - and it really is just a hint - is something I would've never thought to put in hummus but it's sooooooso good. Also - they have a list of weekly rotating specials so things are always exciting in terms of food. \n\nBlack & Brew is also really community oriented. They offer classes on all sorts of topics, and I believe the one coming up next is with a nutrition counselor or something about helping people break a sugar addiction. Along with that, local artist and Philadelphia celeb Isaiah Zagar's famous murals line the outside walls (but really, where isn't he these days?), while neighborhood artists get the chance to line the inside with their up-and-coming great works. \n\nI'm taking off a star for two reasons, though. The first is the hours. They aren't open past 7pm during the week, and 4pm on the weekends. I'm the type of person who can't study in my apartment because I associate my apartment with laziness and doing nothing, not school work, so it's kind of a bummer when one of my favorite cafes isn't open late enough for me to get a caffeine fix prior to a study session. I'm not suggesting staying open to midnight, but 9 or 10pm would be greatly appreciated (this is a nod to 90% of cafes, to be honest). Secondly, I was in their yesterday studying for a test in the early afternoon and they kept blaring music that would make more sense being played in a club, not a cafe (Rhianna? Katy Perry? T-Pain? Come on now). I know I said that I like how this place is lacking in pretense, but perhaps that's a double-edged sword because I would've killed for something more mellow and folky.

The coffee was quick and delicious.  I would describe the coffee as a rich medium roast. They also have an espresso machine and can make you any variety of specialty coffee drinks.  The bagel was decent (after four years of living in NYC, I have some bagel snobbery issues)--they have several options--I went with everything.  The veggie sausage was so good (and convincing) that I checked several times to make sure I wasn't eating pork.  The egg was scrambled (I wish there was an option to get it over-easy--though I probably could have if I asked) and the cheese tasted like cheddar.  Overall the sandwich was huge, relatively cheap for a non-fast food restaurant (it was ~$6 total for the coffee and sandwich), and good.  My wait time from ordering to walking out the door was probably around 7 minutes--not bad at all for a busy Saturday morning.\n\nI will definitely be back again to sample what looked to be a delicious lunch menu.  They offer \"daily\" specials on their web site, as well, so you can check out the changing menu before you go.", "date": "2014-04-14 17:32:51", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 306, "average_stars": 3.82, "yelping_since": "2012-01-26 14:10:06"}}

The first thing I noticed when I stepped in is how crowded everything was. The front is crammed full of small tables and there were barely any room to walk at all. Each table is tiny and definitely challenging to fit more than a plate and a cup of coffee. It's also very loud, which was to be expected when there are so many people, but even in the afternoon when the lunch-time crowd had left, there was still the loud music being blasted here. While I had a decent amount of work done and the wifi was reliable, it wasn't a super pleasant experience by any means, between maneuvering my coffee and laptop on such a tiny table to try to hear myself think over the loud conversations, I think I would give this place a pass the next time I want to work at a cafe.\nOn another note, their breakfast and lunch menu looked quite comprehensive, so maybe come here if you just want food.

The wife, babe and I came here about a month or 2 ago for brunch and we both had the huevos rancheros. The place was super busy, but even still, I was impressed with the service. Our waitress checked on us a bunch and was super nice even though we were outside. \n\nI was excited about our food choices at first because gluten free cornbread is not easy to come by! But alas, this was not cornbread nor was this a \"special.\" More like unspecial corn flavored styrofoam. The rest of the food was alright, but is it really that hard to fry up some eggs? The only positive thing was that there was a lot of food so at least we left feeling full. \n\nThe second time was today. The place was empty, so no one was in a rush. We walked in to the person at the counter loudly sighing, slamming down the phone and then immediately looking at us. She then started complaining about telemarketers to us as if we told them to call.....cool bro. Anyway, we awkwardly laughed at the complaints and ordered. I got the paleo hash with a green smoothie and the wife got a grilled cheese and a la colombe iced latte on tap. \n\nLiterally everything we got was a fail. The only things that were hot on my plate were the eggs and bacon. The potatoes were soggy and tasted like they were cooked hours before and then quickly thrown into a pan to warm. The mushrooms were either from a can or also cooked hours before or both. The red pepper was the worst offender of all and was again either out of a can or was just on its way out. There was supposed to be salsa, but I only saw 2 tiny pieces of tomato and maybe a 1/4 of a teaspoon of watery red sauce. Also, there were no apple slices on the plate at all....though I doubt it would have helped. My smoothie definitely had no green powder in it and it most definitely did have ice. I'm going to assume it was a half of a banana, a lot of ice and a couple of blueberries. It was also not blended all the way so since I didn't have a spoon handy, I drank a few sips and quickly gave up trying to suck a chunk of banana through the straw. \n\nMy wife's grilled cheese tasted fine but as you can see in the picture, it was tiny! I'm going to assume they used only bread ends since there is no way that was supposed to be the regular size. Her coffee was also literally one sip of coffee and 98% ice. Basically $5 for air. Thanks. \n\nTo top it off, the person at the counter was really unprofessional. She was dragging her feet around the restaurant muttering to herself for a while, tripped a couple of times (which is fine...I'm clumsy as well) and then accidentally dropped something on the floor and yelled out \"UUUGGHH PUT A BULLET IN MY HEAD!\" I understand having a shit day, but dude really?

My fiancee and I were left standing around waiting until we figured out the ordering procedure ourselves. We ordered and were told to bring the number to any table, but weren't told that coffee wouldn't be brought to the table. The host left for a break shortly after our food came. The food was above average. The kitchen staff was very nice and when she dropped off the food she let us know that the coffee had to be picked up, but the attitude of the barista was standoffish and incredulous when I explained that we didn't realize that we were supposed to pick up the coffees from the bar. The barista didn't say a word and just stared at me while pouring the coffee. The great design and mood setting of the decor of this spot was undercut by the negativity, poor service and confusing ordering mechanics.

This cake was so good..the handmade whipped cream the fresh stawberries nice moist shortcake...so good..yum.,So I asked Miss daughter O mine how about this for a birthday cake and she emphatically said yes. Mind you she is super particular and funny about food so I was excited that she was excited about the cake. So I put in an order for the next day...paid $36 bucks and left. Fast forward to the next day...we picked it up...got it home and imagine our surprise when we saw that the entire cake had chocolate shavings or whatever all around the sides I mean a substantial amount of these chocolate curls.Huh?? No  one mentioned chocolate curls..shavings nothing..no one said Miss when you order a strawberry shortcake its totally different than what we make for individual servings in the bakery. The lady who originally sold us the slice asked if we ever had their strawberry shortcake before and we said no..she then said oh you both are going to love it. Hence, why wouldn't anyone mention these chocolate curls on ordered cakes..people do have allergies or some people just don't like chocolate shavings on a cake!!  Especially when you ate it for the first time it didn't have shavings all over it!!!The cake seemed dry too..it wasnt the same. So I'll just stick to the slices from now on. I'd rather spend $6.50 on a slice that Ill eat than $36 on a dry ass chocolate shaved cake that went in the garbage! SMDH!! Total waste....Oh and yes I did call ...no sorry no apologies no discount ....  just you can order it next time without shavings...and people love the shavings Grrrrr.... How would you know to order without shavings if you're not told it comes on the efffn cake????!!!!!!! And I'm not all people by any means and that especially holds true for my daughter too!!

I grew up in a family of bakers and I bake a lot, so my standards are pretty high. I find that a lot of bakeries overbake nearly everything, and that problem is compounded by the fact that most places let their baked goods sit for way too long before discarding or discounting them. Although I can't speak for how long things stay on the shelves at Swiss Haus, I can say that they do a good job of baking things properly. Their traditionally dry cookies and pastries are a bit on the dry side (though not in a bad way), and the things that should be moist (like brownies or cupcakes) are moist. This alone puts them ahead of 90% of the bakeries I've been to.\n\nI also really liked that Swiss Haus has a good variety of baked goods. My personal favorite is the devil's food cupcake, and there are a lot of great cakes, cookies, and brownies. I took some stuff home to my parents in Illinois on a recent visit, and my dad went nuts over the chocolate peanut butter brownie. This would be the moist stuff, and nearly everything I've sampled has been pretty good.\n\nOn the dry end of the spectrum (and oddly enough, the baked goods almost seem to be arranged in order of moistness to dryness, from left to right), there are a number of cookies and pastries to choose from. If you don't like dry cookies, you probably won't like most of what this place has to offer. The only cookie I've eaten here that was moist was the black and white cookie, and it was pretty delicious - especially the white side. The rest are harder, like the kind of cookies someone might eat with their tea or coffee. You can get them individually, or by the pound. I'm guessing the larger cookies might be a bit softer, but I've yet to sample them all.\n\nIf you're looking for traditionally Jewish/Eastern European baked goods, you'll find a reasonable selection here. I'm not sure if it varies by when you come in, but I've seen a variety of apple pastries, hamantaschen, and rugelach in their cases. If you're vegan or gluten-free, you'll find a FEW options, but not a ton. It's a bakery, what do you expect? I'm also not sure what their procedures are in terms of avoiding cross-contamination for gluten-free items, so if you have a serious medical need to avoid gluten, you might want to call ahead. \n\nThe only things I don't like about this place are the fact that there aren't more \"fancy\" cookies, especially very moist and soft ones, along with the fact that the staff is very hit or miss in terms of friendliness. Most of my experiences have been great, but there were a couple times I felt like they seriously wanted to shove all the customers out the front door.

I absolutely love their pecan diamonds (basically pecan pie bars), raspberry walnut croissants, almond cream croissants, apricot/raspberry twists, and their cookies. They tend to be a little pricey, but it's quality comfort dessert food, so it's worth it. The ladies working behind the counter, owner Jim, and head chef Donna are always nice.\n\nI recently tried their vanilla cronut.

I don't like kicking something when it's down, but it was such a crappy cronut and I discovered that the place was closed a week later that I didn't bother writing a scathing review for it. To think that Crumbs started in my hometown, too! Blasphemy. Anyways, Swiss Haus' cronut was the complete opposite. The layers were flaky and soft and the outer part crisped perfection. I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers.

I got a specialty pastry called a \"marjolaine,\"  a chocolate/chocolate cupcake, a hazelnut cake slice, and a complimentary double chocolate brownie-cookie drop with vanilla glaze (because I actually came a little under the $10 and they wanted to make up for it.)  Very friendly service from the one woman I dealt with on a Thursday afternoon.\n\nI ate the cookie first. Very \"meh.\" It was dry except for the embedded chocolate chips. You can make much better at home using the Baker's Chocolate Drops recipe found on the back of their unsweetened baking chocolate, very easy to do, just add a generic confectioners glaze.\n\nNext I tried their specialty marjolaine, priced at $4.99, so I expected it to be good. This is a four layer hazelnut meringue filled with hazelnut and chocolate cream, a bit of jam, and covered with a chocolate glaze. Again, I was underwhelmed and had a hard time pinpointing why. Ultimately, I found it to be too rich and too sweet (half a slice made me sick to my stomach) but without a whole lot of actual flavor. The chocolate glaze quality was pretty good though. \n\nNext I tried the cupcake. And I found myself asking, what do the following have in common:\n1. Sahara\n2. Mohave\n3. Death Valley\n4.

If you want cupcakes, go to Brown Betty. End of story.\n\nFinally, the hazelnut cake square. Again, a lot of airy sweet nothingness, very unsatisfying. (In fact, the bakery box, when it held just the cupcake and cake square, weighed almost nothing. The marjolaine was the only hefty pastry.)\n\nThis place reminds me of many of the local Italian bakeries, because their cakes tend to be a lot of airy sweetness as well.

The exterior is very stereotypically Old World, what I would expect to find in a (touristy) mountainous town in Europe. But it took me about...3 years?...to finally walk into this traditional bakery, that has been in CC longer that I first realized.\n\nOne reason I never walked in was because you can't see inside - and it makes a big difference to the average passerby to see what they may be walking into. The interior is incredibly nondescript and in stark contrast to the bright red exterior with its white trimming. It's also quite large, and if I recall correctly there are a few seats available for customers. The counter spans two sides, one length filled with their cookies and another countertop holding their mini pastries, cakes and cupcakes. I had perused the Yelp reviews at one point and had heard mixed things about their signature dessert cake, so instead of getting that I decided to go basic because if a bakery can't do simple, classic baked goods then there's a problem with everything else. I picked up a chocolate cupcake and several different cookies to share with my fiance after dinner that night.\n\nI tried the chocolate cupcake first because I am the cupcake queen (according to fam and friends), and was instantly disappointed.

I was searching on Ritual and found that they partner with them (so I could order online). I originally ordered a hot chocolate with 2% milk, a chocolate muffin, and a chocolate chip brownie. About two minutes into my order, I noticed on my computer screen that it stated my order was cancelled, because there was no 2% milk. I decided I would just go to the store and change the milk (perhaps do swim or almond milk). When I arrived at the store, the employee was SUPER nice (this is the reason why I gave this visit three stars and not two). He told me that they cancelled the order because they did not have two out of the three products that I wanted, and that there was no way to contact me. (Does Ritual not provide the contact number of the customer in the event something is out of stock??) I asked if I could have the hot chocolate with skim milk and the employee said that the only kind of milk they had was whole milk (which was fine, I still requested him to make it for me). As for food, I just stuck with getting a brownie (on the website, they listed multiple types of brownies, and I originally wanted the \"chocolate chip brownie\" but I got a regular brownie with chocolate icing on top and sprinkles). The employee told me to put it through on Ritual again (since the first order never went through). I did not have the app on my phone, and had to do it through the phone internet browser (which thankfully loaded up quickly). Once I refreshed the page, I saw that they did update it with saying there was no 2% milk left in stock. Now let's talk about the taste of these products. Since the hot chocolate was made with whole milk instead of 2% or skim milk, I was expecting it to have a more richer/thicker taste. Instead, my hot chocolate was barely warm (almost room temperature??) and only had a small hint of chocolate. It tasted like I was drinking watery milk. I can't imagine if I had the skim milk what my hot chocolate would have tasted like if I had less thickness. As for the brownie, I wasn't a huge fan of it. I did not enjoy the consistency of the brownie, and would have preferred the icing to be more fudgy.

Before I write about what I did not like let me tell you that the cakes taste amazing and I have tried multiple flavors and I just love it.\n\nLet me start from the beginning - I went here to place an order for customized cake and the Lady staff told me oh you need to email on this id and then only place the order. I cannot tell you the exact cost etc...So I emailed the cake I wanted to order and the reply I got on that was that ya come over anytime to the shop and you can place the order. I had to visit twice to the bakery which was not necessary only if that LADY STAFF would have given me quotes that time itself as I knew what flavor and customization I was looking for.\n\nSecond I did not know the difference between printed vs drawing customization, I was told it is not much difference and since drawing had additional $10(apart from $20 already paying), I decided to go with printed. I was shown a few pictures there by another GUY STAFF and the printed cakes did look very nice and close to hand drawn. I was convinced and I ordered for it to this Another STAFF. However when I went to collect the cake and saw it, I was disappointed as it looked like someone just printed the logos and stuck it on the cake. I ordered this customized (Broncos, Sriracha logo Cafe Mocha) cake. Also, I had asked for big Broncos logo to be in center and sriracha on up left corner. Both the logos were on the top and a big happy bday in center. While I expressed my disappointment to the LADY STAFF(I believe it was same lady I mentioned earlier), her immediate reaction was 'I did not take your order.' Woah..I am just expressing my disappointment, I paid $20 extra for customization and this just looked like a print page copy pasted. Also, doesn't matter who took the order, isn't it the staff responsibility for the entire cake shop or is it 1-on-1. I was very polite and I never asked for a refund or anything I just said 'I know nothing can be changed but I am disappointed with the looks of cake and also the logos were not as I asked for. She said that this is the biggest logo can get on such a cake.' Well I wasn't told about it when I placed the order. You need to tell me that when I was placing the order and not after I recieved it. She was rude and I just did not like her attitude..not at all a TEAM PLAYER. I don't know her name but I would say the reason I would not like to go here again is only because this LADY STAFF. I did ask if this printed logos were edible and she said Yes but honestly when I tried to cut the cake, it just wouldn't cut and came out like a paper to throw. Definitely not worth the extra $20 you pay for customization and besides it was a very special bday which was kind of disappoint as the cake was not upto the expectation.", "date": "2015-02-26 16:13:59", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"review_count": 278, "average_stars": 4.36, "yelping_since": "2014-06-11 14:04:51"}}

Yet I have not spotted any product here that comes even close to what pastries are like in Switzerland. I wonder if the people who run this place have ever tasted a Swiss pastry - or if they have - whether they even had the aptitude to perceive its distinctive qualities. \n\nWhile I've had a bite of a decent (albeit super dry) layered cake from this bakery, pastry arts are a pretty big deal in Switzerland, and I find it misleading to consumers to have \"Swiss\" in the name of a bakery whose offerings are as \"un-Swiss\" in every way as can possibly be. \n\nThat being said, the misleading name could be ignored if this bakery had some strong redeeming qualities. Unfortunately, I find it hard to think of any. The common theme among many reviewers is that the cakes tend to be dry - which means they either aren't made properly, or they've been sitting on the shelves for too long. \n\nThe quality falls far short of that of even the most mediocre amateur patisseries in Europe (and perhaps even Philly) in terms of appearance, taste, and ingredient quality. These people make beginner-level pastry students at the Restaurant school look like master pastry chefs, by offering lopsided unimpressive looking cakes that lack any artistic sophistication in taste, texture, and overall composition. \n\nThe cro-creme is interesting, so I'll give a star for offering something that you might not easily find anywhere else in Philly. However, that star is immediately taken away by the fact that this item drips in grease and is exceptionally dry despite its cream filling and greasiness. (FYI - for much tastier versions, go to NYC.) \n\nAnother redeemable area could be service, but this establishment again falls short of reasonable expectations. I came here on a slow morning to order a croissant before heading into my office. There were 2 workers and one lady in line, who was placing an order for multiple pastries. \n\nAfter waiting patiently for 5 minutes while the 2 workers made no acknowledgment of my presence, I gently asked one of the girls to help me get a croissant. I was in a bit of a hurry and only needed one item. \n\nAs someone who once worked in places (from busy pizza shops to high volume fine dining) where I easily took care of 5 customers simultaneously while offering eager and cheerful service to everybody, I did not see any reason for the worker at this counter to give me a dirty look and throw me a dried up croissant without saying anything. I've experienced much better service from Wendy's. (Granted, I've been to Wendy's only once in the last 4 years, so I am open to the possibility that Wendy's level of service is either better or the same.)\n\nThe high pricing is definitely not justified, given the quality. When I think of this place, I think of pretentiousness and blatant disrespect for the beautiful art of pastry-making, particularly Swiss pastry-making. If this place was called \"The Mediocre Not-at-All-Swiss Haus Bakery,\" I might add a few stars for honest self-reflection.", "date": "2015-01-05 04:48:59", "useful": 8, "funny": 6, "cool": 2, "user": {"review_count": 541, "average_stars": 3.96, "yelping_since": "2011-07-07 20:10:35"}}

While his choice of words in asking me to do so is questionable (which might explain why he did not post it publicly), he did productively clarify that the name of the bakery was not entirely up to him, and that the name was registered by the original owners of the bakery, who were actually from Switzerland. \n\nIt then follows, from my own reasoning, that perhaps the preservation of this name acts more as a preservation of a local brand, rather than a description of the products sold at this bakery. For this reason, I will add a star and I will give them the benefit of the doubt: that perhaps they are not using this name to advertise a level of quality that is actually greater than the quality of the products they sell.  \n\nHowever, I think it's important for Yelp reviews to provide users with a window into an experience to help them make informed purchasing decisions. Even business owners are consumers, at times, whether outside or within the scope of their business operations. And I am sure they would also prefer to see a useful collection of feedback about a business before making transactions, rather than spend their money blindly. In my case, I made fair payments for products that were not worth the price I paid. The service was terrible, but there is a way to address that, if they are interested in progress.\n\nThe owner wondered why I returned to his store if I initially had a bad experience. It did not occur to him that perhaps I wanted to find out whether that was an isolated incident or a pattern, and that if it was an isolated incident, then I would gladly return to show my support for a small business. This is not hard for me to clarify: \n\nI initially tasted a very dry custom-made layered cake from here at a birthday party. Instead of completely dismissing this bakery after the first bite, I just made a note of this in my mind. At some later point, I came in to try a cro-creme out of curiosity and convenience, as this bakery is conveniently located on the block across the street from my office building. I cannot lie about the fact that I regretted spending $5 on a pastry that was very dry and greasy. Again, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and came back for a croissant, which again, was the driest croissant I've ever tasted in Philly. (There was another time I came in because I was hungry and this was one of the closest places for food, and I was also given a very dry almond croissant.) Given that dryness is a consistent quality of these baked products in my experiences as well as that of other reviewers, I really don't see how unfair it is to say so. \n\nThe owner also wondered why I mentioned the Restaurant school and speculated that I might be affiliated with them or that might have written a \"petty and misplaced attempt at revenge.\" I am not sure how he came to this accusation, or why he thought that addressing a customer in this manner would be better than owning up to and addressing certain areas of improvement in the quality of his establishment. \n\nHowever, to clarify the above reference, my only \"affiliation\" with the Restaurant School is that I stop by their bakery sometimes to purchase pastries and coffee, and their pastries (made by students, to my surprise) are always delicious. In my prior review, I was simply expressing my surprise at how pastries made by beginner-level pastry students have been consistently tastier than ones made by a long-established bakery.

Chosen as for the test was the flower-shaped butter cookie with the chocolate center, which all of the bakeries offer.     \n\nFirst place honors went to Rillings for its cookie's relatively soft crumb and clear butter flavor.   Our quibble was that the center dollop of chocolate was a bit sweet and hard, but overall it was a good cookie.   The other first place winner was Feasterville, whose cookie is very delicate and nearly disintegrates on the tongue (like any great shortbread).  One has to carefully transport Feasterville's cookies because they easily crumble in transit.  Again, the chocolate center was a bit sweet and hard.   Both Rilling's and Feasterville could elevate these cookies to epic status by replacing the chocolate frosting with a bittersweet ganache.\n\nSecond place went to Swiss Haus Bakery, whose butter cookies are a perennial household favorite.   The Swiss Haus version is much firmer than either than Rilling's or Feasterville's and it is less sweet.  To its credit, the Swiss Haus cookie's chocolate center is neither as sweet nor as hard as the first place bakeries' versions.

I arrived there having to use the bathroom very badly, and explained that I was going to order something, but I just had to use the bathroom first. But, they said they had just given the key to someone else. So I made the mistake of spending $4.50 on a smoothie and waited for 5 minutes, having to go even more. Then I walked back to knock on the door, and I realized that there were 2 bathrooms. But, the other one was also locked, so I assumed that one was also occupied and the key was taken.\n\nAnother five minutes passed. Finally, someone who appeared to not have a home (really I have no hate for Philadelphia's homeless population, I understand they are marginalized and also have to use the bathroom) and a woman who appeared to have all of her worldly possessions with her in the bathroom finally emerged. When I walked inside, I thought I was going to be sick, because it had one of the worst smells I have ever smelled in my entire life. This is also circumstantial, and not really Saxby's fault.\n\nThe reaction of the two employees working then was entirely Saxby's fault. They were incredibly rude to me when I requested to use the other locked bathroom, which at that point was apparently empty. One of them finally agreed to unlock it for me (why did only he have a key and why was it not available to customers?) \n\nSo I walked into the second bathroom, and it was also ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING ALSO, and smelled almost as bad as the first.

We tried to call several times houra beforehand to put in a reservation, but the phone kept going to an automated message and telling us to try again. With no luck, we decided to just go and try our luck. We found parking right away, but came in just after a couple of larger parties. We waited for our table with a couple of cups of coffee. \n\nBy the time our table was ready, our cups were empty, but we were distracted by the menus. But our coffee was never filled until we prompted the waitress. Once filled, I had a steaming cup, whereas my friend had a lukewarm, almost cold cup of coffee. We brushed it off and just ordered our food. We noticed our waitress greet another table nearby and list off specials that were not written on the regular or specials menu. She had never recited them to us and they sounded more enticing than what we had actually ordered since the menu had changed since our last visit. The whole restaurant just seemed to be more chaotic and disorganized than ever before. \n\nAgain, we had to prompt our waitress to fill our coffee for the second time, but it was almost already at the end of our meal. She had checked in with us once, but turned around before we had answered her and could ask her for something, which we then had to wait another 10 mins to grab her attention. \n\nAs for the food, I have had way better from them and elsewhere. Everything we had ordered was really bland and underwhelming. The only people who enjoyed the food were my younger cousins who like anything sweet or with pancakes. \n\nI might come back again, but I am officially turned off and unimpressed.

Despite its location on a weird block on Port Richmond, this spot was packed for Sunday brunch.  We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated.  It's nice to be able to have a good brunch spot close by without epic Sabrinia's-esc waits.  \n\nI had an omelet that was on special.  It was filled with cheese, and several kinds of peppers and onions.  It was a generous portion, probably a three egg omelet.  With the side of potatoes, it was honestly enough food to fill me up for the entire day.  Dining with my friend Bryana, she also ordered from the special board: eggs florentine.  She had a similar assessment as myself; the meal was delicious and served in generous portions.\n\nThere are two factors that impress me the most about Hinge: The coffee is excellent and served continuously, and the menu is extensive.  There were several great offerings on the board for specials that I didn't even take a serious look at the regular menu.  I could easily come back here several times in the future and have a lot of good, different options.  Hinge doesn't just do brunch, either, they have a good offers for all meals.\n\nBottom Line: Hinge offers quick service and meals at affordable prices.  It makes a great brunch spot that is (for me) close to home.  I've never been at night, but apparently Hinge also host small music events.  It would even make a great stop for a coffee shop, as it has a few small tables up front and a bakery case filled with mouthwatering desserts.

My companion had the scallops, which were nicely seared, a nice size, and just about perfect.  The duck too, was excellent.  The maple and sherry flavor was not too sweet or overpowering.  The breast was cooked fine.\nI have a problem with the sides.  Risotta was just rice.  I got a thing about risotto, and I watch enough food porn to know exactly what it should be like.  Creamy, not just a pile of rice.  Tasty rice, but plain old rice. (Ever see the movie \"The Big Night\" with Stanley Tucci and Tony Shaloub...it revolves around making risotto, great film.)  Parsnip potatoes were iffy.  I never had a  parsnip, they sound like something my grandmom would make if she ran out of rutabagas.  But they must be very mild, because I couldn't taste them.   My mashed potatoes stand on the plate like clay after five minutes, I don't expect theirs to.\nAnd the next time someone throws some wilted baby spinach on my plate, and calls it a vegtable of the day, I'm gonna freak.  Its wilted spinach!  Its sooo cheap.  You can't throw a couple of asparagus spears on there instead? For a $22 plate?\nThe dessert was probably delicious.  By then, I had some early signs of alcohol poisoning, so it went into a styro box and home.  It didn't last in my fridge longer than 5mins, so I will assume it was good.\nI really like the Hinge...the staff is nice, the food is generally very good, and its comfortable. I will be back again, many times I'm sure.

REALLY hungry... this past Saturday for good brunch food- and I couldn't have been happier to saunter into the Hinge Cafe.\n\nFirst impression- COOL!  The art on the walls could have kept me entertained for hours- lots going on (and all for sale).  I loved the vibe of the place.  It was cool, comfortable, and not particularly portentous.  Just good food- who can't get down with that?\n\nWe walked in and sat right down- which is an amazing thing on a Saturday morning at a place that has a reputation for being busy.  We had a great little table off to the side.  Our waitress brought us water immediately (i think she could read my rosy cheeks and knew not to spare a minute!), and then took our coffee/tea order.  My boyfriend went for a vanilla latte and it was delicious!  I went for an iced tea that was strong, tasty, and came with a big ol' slice of lemon.  When I got a lemon seed implanted in my straw, my waitress laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation, and hooked a sister up w a new straw :-).\n\nFor breakfast I ordered the skillet which came with 2 eggs my way (over easy) perched atop sauteed onions and green peppers, roasted potatoes and an abundance of cheddar cheese with 2 pieces of rye toast.  Everything was even more delicious than it looked.  Some of the potato slices were kinda on the huge side, but it sure didn't stop me from eating just about the whole thing... which from a volume perspective is asinine.  \n\nMy boyfriend had something (I was too busy chowing down to notice) that he enjoyed- i noted scrapple- 2 pieces cut thin cooked super-crispy.  I'm a vegetarian- but I haven't always been this way... and when I ate scrapple, i preferred it cooked this way, but noticed it wasn't the norm.  He seemed pleased as well.  Finally, his pancakes.

Hinge used to be one of my top 3 brunch places in Philly, but after my last visit, it has quickly dropped off my list completely.\n\nI was really looking forward to eating at Hinge again after not visiting for almost 2 years because.. life. I went with my BF and sister. My BF had the On the Border Skillet. My sister & I each ordered a Chai Latte, and for our food order, we had the Lite Bite Lunch Plate, which gives you the option to pick 2 or 3 options which includes soup, sandwich, and salad.  I had half the Chipotle Chicken Panini and a Garden Salad. My sister had the House Soup and Chicken Club sandwich. We shared a side of Cinnamon Bun Pancakes. Sadly, neither of us enjoyed our meal. \n\nThe Chai Latte was super foamy. At least half the mug was filled with foam, It tasted like a foamy milk latte with hardly any flavor. I didn't even taste the Chai at all. I was really disappointed in the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes. My BF & I had it plenty of times before. This time, it was different. The size was smaller, the texture was mushy, and it did not taste like how it used to. My Chipotle Chicken Panini was meh. It was a little dry and it lacked flavor. My sister did not enjoy her sandwich or her soup. The On the Border Skillet was really dry and... NOT in a skillet. There's a Breakfast Quesadilla on the menu for $9. It was essentially the same thing except you pay an extra $1 for the skillet in the name even though it wasn't in a skillet. Kind of sad & humorous if you ask me. It's either morale went down or everyone in that kitchen is new, maybe both? I don't know. \n\nThe service dropped as well. Our server was impatient and made us feel rushed when ordering. She seemed like she hates her job and it shows when she interacts with guests. There was a big party across from us and I witnessed one of the servers asking when the rest of their party was arriving and they said soon as they are already on their way. The server made it clear that she was annoyed and said \"I shouldn't have seated you since most of your party isn't here yet.\" I saw how appalled the guests were when she said that.

Looks like something out of a movie, super cute and old-timey.  Stereotypically hipster, if that makes sense.  I was greeted by one of the best selections of overflowing multicolored sweets poised in glass that I ever laid my eyes on.  I'm a visual learner, so if I can't SEE what I'm buying, I probably ain't gonna buy it (why TF do so many other bakeries not display all their shit?).\n\nAnyway, I also heard from a coworker that their breakfast sandwiches were dope, so I ordered to-go a turkey bacon/egg/cheddar on a bagel (\"Philly Muffin\") and a nice selection of 6 different carefully-chosen pastries (so hard to not just say, \"I'll take the lot!\").\n\nThe wait for my sandwich took longer than expected, but they were definitely busy with both in-house customers and Postmates/Caviar orders during the morning rush.  I was able to get a better look at all the different varieties of non-bakery foods they offered, as well as what looked to be really great, locally-sourced coffee.\n\nFor my sandwich and sweets it came close to $40 (yikes), but I would estimate that each pastry was probably like $4-5 each (they're MASSIVE), so makes sense, especially when I went in there no-holds barred on the budget.\n\nOverall, my sandwich was okay (I was a little underwhelmed actually).  The Philly Bagel (essentially a square English muffin, but seasoned like an everything bagel) would have been better on its own with just butter (it was too soft and I like a bit of a bite to my sandwiches, like an actual bagel or a kaiser roll).  The egg was cooked fine, but the turkey bacon was not crispy at all and too thick-cut.  Next time, I'd stick to something a little more classic.\n\nAs for those pastries, the bike ride to work then back home that night jostled TF outta them, so a few fell apart.  My absolute favorite was their ricotta/Italian wedding cookie. My mom and I have made these every year for Christmas since my birth and they've never come out that good - absolutely perfect.  Will probably go back and just get like a dozen of those.  Others were 2 cinnamon/raisin cookies, a tahini chocolate chip cookie, a strawberry oat bar, and a birthday cake blondie.

Yelp came to the rescue after a search for breakfast sandwiches yielded this little gem. The plan going in was for my husband and I to each get a breakfast sandwich and to take a (one) cookie and a (one) treat to-go to bring to my grandmother who we were visiting and has a sweet tooth. When we walked in our plans were completely de-railed because everything in the case looked so good! We each got a breakfast sandwich and a cold brew - he got a bacon egg and cheese on an everything philly muffin, and I got smoked salmon avocado toast on an everything philly muffin - which we ate at a table outside and both were fresh and delicious. Their \"serve yourself\" cold-brew was great, and I liked not having to explain to somebody how full I wanted my cup. That brings us to the sweet treats. They were sampling a cherry \"pop tart\" which was fantastic. I normally hate cooked cherries because they stop tasting like real cherries but this was lovely, not too sweet and still tasted like real fruit. We then got a Maple Oat scone, a chocolate chip cookie, something with apricot (bar maybe), and one other thing that I cant remember to go. When we got to my grandmothers and sat down for some sweets and tea every single item was delicious. The scone was traditional but not too dry, the apricot was a total winner - we were all fighting over the last bits, and the cookie while a touch too sweet had tons of chocolate and great consistency. I will say that we noticed that they had forgotten 1 of the item we ordered but we didn't check our order before leaving and also ordered in a such a scattered way that I can't really fault them for it.

I really was not expecting the level of goodness that came from this cookie.\n\nMy friends and I got to Philly super early on a Saturday and it was my duty to search for a breakfast spot.  Bakeshop on 20th was constantly coming up in all my searches, so we decided on here.  \n\nIt is an adorable little shop (literally, there's only about two tables inside and two tables outside) and 80% of customers coming in seemed like regulars.  The girls behind the counter knew a couple of customers by name.\n\nAnyways, the three of us decided to get a breakfast sandwich, which you can customize.  My friends decided to get it as is, but I opted to get mine on a croissant.  When I checked in on Yelp, I noticed that there was a deal to get any cookie for $1.  I mentioned this and showed it to the cashier, and picked the ricotta cookie.  So glad I decided on this.  The sandwiches took awhile to come out but we had that cookie to taste.  I split it 3 ways, so my friends could try it.  Let me tell you how blown away we were.  It's been 3 weeks since the visit and we are still talking about this cookie.  It was just the right amount of sweetness, so soft and chewy.  The bites with the icing part are event better!  You get that extra sweetness from the glaze.  Wow.  I don't know if there is a secret to how they make their ricotta cookie, but I'm about to try and make my own and they better turn out the same way lol.\n\nThe breakfast sandwiches came super fresh and piping hot.

The Bakeshop is a tiny little spot tucked away in Rittenhouse, but for the small place, people definitely know it's there. I was actually surprised at how short our wait was (maybe 5 min to place an order), but customers were in and out the entire time we were waiting for our treats to be ready. The staff was incredibly kind, providing recs to us as we were deciding what to order and sharing some insider tips (AKA follow them on Insta to see their specials for the weekend!). \n\nFor our eats, it was SO hard to make up our mind! To not completely overwhelm ourselves with sweets, my finac\u00e9 and I split the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. The egg was a fluffy patty, and the bacon was nicely crisped, all encased in a whole wheat ciabatta bread - not the most memorable breakfast sandwich, but solid. To indulge in the main attraction, we split a chocolate babka as well. Man, SO GOOD! They also offer fruit babka, but our eyes were set on the chocolate and I feel that we made the best decision :) It was so flaky yet dense (but not too dense) and chock full of melty chocolate. Truly a wonderful treat! The babka is quite filling since it is a bit dense, so highly recommend splitting it with a friend. We couldn't limit ourselves to just this treat though, so we snagged a chocolate chip cookie ($1 with Yelp check in!) and homemade pop tart (!) to go. The chocolate chip cookie was a no brainer with the coup, and it was pretty nice - big chocolate chunks with some sea salt on top encased in a thick cookie. Pretty standard fare, but quite good! But the pop tart...we originally weren't going to get, but when they told us it was a weekend special AND it was their last one (!), we had to get it. Strawberry was the feature for the week, and it was delightful. The crust was so flaky and it was iced with the perfect among of icing as to not overwhelm the pastry. The filling was incredibly fresh with actual pieces of strawberry bursting from the seams. So glad we were convinced to try it! \n\nOverall, we loved our Sunday AM at Bakeshop on 20th.

I lived a few weeks while she loved me.\" Humphrey Bogart, In a Lonely Place (1950)\n\nIt's one of the minor tragedies of my dessert obsessed life that I've never lived close to a great or charming neighborhood bakery.

In those days, the amazing baker Meg (of Nutmeg Cake Design) would share the kitchen and one could hope to run across fresh cupcakes baked from ingredients remaining from the wedding she'd catered to. That would be the special treat ... on top of all the other sweet treats!\n\nSadly, as I moved away, I could no longer be a regular here.

It's not crumbly or over/under-baked. I'm honestly unsure how such a perfect cookie could even exist. It's fairly rich and could easily be shared amongst two people if you're feeling generous. I had no problem polishing the entire thing before my breakfast even arrived at my table. I couldn't even manage to get a decent picture of the cookie (not that a photo would do any justice anyways) because I could not control myself from biting into it from the second it hit my hands. Additionally, check-in with Yelp and get the cookie for ONE DOLLAR, which frankly feels like robbery because it's just THAT good. \n\nI ordered the Salmon Special for $12. It was advertised as an English muffin, topped with fresh sliced salmon, cream cheese, capers, tomato, and onion. In my head, I pictured on of those small, store-bought English muffins. Uhm. No. It was a huge, whole-wheat, house made wonder packed high with tons of salmon. It was a heaping, delicious sandwich. I honestly could have taken half home for later, but again with the no self-control. I ate the whole thing and was full for the remainder of the day. \n\nIf you'd blink, you'd miss this little shop. It's it a super cute area just west of Rittenhouse Square Park. They've got a fresh selection of cookies, scones, and other goodies baked in-house on display in a glass case. I'd imagine it'd be impossible to make a wrong choice here. Everything is delicious tasting and easy on the eyes. You can tell it's made with fresh ingredients and lots of love.\n\nThe inside of the shop is small and can easily feel claustrophobic. There's a handful of stools and a couple of tables, but realistically, the entire shop is only equipped to comfortably seat about 6-7 patrons. I felt in the way as I waited for my sandwich. I ordered my sandwich to-go, but it took about 15 minutes to be ready. Fortunately, I grabbed a free seat and perused some of their hilarious pug-themed novelty books.
