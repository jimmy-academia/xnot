The Turkey Sausage-Egg-Cheese Sandwich was about as good as the coffee, unfortunately.\n\nSo, I I think its safe to say, the 4.8 rating comes from the vibe: Hate Trump.

Its really mediocre food.\n\nSo if you hate Trump this is the place for you. If you're looking to stage a late night protest this is the place to go.

Mind you, I went to Uncle Bobbies with the sole purpose of 1, seeing what all the hype was about, 2, enjoying a latte and 3, to purchase a book or two. Surely you can understand my disappointment when I saw what I thought was Uncle Bobbie's book selection. The cashier took my order and I was ushered to the side to wait for it. Instead of waiting, I walked to the back of the shop and it was as if the heavens opened before me!  There were books on top of books on top of great books! My inner bookworm started to do back flips! I was so excited. After retrieving my latte from the counter, I perused the book shelf, picked up \"Assata\" and found a spot on a comfy couch. For the next hour, I sipped and read while occasionally people watched. Uncle Bobbie's customers are just as diverse as its books selection. \n\nNow onto my review...\n\nUncle Bobbie's offers a diverse selection of books by African American authors, including children books, which is a major plus! Uncle Bobbie's is not the only bookstore in Philadelphia specializing in books by African American authors, but it offers something that the others don't...ambiance- a cozy, relaxing atmosphere! The front of the shop, decorated with a comfy couch and high back arm chairs looks more like a living room than a coffee shop. It makes sense that this black-owned business is perfectly nestled in the heart of Germantown. Great location and plenty of free street parking! I had been putting off visiting Uncle Bobbie's because I heard of how crowded it gets. I wanted to wait until the hype wore down. Not sure if the hype is over, but I went on a Saturday afternoon and although it was crowded, seats were available. My only dislike was the music playing in the background; it was a little too loud when you are trying to read, write or hold a conversation. \n\nThe menu selection and the prices are the typical coffee shop selections/prices.  I live in South Jersey so I can't visit Uncle Bobbie's as much as I would like to, but when I am in the area again, I will be sure to check in on Uncle Bobbie's !", "date": "2018-06-19 17:50:55", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "wjko_JEkgwydWiT-aIjKIg", "name": "April", "review_count": 103, "yelping_since": "2017-08-14 15:23:31", "friends": ["rOnsnJGYDvv36WF20qu0AQ", "pvU67d0hytJH2yUeghOqWQ", "NoAQUE5RZIEE9f3gedjNkg", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "u3o52o66yTFR6yn3LDaPXg", "Whv0YzmUIurI0PBCwokk0A", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "5U6p1dKQrBmBNjju1rBP2w", "-5yQtx2PBpG2D44RYGS63Q", "_tDsHb122SE9PUaTXzgrag", "NJAiZ1H4_F-V7BcjM1C_kA", "10nRuJtfeuZcK-oDw_cLjA", "ArUiR0k6YMT4eiiTpgJCWQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg", "ErwQeY88vtwnKyRkxWtNDw", "Y-huRl37VSgOhZM4drCrJg", "2-emzYMEFFSOcEBF6B-0NQ", "Gu_i42c5nD8uSYxIJeFNOA", "NMOxipsnXc6olWdHYzXiYA", "qKn9QCaZRwq-d4R4YkqsUw", "lh4-936qzBe9z12iwDgIrw", "_uXsvqMJYALJLaP0DaCWsw", "T7GOu_HC3u7xzJjQY691KQ", "YqjW3aqnM2fUyyDHYnuiiQ", "i--S-QNq-NofASU9KKHY0g", "EG40sFToZEzZa5C7aIAlSQ", "r9S0VYrdXJrdhfR7OXj8tA", "0ZaeH_Y0wVqJoM6pgfPh5w", "KMZDZqP__XpDKM_pqq6eYQ", "xPhdS_6JybtC_3K-aRJLyg", "dKFhfrSg8cNYtvbNOS0DgA", "jg26T4bwIN53M30FKsTf0Q", "6epFUwR8jn9Xx4F4rrr_4w"], "elite": ["2017", "2018", "2019"], "average_stars": 3.34, "fans": 6}}

Well, thankfully I was off from work and in the area and was so excited to give this spot a play. I love the quaint but busy pace of the place. The layout is excellent and provides a nice variety of options for customers to work, chill, people watch &/or find a good read. I like how the counter is situated at the front, it's out of the way of people working and easily accessible for those who may just be stopping in for a quick bite/drink. I didn't get to check out the back room but from the sound of it it seems like a nice, comfy living room type of vibe. There are multiple seating options throughout to fit every mood (counter seating, high top window seats, awesome high wingback chairs, tables for two, seating for one, sofas for small groups).\n\nI was a little hungry (when am I not, really) so I tried the egg white sandwich with a cup of hot chocolate. I'm a foodie so I was hoping for something freshly made, but the sandwich was pretty good.\n\nI am a cafe lover, esp when I need to get work done. While I do not live in nor frequent the area often, I could see me taking the drive up here when I have the time. Uncle Bobbie's provides an atmosphere of comfort, relaxation, and a small escape in the midst of the hustle & bustle of the city. It's almost perfection! Plus, the idea of supporting a local black business is really all the excuse I need ;-)", "date": "2018-01-09 19:43:47", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "DgC8Z8VmSAlWZpsc_XjbqQ", "name": "Des", "review_count": 245, "yelping_since": "2015-03-15 22:39:19", "friends": ["kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "TDNIX2g1jAOQw-MW5d_KAg", "Xu7itIAz90gMsN33mzbO9A", "mAAewuj6suMTi5eR5vN9ng", "aXLzJNf36s0gHlqUoC2Btg", "vTyyCbhAOXaKUYWCd0YgNQ", "VEsC22Y5RAdJyWrSfcSoMA", "t83WunzR6ygWR43ZtzlABw", "vJ3YiIUVwhshFBpQDRJhPQ", "SuF5-YVdyd4G0Pn9YY0HYQ", "r0M1dabKQYlgz-jzG316SA", "s2AVEcX83veC8iGNkIozYQ", "G89qIvLLFQmASYDI7HN59g", "UGbrL9hZUL1xR2d_7ZO1QA", "oP9Thpxa2K2X8SG7Pdewgg", "_ao1Y7W61e-fs80HE2TLbw", "FP8EwAQos22gXgq-xfV0jg", "gzFEtGS6f8_nY51FVy48AQ", "JYjCziZ4s9X39up7MfteUQ", "GLlNKPzs-1cAQcDD-gbfMA", "wFvqK31dqpscfWNPTU0lqw", "Hj9yrUSZFTTO8iqmecvRFA", "gW1xCCKVUzlrmNGhFiYjfg", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "0nJBXoihG3bKLlq5NnC8Rw", "zpEXnoGCcMqSszbAQ3EcYA", "rkIlSTZHJ6PsXBB4EYw2tg", "YOQQQ5lc1sbkz7EAUlRXAw", "eAYyPwGQ-Am-sOvCHI8Hqw", "gRhVUpdVxOoCtztWJosKSA", "zaN4abQ92vjQP4-ZWjZnYg", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "AZ4ld6wZ6Xo3En6EwsUIuw", "WrY_JWZBB9tYF00bhGjNxw", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "Wmux4GgQkNBGz4mb0BBT3w", "m-cHPauJVqvVrELnOG6RwA", "zzIN1qdtJJ7850oO2b7WNw", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "RIm6ErBGrdGFUyZJ4cgMDA", "lRRuTimITgwzoXLIM3g9qw", "gLdRm_vieK4tkdgrBjEeTg", "M9B-SSGKjLDLDaZO9U92Rg", "rFANUt3nNW1auqcQTILUGQ", "m1lA_ZjK1thqP3E-OZWtDg", "dedoDaI78Kp1bbYQFMyQxg", "JOZr-rLOgPqdBiZ2hG3aUA", "xaQz3eSbC-sGGT2Talf-Hw", "5PRirKmuiUjCUBCDnvq1Cg", "FlXBpK_YZxLo27jcMdII1w", "FNM3cyBEiHcC8fNhZBVbpQ", "hdUNzkqvCdsiqws0lzKsyg", "VS97UcKPIj0ye4EHJ-fLYA", "5qN309JwiJ8UGDUdkzA6fg", "fR5LINF3n685ah-HSfGSAQ", "MuBR9DD7o8Pk6-KxAAW5vw", "vzX-_CeXZlHOfzieGhrm4A", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "sFjHSF_ZZawiJKS4XF6FgQ", "YR4ITcqn-L2e_0QCSg0F1w", "1_2DkgyvN4Vy7gkb-XRA-w", "NcjnEw3HX-TjKebWBJLsCg", "NaaI8tUyd4ctrJuIGEIgUg", "LnFIWZM_l__4t8Qxj3pnOg", "UZqtHuHM8VVZbFoojBtBLA", "_hPjqzQDiyw1-4U_IAETpg", "K17847uudqPFPIjSPgxs2A", "OYZ_kaSN82mZ1U5dFpogcA", "EuMFWgEnd8HuQGxuUE8zpA", "D6ZLghgj27RXZtR5ihz47g", "TtuLyYy4Gf41XA2JUQgY8A", "zgRNIZ4J1QBhLthxH2AFAg", "0zLF0re9qfQ7ggp9Gnc6Sg", "KkG9234cqRbcRti59xEf9w", "eWolUZ0AVYOXcRgr_1YR7A", "Bp33D27pGfQdWQRypcADLw", "mrj2C0Ae4iraBAQeapwWYQ", "SXh4aszWbJaooYyE_bVWgQ", "g_zPdf1arEk9nDQ74sqzSQ", "GXeW9fnaPqoNhY5Ay71fIw", "1M9sUDnCY-wEVd7d8Q3B5g", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "vQumH_l3Bt0EvYWOVMXOmA", "T-nT2GoABpdw8RKd4ZyPFQ", "72Gx6SQXSE4Qmv30hfwxlw", "088RHnhAEANbj5oWlQF2wg", "esJDJaNrTs8owwDWHSyt8Q", "ZXcGgOazrPPz8uNTVncd6A", "Z3xmtABWhVLXzwyXqpZOBA", "LcIoiOIpc6jj6hkIbYXWuA", "YIlY03dS0YrJtba8N-tMGw", "JHOOhWAhBe1rmsT4J9T6RA", "ZcogXYI50Ja_6b4CdEG_0Q", "Bt1w9gOnkBSwfZKyVLTVWg", "nHKmFS5vcvhan33JW82FCg", "ynO2E2xuey8iT_q8y-Dy8Q", "G-pOIBeRXdxq8hqYDoFFfw", "W_YCkMLI0nudNNbvFARa-Q", "MiIhPqbV11A_rmDfCjVL9w", "9tIjFbmboV3ioyng_G2Pgg", "RnV6Ohrf8Td6GDKa167xxg", "_tDsHb122SE9PUaTXzgrag", "GDkzRIhGL4V0LH5T0WWJJw", "nh2sXYZpABxULPXVq7MLug", "mNKHKJ1rzq0DtHfL2bQ3Yw", "J17rvZ6jpzIQhR3tIhmXiQ", "95Tt-GahbfETvtbocXkQ4Q", "8l7mesDv8-jwWrsZVyCNxQ", "3WbaeDab6coCLx-krl7mxQ", "jvA1wx6vmJ_VVwMM2qzJNg", "mTkZ5SVXj9-z21qwkqwHaQ", "Q7A8j1LfrL79hEbKUYAO_A", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "ZZc0fO8CeqKMKsQR9__4Dw", "j8Ft1NHwZVzoe1nie7LRjw", "xq-XvQRpBH_XoZhTBP-t2A", "aYveEctPYcZiubXyEgLhTA", "cSTBzSqwWeFn2YKuZlx07g", "aBD7yfqrw96kZvfYYDEUfA", "f0Xd3SPyfYdqKqnwSXdePg", "SGlQUfmNE4XEg4vMpKk_Mw", "5g1_pIHDB6jgXez0w1xspg", "ens7LiIE4Cs4RjW5Mz65Mw", "MfWf3EKvDh3VLpaVzP0MpQ", "aaEr2-3Qaa4jo9rkjiqibA", "M1Kex2Enpu-d4R5dZHU0Ng", "1eAZVRHuV-0eqRIDaEWcnQ", "IuBDez6xJWAAA0yoxN4Ifg", "ZX9aq6fKbGaF6hXSnkDiAA", "R_5ncws-hDxcwp4jvXYtdA", "lsnImU4XHvOSRZqc11_PoQ", "wnLIHOjiV-nWqaHl6CmVkw", "JWeXuv2B9lRhiXBcIzsi2Q", "WPV1o2HqGV-uHhTi6_1rLQ", "26B5k-Oo8s0r0lERaHTKCA", "gRtDkEdF3rg2mbDetBcLng", "rNRqtp50e-oKbS10q6Q7Dg", "6Cq7MnY7n62HDmysaLWzXg", "L3lpkRQ0nH4VIclkEr9cnw", "v4WB-qGb4mSIOilHK6i-xg", "eV1HgZn6-ZymnBEp0UwLjg", "YbVVYXOmgiV-mjswQHN0ow", "IyVUEAKRV7BR9hvxfs0L0w", "0DW_kcLb5x2joMEVVpu2NQ", "XEwEdPIjryudxfU098wapg", "6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q", "pGmbV55YLG54t8r1W4F3xg", "XXDSnBwj1h0Y_sUO3O26Og", "jMg1gxyECohzDFoX7qHrzA", "_Eysff2hwHV6d6ps5jzoZw", "c1LO8FsRqyHLCVPP6fffaw", "F6ePXpZIIe7P0Se8b6hT3A", "gVAhZ67H_roH0TfMnq0eJA", "_YNwyNkrer_C4RvjPUneCA", "ej18xzDtmsvny03-amD_jQ", "X3h37GG6Za3qhVZiOnzIcw", "hdutE4CjdB4Vf65UJ6N5gg", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "lBd2PMaBPdpRbUQEh1hHSg", "5fwijdaFwmWNKzHJN7khZg", "3-cLDwytit_TrXQUgiYzmg", "ZfvSryawc1gCNTqPRrLOnw", "PWfAwKh-1Yc5b6S2t6Ksdg", "o_-X6jokjTOrOGY64TwwPQ"], "elite": ["2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.75, "fans": 27}}

I really didn't have a need for sweets OR coffee, I just wanted to experience a chill laid back vibe where i could get some work done and opted for this place.  As soon as I entered I was greeted/acknowledged which is BIG in my book. The vibe was cool. I ended up staying there for an hour or so because the wifi was actin up, but I did stay long enough to experience that sweet potato pie which was EVERYTHING!   I did have a bit of trouble locating a spot with access to an outlet, but since I was there for an hour it wasn't a big deal.  The only thing I didn't care for was whenever anybody ordered a panini...the smell/smoke from the sandwich filled up the room and by the time I walked out, I smelled like a panini and I hadn't even ordered one...not sure if this is because the space is so small or the ventilation system in place.  Overall, I would definitely visit this place again.

I loved that it was filled with so many books from black authors.  This along with the tshirts and othe nick nacks supporting black culture, I was truly happy I came.  I decided to try out the turk sausage breakfast sandwich.  It was premade in the refrigerated section but the staff heated it up for me in the panini press.  While quite warm and crunchy the flavor was ok but I suppose the food was just a side show compared to the cast book selection and coffee.  While there I had a great conversation with a few people about some of the books I was considering getting that day.

The first time was super pleasant, the staff were helpful, friendly and fun. The atmosphere was comfy cool. I stayed and chatted it up w a sister friend for a couple of hours. \n\nUnfortunately, my second experience was horrible and I didn't stay. I was told the person who had to do w this was the manager, and if this is indeed true... well, I think he needs management 101 and I give him a 1 . You want to accommodate your customers, make them feel welcomed, and know when to stay out of the way. There was a tall caucasian man blonde hair glasses behind the counter who was not very pleasant to me from the moment I walked in the door. Then proceeded to, as I spoke some words to a friend make an announcement load enough for the entire shop to hear that if I had an issue w him I could say it to him to his face not behind his back. Then go on to say \"cause I hv ears I can hear\". \n\nNeedless to say I took the most wonderful vanilla chai tea I've ever had, my croissant that I didn't hv a chance to touch, packed up my things and left.

They also have tables where you can sit and chat with friends and family. \n\nSo far I visted Uncle Bobbie's twice, the first time I came to meet up with a friend and the second was with my aunt.The first time I visted and ordered a latte. I didn't even know if I liked a latte, but since I was vibing in the book store, I figured why not soak up the moment. My latte was delicious and from the beautiful heart crafted in the drink, tells me it was made with love!

I'm so glad I drove from the burbs to see for myself. I enjoyed everything about this place. When I walk in boom the book I came to purchase. Much to my delight it was a remaining signed copy from an event with the author a few days before. Yay!!\n\nThe ambiance is nouveau nerd and I love it. Plenty of books for children and adults. If they don't have it they will order it. The staff is friendly and helpful. The owner and my BLACK MAN HERO was here. Boy if I were 20 years younger! Well enough about me. \n\nI'm a little cautious when it comes to pre wrapped or prepared food but I went in after reading the reviews. Well I had just about the best chicken flatbread panini EVER! It was filled with chicken, greens, cheese, flavor and it was grilled to perfection. The cook/cashier/inventory clerk did a great job making the sandwich as well as answering questions about the books and stock. \n\nAt times it became crowded but that's a good thing. The staff navigated well through it all. There is also very nice cashier who was bubbly and helpful.\n\nYou will love the seating options as they are laid back, very casual but clean. The problem? Time to expand which is a good thing!", "date": "2018-03-12 22:36:07", "useful": 7, "funny": 4, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "WzhoLpHMXI59ETuQ2sRVeQ", "name": "Leah", "review_count": 638, "yelping_since": "2011-09-25 03:13:03", "friends": ["_T6f-15h98uPxkDiVGUD4w", "5cBfwjuOT9HV2539Rucz5Q", "InInjzaZxzQ8_suxZEAP5g", "FyaR35w2tjG-og1JA9wexA", "aBA76hKuLWuNVTS-is7fGw", "hdutE4CjdB4Vf65UJ6N5gg", "4DF4YwO1LKWl5nhxgHkneQ", "1rCtEc1hzFF4m5zJ4wngHg", "_eD0kM-zZ_xYGj6NL8N_EQ", "aYveEctPYcZiubXyEgLhTA", "_u2A-8CdpnlXVSb5SCXOBQ", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "BxN1P9y4x359Hkm83DyZZA", "Xu7itIAz90gMsN33mzbO9A", "TYCkjEHPSJSnFb6m6GDluw", "JW5W4OZCohTvZlRF1jzrTg", "-QXLsyAvrIqcjvxtDxxSfw", "OeMDHEXQcsq0ZGhk9Ta7qg", "crrSJiZjMvSLdayvmwyKsg", "JCrxtP9Hb2v3egtYAxgdeA", "b8aCjlTJDA0hoZLMAE-iLg", "Lev9fZK-OU_R9XFQA-93ew", "JQvMNDFsvT_njvRgWUir3A", "MuKK7Kiv_zUZ0EdHjH9ypQ", "VUKoeNObTjuNQYJG7HUAzA", "TblUttf3s3eMBeW9KTCsNw", "r9S0VYrdXJrdhfR7OXj8tA", "cvgb6avLWd7VIaEK_v1gKQ", "R_g7nh8iT_qVUkjtb10gdA", "9aPhTC34PILldShZHzPi5g", "-xotbvscTK8t19mittfplg", "t4k3EWfRrcEGpknAwJ59Vw", "cJOfGg5ChvP7NC3_1sgCdw", "_iHbovM6oCm3fTu8ZqTx5Q", "eXych7LFgg5uI6VaRAUW2w", "-YAXThScggsREXhutAHkAA", "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "1czfDyA7_qX02ObsdA5O6g", "_tDsHb122SE9PUaTXzgrag", "YhTQFj8dZOl_APgWAQ4VGQ", "fb9eDPNW21CSbYyOfnnwIQ", "YvZG-SGe5Y73xD5FVEVoCg", "cNJH72DSOEjLHNNNK05lEQ", "m0yOS2VDeP6PQ-JNm-K_kA", "TMvw_P9T36Jqm3Q8pxlwEQ", "_sZ6KsJyDRvaTBRZY9Welg", "pHAXWbzL3Zubw75DKXM2ZQ", "DkCAJmuIUF3N-6MxPZErvw", "p4ubt9o_zQBzy3xK6aOkbw", "Ch759-9JBBu-UafQ2-abYQ", "K17847uudqPFPIjSPgxs2A", "4DkhJhJMchEan4stdmah8w", "gKvq4rRXmcNitiw63d6CFA", "dyAaNxc4QGNxOIYz5uSy4g", "VVs0OoDD7ikOS5Qtme6YQQ", "nLubA27Qo3EgTnIEOgVvbQ", "Gu_i42c5nD8uSYxIJeFNOA", "rcTGi-Bw5YHlGaB9x-dO7A", "zg6lm7DLKJArzFxLDILhwQ", "erBDslOZXDI48j5QB_I_SA", "I7TglGBOKEQtralwIAgzvQ", "XuhpPK0bZgVenkGBh7KA6w", "5zbOaHWqMOhy0G4kEg9wKg", "GjhV51ooyTM9GKY9mwuqoQ", "CAElBD0ReYRnSIItIoMhKQ", "OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g", "8bZ9QiMWMpAka36qHh2OSg", "0YyF7OrD2VEUVUiYmKZ8MA", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "Ase_kJIYuT6yOsqqVPuWUA", "aDhZb3CPuYdjMCzLqWGU2Q", "OIl_ZSc0rDE8iphiAjS-xQ", "GfI-d9mQePFA2PvhAd4WGQ", "469clQ5HKTtp8iu7ugsc2g", "SaYctOj-v2LNNkD4EXtZUA", "OmL2bjLvvRxg1brM5Pehgw", "_uXsvqMJYALJLaP0DaCWsw", "pWhaWrBMYyykptjvCO_60A", "aIbYxOV_3dBIPUcnl806xg", "vU9_lZqJQIR8btUYw7fqxA", "h0TX3pcrn-0gyBWEkBj9rg", "cCeCQxErE9ToaQQBEVFuFA", "Vg0-Hj1sk92UhPBcoFqalw", "dYJPAlkQx_K7WVfbg3aj7A", "KMZDZqP__XpDKM_pqq6eYQ", "U4dBJgRR_oWYl8b2WSsvHA", "BUE3Dwp0VRWpgIyjm_kIKg", "tUW0AXg4C3H9TP5lyhoQuA", "L_VtS7bG90Eml8DcqyBICA", "eJnwyot0rLyWN84DwyC0RA", "acshnsJsMZS9iIx30bSuUQ", "2-emzYMEFFSOcEBF6B-0NQ", "PSnUXFT5luMvb73mQQSjUg", "QczCdRxNPg08FGbrj9n0VA", "E5arVQm9E3KCkW_eZkhnBQ", "Um1L7twS4en-CHduiZwivg", "DN0MGxAPkf9PLoogszhYwg", "6pbNMgTnSYrtPHDN07IXwA", "YqjW3aqnM2fUyyDHYnuiiQ", "dFsZHNkZAhCsN_A7g8BJAQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "VRkv17cgz3qDw_6XbqwyIg", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "rvYTWj_twMGMkT3k7qjxZQ", "TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g", "q0tbrlAMpZkvT2JdkgyRrQ", "pmvf-Zl1WFRjf3yNXejYCw", "6kJFLAHV-tNsBEZaRTqEWQ", "K74S1UK7QjAhWnkXIN0nhg", "a5XLXFORBwdNmvbtd7j_FA", "P1n1WG61-QM7gvnWJLc3fg", "OdyWh9-9Y6Boc3L2FGnRqg", "cDQG_OGCpu4ATDz6rQSryw", "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "1lad9hCBGpHAS2uMSrKCPw", "1GH6Hnh6jLfCT951zmcUYw", "oFmZ2gzTPCw276AlBnxVwA", "IzbOz9Dt-Xu1jfu-fa9x2A", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "DsHkwKjrwl-RUxTvmFcO_w", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "OINYv6r1OMFK9wbDpno9AQ", "ob7vqzZSroN_cxR-xp3cKg", "OFKh72lDR-kXIfpVor7zUg", "U-JEYg6e72Scz_Syx3k9uQ", "-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw", "yxB2t8PijiCdr6wi0SKAtw", "Q8KyX6MHUrtjLodF1_ndOQ", "swF_o9MtCT1MPZvWFgRzYg", "0QNRU_A6aruI-SrZdG0OrQ", "HxyLRaoH9PS09M6R3rV-EQ"], "elite": ["2017", "2018", "2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.48, "fans": 66}}

The coffee lived up to its reputation; I like to drink it black and it went down smooth with no sour after taste. I wasn't planning to eat here initially but was really curious so I got an egg white and spinach sandwich on ciabatta bread. They get their sandwiches from Le Bus and I was pleasantly surprised by mine. They keep them in an open fridge with their drinks and stuff so I didn't think it would be much good but after having it toasted it was pretty good. The egg white was a little tough due to it being toasted but with the tomato and cheese it came together well and I ended up downing the sandwich. \n\nFood aside, I love the ambiance. Nice R&B music as well as many bookshelves all around stacked with books. Their chairs are also super comfy and there is plenty of space. I liked their leathery high chairs at their bar tables by the window. Great place to do work and get some time alone. Service was also good, staff were super friendly. Lastly, the price was right. Black coffee ranges from 1.5-2.5 dollars and the sandwich was 5.5. Definitely recommend this place.", "date": "2018-03-14 22:16:38", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "kj-jdhOYqi85101EEu1kTg", "name": "Melissa", "review_count": 18,

Since Cosi closed on 2nd street we didn't have a nearby coffee house and I ended up going to Philly Java which is pretty good but the music is too loud and interferes with those of us who like to listen to our own but I digress. \nBodhi is a cool space, small and intimate.  The servers are very nice and friendly.  But there are some serious flaws here.  First, the seating sucks.  The high stools are unstable and the table space is very limited.  The wooden chairs wobble and being able to balance a hot cup of coffee with a book or laptop is nearly impossible.  So much for the ambiance.\n\nMy biggest criticism is their coffee.  The house brews are from Stumphouse but they are super strongly brewed to the point of truly distasteful bitterness.  I love strong coffee and drink it black with no sugar but the Bodhi brews are just too strong.  The iced coffee is also really bad.  I also drink it black with some simple syrup in it to give it a bit of sweetness.  I tried it once and after near $ 4 with a tip walked a block and a half away tasted it twice and tossed it out. I was so hopefully we would have a cool place to drink coffee in the neighbor but I have been really disappointed at Bodhi.", "date": "2010-07-14 16:00:41", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "tlbPmw0TtzODN7CfaZeC9g", "name": "Joe", "review_count": 126, "yelping_since": "2010-06-28 14:36:53", "friends": ["g1N0f1N5aSp09u0dKr7xYQ", "7tCL10cCP1EzOXyILgnMvA", "v7aCBDsziCz3sIO0ap7fcQ", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "4_IJKLhoyof73pvRal4Exw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.46, "fans": 2}}

I still don't know where at the counter I should be ordering - a friendly \"order here\" sign would be a nice addition. On my last visit, the steamed milk for my latte was short (like a 1/4 cup short). The server asked me if I cared (albeit very nicely), instead of apologizing and immediately making more. I said no, because I wanted to be gracious - but is the customer supposed to be the gracious one? In any case, she still charged me full price. I was surprised. I would have defaulted to charging for the next smallest size, especially if I hadn't immediately offered to steam more milk. \n\nThe prices are a bit steep - I only got a few coins in change back from my $5 for the stunted latte - which is the only reason I would not make Bodhi a regular coffee stop. \n\nI haven't tried any of the food yet, but there is a small menu of bagels, sandwiches, etc. available. \n\nIn any case, assuming a little smoothing around the edges, I think Bodhi is a welcome addition to Headhouse Square.", "date": "2010-05-16 13:25:40", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "h8639WiBT3VO7ZdPxCyf0g", "name": "Lauren", "review_count": 115, "yelping_since": "2009-10-22 17:07:52", "friends": ["ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "EdHLoZf007yayX0FKqtA3w", "PwsVOVx-wZ3J3a70zZoVyg", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "CgpsYx1dwOp-YuZ9yavKYg", "z18cCYKAdDGtZtYdGNEP1w", "fdtIkTfbi0UvvgsSGm98dA", "s_ushMFjAYjIvszJW2gOhQ", "RgDVC3ZUBqpEe6Y1kPhIpw", "kdIdmAH6VGqY6fOPgJhHZQ", "xmXdWjNXdweV5uJWMxOZ3A", "sGt1R_nmq_Ne-FgOsIQCvQ", "0MJ5sKX5uq7Ma5hbl4l3BQ", "C2VEhrV4vrjC_9I0oKLZcw", "2LfozZiejXfQHcS52-Fv5w", "cEDMie5DjE_00sJ23H2q9Q", "NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A", "gdfgfnEHdDJmiUnfDn4dyA", "TIDInpZw-LSNLr1-BUnqsQ", "qsG5uwILmSIuKXaCljEe1w", "dhq3TTUJrbflZvWG0C7fzQ", "ALWSjow1qxW4SFFZ0ZNB6Q", "bFhrZ36wm6zm_dkjIpEDsg", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "mrj9Umhf3jJZ_jGN6Vfowg", "U4N6CLsoEF45ulcoc0X2ng", "DGfettgNWsiwdcv6KfXJQw", "XIs_A_6FBnrfJMAW6abIaA", "-veY2XiX4wYGh5foh3QZtg", "ivsGeVXV4c7F6Q4JXNt1ww", "IC5RpKZ0piHnOR23-KttiQ", "bVaSXSdn8_pwKaT52ghGEw", "3HTls6aaTT2_sXgoiS2UvA", "2OiyOHo7CQY05bFwY55HjA", "clkcLsjIHlB_M4E5lC3k3Q", "bnHCAZTk-btf9H4aZH21fQ", "zDJLk_afhZ-QecizBlq69Q", "QMG8oS_m8i76QbJNlnYM2Q", "zAefBXGlIab5hRAwRtgsvw", "8mzGCD1bIfdZqa_ZAP56qg"], "elite": ["2010"], "average_stars": 3.59, "fans": 16}}

Even the name makes me smile. Talk about sticking to the theme - EVERYTHING about this adorable shop is local...even down to the light fixtures. In the back there is a retail shelf with beautiful locally produced items of all sorts - from sauces and dry goods to chocolates and spices. The sandwich case boasts some beautiful sandwiches and sweet bars. AND Bodhi is one of the shops that carry Betty's Speakeasy cupcakes. \n           Don't like what their brew of the day is? No PROBLEM! Choose one of the many roasts they also sell in bulk and they'll brew you a cup on the spot. The baristas are friendly, accomodating, knowledgable; and judging by the way the place is populated every time I have been in or even peeked in the window, everyone has caught on. \n         So I know you're saying, \"But Gale - if you love it so much, why are you not going for the money shot of 5 stars?\" Well, I have a thing about coffee...I need - nay, DEMAND - a dark roast. I need an espresso roast or a deep dark French that slips down my throat like a muddy stream and leaves a full and nutty warmth in its' wake. I dislike any coffee that has notes of floral, citrus, sweetness, or is described as bright and uplifting...I need robust, chocolatey, full-bodied, bordering on char. Light roast? Save it. Medium blend? Go f*** yourself. If I'm forced to pay over $2 per cup when I go into a shop, I want to make the shop earn my approval with a flavor that wows. Being fully \"wowed\" is a rareity for me in a shop...more often than not I am only \"deeply satisfied\", and this comes more from the company I am keeping or the atmosphere that creates a rich experience. Bodhi is fantastic for all these reasons, but the coffee that I chose, which was described to me as dark, was, well, deeply satisfying. \n           I WILL be eating one of their breakfast sandwiches one day, as when I was here once with a friend the egg/cheese/muffin she was savoring nearly made me turn into the tazmanian devil. But I really value her presence in my life, so instead of blabbering jibberish and hurriedly snatching her sandwich off the plate and shoving it in my mouth, I just swalled my saliva as it formed. You CAN take me in public, I swear.\n          SO, to sum up: as a crescendo to a parade through the Headhouse Farmers' Market, Bodhi is the perfect stop.

And also so jealous I don't live closer to this gem! \n\nThis is a quintessential neighborhood coffee shop with a friendly barista, chatty regulars, great atmosphere, ample seating, AND free wi-fi! I came here to chill for a couple of hours, and ordered my usual latte. It was delicious, just as good as La Colombe and Menagerie IMO. Menagerie is my go-to closer to my apartment, but when I get tired of it, I'm going to walk all the way to Bodhi for a peaceful, chill afternoon. The friendly staff made it much better too. \n\nThey have a menu of specialty drinks that I'll try next time, including Honey Bee (espresso, honey, nutmeg, milk), Ipsento (espresso, honey, cayenne pepper, coconut milk + whole milk) and other inventive creations. \n\nOne star off because it's a little chilly and drafty indoors, so bring a cardigan.", "date": "2017-02-02 20:42:53", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "YwxjrOYe1X5bJxWtmiENQQ", "name": "Jia", "review_count": 151, "yelping_since": "2014-03-07 04:43:49", "friends": ["h-bGAN-_e9ANjTdjpBsmrQ", "rh7RAyVuesnMHnSg--5FhA", "RFy2kfY1ZAlF1KBI-ffbiw", "Y6pz15qKRrPhy5WVfuUtaw", "5XojyIgTdWO3OVyAGnCt6A", "9_pMcjlYBAKgEEKU2-oREg", "YYh8iYLYfgRGRs7cCNJJEg", "B2QtUS2OqswZoMjmlN9ANQ", "C3WnAxxy_B3JyaptYVFJTg", "-TceueVMaMiAD05c41z-OQ", "wPVByZWIsNybWolHcXi9Qg", "7aix3V4HX_YWjOvpplCwLg", "ccFd-E1lQL-oN9WBcO8akQ", "Pc2ne6_sklXVi6Nx8yE_qQ", "A8pNhmLnRMabe86cxdgz4w", "YQp_iCizYON2zBou8_5e0g", "EeFdcSQUkjd14A3NgCanRw", "nCZzlxzAjwiM0LKvv-9--w", "m75k1KSqtonMXe_yX1Ookg", "a4b1k9Q24D7ZfDgSb7uKAA", "L1I38NgScM12I4ijI1KqyQ", "IHpCRR1QLy8G0AhODZJjYw", "Q1oMmm7tKPOzA7_gqcV4zg", "dIDGjxLsJDDWuYmv9WD8lA", "DiZ_GbppKO8fKqtXwXn4QQ", "QO_0kcyBCYSzhIZnmdUeCw", "yEBzLUXeYsTTCw8vezUfbQ", "UvXxIFG4FWsRbBDuGA6xnA", "1XbGhjVx1fTXNtwOS8W1Sw", "1VTzLMOH9FMDxlQmAlZCBA", "bf9HtY3WQ3ArPkVSg3m6tg", "xAfoPt1r-90_2QDgtDuX6Q", "9Pgpxk6jcHIszcKhRZF3AQ", "4rVQR_N21ihXcUR1awcLJg", "wi69j3UNXFHKVKYYaZ5v8Q", "ZpWGDhBPdV2SqxNxRI1M3w", "6UosYYm8Uk4sqWTM99QWjQ", "Yt9hSCjyDZzeCw4DpRKoHA", "rRmKDhBlFX4pCvsqw8Coag", "LS47vxRfwG-L_OJFwwW1Fg", "f4YIbqFSLhMgC74BbGwacg", "lHQw-4zOhxfF-1s27goT4w", "qZK0osiEvmbOG32ul5n0Qg", "EbE6-2lsgYFJMoDyZs_Uaw", "jy-3q6Iy7103_L7l4YmLzg", "UqqxHhG36GAYhnphk9ZP5A", "5krcHYuVHUAcFlGQybYcIw", "iz3xw__B6Qgy2rjtPE8Gwg", "_YsSt6f0TRp3S8gamTRSUg", "hsWuqCPIc3mDCKheukbABw", "nzIq7_i0C79ToOp-U5e0fA", "7LM7HZGFSMp-hWt70ih4dw", "HfpedB0VAuAbiMQNkhHvlA", "8IhKOLC9txhZmV7T2nabnw", "_ZLLeeuLTpHKeU34HTZdIw", "hL-nxQkgDJ_KsbyafpcK5A", "cAvtTlh2gv5vJE6XtbHALg", "SVuUwbjHj6M1fT9zhSnTTw", "5UPT4GiWesQ9wp16XPRueQ", "Ix_LKsk3XVl7bZlJl495zQ", "2jTqpqHAQnIzIfwHdaOiqQ", "mA6NjdvIrO9wPmAEPVh17Q", "ioj6M77hJ0AeVbp_S-jKow", "Q1KsimGjBjdRZP7sq9XnAA", "l_A8UPRsWkvGZlBlE9EUzQ", "M7DkTvczdE4l2tT2zBVwkA", "5zOxJs6aMyDGqnn1HmXgSg", "O2JC15sJwWgbER6Ia-8DNg", "c7fYtWfVe2POwM-6kVgD7g", "uksX66FB2v5kSybQCAFqaw", "-5QV7-gPprIPcRTqA3p_8Q", "PfOWs3_apoGiSOzq-0zGxA", "rUomRm_odRNvUpd4Y6tDdQ", "T8viwDfVWVsPCXcJ99Ngww", "Ws6mtcqnAUaN8Lb0Owiafw", "F4ut-ZOHmJQchnvJzTnYkw", "6w6crUlGfzP7OXWuQ8zqhQ", "dRAnpNXN26LBKnJxRwxHzA", "Rv4om6q9uXsD4vsBm3cItw", "zDX5MJHh1CmyP8tYAI0Tlg", "tCy7eLoZ4VTceoJKD6Mitw", "7zDNtr7VX-yhLRgngY7_nQ", "fNNzM88wVZwGKLsDgqjyBw", "co76qOLbbjeG2A9LZymtjQ", "TrrjSs_RLjBr8xzeX2OCpw", "HShX9Mb8nz5S89Dpt0ds0g", "NeS1LF0mVkRF2bJzvcO5KA", "UXGMzkyj5Syf_pgAfhYFlw", "h4veGeTAwPrBcwTJKVlp4g", "Ldr-tPeFK7hFBAzc2HzIBA", "8PvJysXFh3Cjv_qXk_VZ0g", "h5HZmU5AvtapGx5ZvyGA8w", "eQzljL5FzrZiR_jKppeuqw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "xTw77DZVPJZxJHBM0s9_Ww", "s8r0nqIg4sOpvQ5qksgGlA", "UhOgw2UeEdcp75A_Lo61-g", "_cA4P1mBYZByGnIetoGNNQ", "vqpKcbffsCZW9CwYg_4CrA", "6knga-vNLcCxdQmhevWjTA", "X9LT66H7NosO9MOSm_qt8A", "qLAyNVsVrYA2_RWyRVdQHA", "vEnNGc04hqeGgzk4R9inmg", "Hw_EfoSU7cpHWYFitMhC7Q", "Xya2Zc1WtP8Tkh3cAmEylA", "I8PdqAioWBAbgNENuFuUHA", "I6wsN9GVDEvNUKJbVE9PFg", "iW-HRagCFpGezPVd3Fd5dA", "p_aMB3bJfr5OFfA3TBXc5g", "CxcAAIvR_6XtwZ1IRx_mBw", "BrwL82p5piBtJMuJqZZz_Q", "d3M1kM9VdR_j_andVjNIDQ", "R1XyvMEB-ph6itrjaUrfjw", "YW3dBTmsddCDtjgoBT-XJQ", "xtrJSP8oF6Ez1sVrKAHB6w", "kkPmwboW5Fe5a0ZrqTvCHg", "6seWUZwqNXDRfgA7N8Z8Zw", "jZDgwHzWepe_DvPHCFdc6Q", "_pE9wtP4DhTxlPw_fbwrlQ", "QGi2DEmxG2l_ZANa5ENBKQ", "K4ZeG8WAPfTS1AjD5GoJTw", "PQRUghWteWq4zfhpI2c7zQ", "WmVraxGrZx3ap8cQyqXKQQ", "3zCE3BQKPz8hxGvNrGGv-w", "4Iqr_HFb0hX9WzbGPntLbg", "gl4q1F7bH2EDLd2PCdw88w", "dVagDM442x0qqxWNUs0aLQ", "C0LCwB8f1FjSni-C-b_tTA", "C2fatddUmQlZA9WP8qTd2A", "7D7zq_LkD1YfgZhJPP6zBg", "c4UjNLDWwiQ3G9mqIkPr8w", "N7DMlNaVWInj8qN3Jdj8Og", "cAAHl3HXtPcPiqhkr_Jevg", "QWm0Uyurm-7ufwCEWYGWxw", "tXhPkQ6qkInKbhSYiwLvRg", "e-kFl3RHyqynyhwYgp4D1Q"], "elite": ["2016", "2017"], "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 4}}

Needless to say, I needed some coffee the morning after the wedding! I looked up coffee shops near my hotel before I arrived since I don't mess around when it comes to my morning brew. I decided on Bodhi and am so glad I did. I got there before the morning rush and was able to watch the market set up, grab a seat, read the paper, and enjoy a delicious hand poured brew made with Stumptown beans. Few things are better than pour over coffee and Bodhi knows how not to mess with a sure thing. My friendly server helped me pick a bean variety and looked chic in her selvage jeans while doing it. I also had a yummy organic, grass-fed cow yogurt from NY.

After a lunch of champions at Federal Donuts (fried chicken and donut sandwich), a good friend and I rolled on over to Bodhi to wash our lunch down with a pour over coffee.  My partner in crime who was with me is much more of a coffee geek than I, and told me that the \"pour over\" method must be tried.  Our barista, Gannett(?), served us each a pour over, and explained that the beans that are used are from Stumptown Roasters out of the Pacific Northwest.  Wow.  The beans I had chosen were Guatemalan, and the coffee came out perfect containing an immense amount of depth without having that strong, overly roasted flavor.  This was not a dark roast bean, so the milder subtler flavors were much more distinguishable.  Great freaking cup of coffee.  For those that aren't aware, like me, the pour over method is when the barista hand pours hot water out of a special type of kettle with a steady even stream over the ground beans that sit on a filter where the coffee, then drips into a vessel below.  It takes a steady hand, and obviously practiced skill.  \n\nUnfortunately, we did not have a lot of time to kill in Bodhi as both of us had to get back to work, but I will definitely return soon.  This is a place that really takes coffee seriously with a major respect invested from where the beans are sourced all the way through every step to the final product in your mug.  I don't think you have to be an uber coffee nerd to appreciate the final product, because in the end it's a damn fine cup of joe.  I can't attest to the quality of the food or other products in Bodhi, but I can only assume that they put as much thought into those as well.

A very similar experience, this time we stood there at the register but the employees more or less ignored us.  I really don't know how to explain it, they seemed allergic to the customers.  \n\nThis last time, I only wanted macarons.  With Audabon closing, I didn't have a lot of options nearby.

Half the time, the employees were both in the back.  After waiting for a while, I ask for macarons and we head over there.  I started stating which ones I would like, having had a long time to look at the menu.  But now there are other people waiting there, and despite waiting by the macarons first, then waiting in the other line, I was rudely told \"there are other people here before me\".  I'm not sure if this is an extreme lack of customer awareness on behalf of the employees or a fault of a poorly designed location (two counters, with two employees, that go here or there whenever they please).  Thankfully the additional waiting time gave me the time to look up alternatives.  \n\nFor macarons, I recommend the nearby Metropolitan Bakery or the Sweet Endings at 13th and Walnut (which apparently carry Audabon macarons).  For coffee, there is Joe or Elixer nearby.  There is absolutely no reason to waste your time here.\n\nTo be frank, I cannot comment on the food or drink as I have never actually been able to eat or drink here.

Two days later the guest list increased so I increased my order, received a receipt via fax, and was charged on my credit card.

The manager at the Philadelphia location claimed that their main bakery only sent my original order and they had no other cakes to substitute for my missing pieces. With the event in less than an hour away, I finally got a hold of the owner who basically told me that his employee already undercharged me so I pretty much got what I paid for.

He got my macaroons and I got home and they were crushed... I don't even know how that happened? I took great caution taking it home. And I got home to check on it, sadly a few of the macaroons were crushed. So I had to get a different gift and waste more time. Secondly, I used a credit card to purchase my macaroons. All I got to do was hand the card over and sign. As soon as I finished signing the cashier snatched the receipt from me and didn't even thank me. I didn't get a chance to write the total down though, but I was fine with that, the shop was busy. As I look at my statement a few days later after that transaction cleared,  I realized that the cashier decided to give himself a little tip at my expense. I called the shop and the manager apologized and said that it must have been a mistake. Asked if I had a receipt and he would refund me. I said yes ( I kept the receipt bc I knew this was going to happen with how the employees treated me while I was there ). The manager said great, I will call you back later today. No phone call was ever returned. I called a few times and even stopped by the shop, he is unreachable.

I remember well the excitement at the opening of a genuine patisserie in Philly, for the city clearly needed it. Back then, when a fork sliced through the Miel Gateau, the onlooker would be tantalized by the deftness with which layers of chocolate sponge moistened with rum had been arranged around a creamy chocolate mousse surrounding a vanilla Bavarian center!  Bennett was a genius with chocolate (The Temptation Trio, and his artisan chocolates were testament to that), and could also create artistic blown sugar pieces. \n\nOnce he left, and Miel was sold off to investors, the decline in quality became evident whenever I visited Philly and stopped by Miel. Gone was the delight of the banana centred gateaux bebe, and the millefeuille was no longer the creation it used to be. Frankly, the cakes at Cheesecake Factory in Philly surpassed those at Miel in quality! \n\nSlowly and gradually, I stopped frequenting Miel, till I read somewhere that the group of investors had sold their stake back to the original owner (not Bennett) and so I thought of giving them another chance while attending my five year re-union recently. \n\nI started with the macarons, which while pretty to look at, were far too crispy and not chewy enough. They fell apart at each bite. But, other than the texture, even the taste did not impress for any of the macarons I tried. Also, other than the chocolate tart mentioned above, neither the opera cake, nor the chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee were worth the Center City rentals factored into the price.\n\nMiel has a reassuring familiarity, like the girl you once knew in college. And, while circumstances may have forced you two to part, it's best to concede that there's always a good reason why you two weren't able to keep in touch afterwards. Nostalgia may be a powerful emotion, but eventually, the past is a foreign country - they do things differently there.", "date": "2009-06-08 04:04:46", "useful": 11, "funny": 7, "cool": 11, "user":

Our hotel staff raved about the delicious pastries, hinted at the Le Bec Fin connection and urged us to go.  The exact words: \"They will blow your mind!\"\n\nWell, we went...but our minds remain intact.\n\nSERVICE: Service was slow, but once we got attention, the staff was patient in explaining the pastries.  It would have been very helpful to have prices and labels for the many pastries for decision making purposes.  The caf\u00e9 ran out of ice for our Miel Iced Tea ($2), but the staff managed to convince us that we were, in fact, better off without ice because our tea would not get watered down\n\nCROISSANT: We tried the Chocolate & Almond Croissant ($2.75), which was everything a sweet croissant should be.  Flakey and buttery with plenty of filling.  As a bonus, the croissant was enormous and easily shareable (unless you are a butter-holic...in which case, you should get your own).  Had we stuck to the croissants, this would have been a 4 star review\n\nPASTRIES: Unfortunately, we could not resist the adorable pastries and scooped up a key lime square and a small cheesecake.  The key lime square was passable although otherwise unremarkable.  The little dome of cheesecake was adorable, but the crust lacked any distinction and there was a strange layer of gelatin coating on top of the cheesecake.  We concluded that this addition was meant to create a nice shine and uniform texture on top of the cheesecake, but it really subtracted from the texture\n\nAnd now for the vilest transgression of all...\n\nThe MACARONS ($1.25 each) were incredibly stale.  After hearing the unusually low price, I opted to get one of each, but I should have known better.  These were practically inedible.  In fact, the chocolate was about the consistency of chewed gum and we threw it away after a single small nibble.  Robert Bennet must be incredibly disappointed in the low macaron standards of the new owners!  If you go, make sure to check if they were baked fresh that day!  Otherwise, skip the macarons and stick with the croissants!\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Rittenhouse Square is a great place to sit in the sunshine and enjoy your croissants.  There is ample bench seating and an endless parade of strutting puppies", "date": "2011-04-18 22:17:07", "useful": 5, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "Ss6Fz9oK7HCOvYllxpdwEw", "name":

First thing I asked when I walked in:  Do you to take Amex? Answer:  yes.  Ok great... moved over to take my order of macarons and a cake. Get to the checkout register (where I had initially asked the question about Amex)... and THE SAME GIRL points to a sticker on register and says... We don't take Amex.  Now this is like 10-15 mins later... you can't have that short of a memory, CAN YOU?  So now I'm totally annoyed bc I walked in around 11-11:05... meeting is 11:30 and it's now 11:15-11:20...leaving enough time to walk to Broad and Walnut, but that's about it.  I am like.. You just told me that I could use it... now you're saying NO.  That's ridiculous.  Other girl/manager comes striding over and glares at me and is like... what's the problem?  I explain... she goes into this whole \"Everyone needs to calm down... she's still training, BY THE WAY\".   So it's my fault that she lied to me.  Ok.  Got it.  Anyway, so they end up taking the card and such.  Manager is still mumbling under her breath about people needing to chill out... and I'm sitting there thinking to myself... your employee basically lied to me rather than ask you a simple question... so what are you annoyed at me about?  If she's training, that's fine... and it's ok to ask someone... but to lie, say it's ok, let me stand there while I select items and have it all packaged... and THEN refuse that payment... C'monnnn... if that's how their training works... I'll stick to going elsewhere.  Plenty of other client treats in the immediate area.", "date": "2016-04-23 14:08:41", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "9Vi70EutyHflE0yTOis44Q", "name": "Barbara",

The servers could use a bit of congeniality training. And they could stand to update the sidewalk board a soon as the soup they are advertising on it runs out. \n\nThe sidewalk board advertised chicken vegetable soup. I stopped in for a bowl of it and a roll for lunch. When someone at the counter finally took my order, I was told there was no more soup of the day. Darn! Just as I was about to leave, a server comes out of the back with a huge dish of soup to deliver to someone at a table. \n\nWTH?!?!?! Excuse me. Did you tell me there was an alternate soup when you told me the advertised soup was all gone? What kind of sales pitch is that? What kind of \"keeping business alive\" is that? Stupid little snotty nose brats. \n\nI had to ask. \"Is any more of THAT soup available?\" They were like \"...uh duh oh that one uh duh oh yeah that one is still available\" \"Well what kind is it? Can I get a cup or bowl? How much does it cost? Can you pack it to go? WTH kind of place is this? Do you want to sell stuff or what?\" \n\nFinally, I received and paid for a pint of too-sweet butternut squash soup and a roll. I was glad I checked my bag. They hadn't included a spoon. What? Do you have a plastic spoon? Kthanksbye. \n\nI returned to the conference slightly ticked and with my head spinning at the weird experience at Miel that left me feeling \"Meh, I've had better.\" I doubt I'll return to this place. Even though it was adorable from the outside and on the inside. I just can't tolerate that kind of idiocy in business.", "date": "2010-12-10 06:52:42", "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "TOj5yZZEwS3J3fLgo3V3yQ", "name": "Kelly",

Since I'm not much of a coffee drinker, and my love of all things sweet battles against my better judgment (and the thought of what my trainers would say), I hadn't tried their offerings until now. Passover provided the PERFECT excuse to pick up some macarons to enjoy, and dear lord to they have A LOT of different flavors to choose from! I took one look at the list that the sweet staffer handed me and I decided to make her life easier - and mine more difficult - by getting one of each.\n\nOverall, the macaron textures varied greatly - some had a great balance of crisp outer shell to soft, chewy interior, but some shells were way too hard (Cappuccino, Honey Chocolate):\nLemon Poppyseed: perfect, flavors and texture were spot-on, and such a pretty macaron!\nChocolate: classic chocolate macaron, nothing particularly of note but good nonetheless\nPistachio: pretty good too, nice chewy texture, robust pistachio flavor\nCoconut Chocolate: perfect, nice light chocolate flavor that didn't overpower the coconut\nEarl Grey Chocolate: had a kinda perfume-y taste, which was borderline unpleasant, but the texture was good\nCaramel Rose: I didn't get much of a caramel flavor for the caramel rose, the rose is just so prominent, but it is a lovely, non-perfume-y flavor, which can be the problem with rose water sometimes\nPomegranate Walnut: probably my favorite of the fruit flavors, it had a more subtle and crave-inducing flavor, not pucker sour like some of the other fruity macarons\nCappuccino: I LOVED the cappuccino's filling, and the texture was great too. One of my favorite classic macaron flavors\nRaspberry: tart, perfect raspberry flavor\nVanilla: sweet vanilla flavor, made my mouth water with each (ha! Like two) bite\nLemon Blueberry: not like Garces, I mostly tasted lemon and not much blueberry\nBlueberry: HERE was the blueberry flavor\nCherry Almond: I need to find/make/CONSUME cherry flavored things more often. Delicious bright cherry flavor\nSalted Caramel: this one was AH-mazing, but I am such a sucker for that particular flavor. Can't ever go wrong with salty-sweet flavors\n\nIn general, the fruit flavors were very robust and tasty, and overall had the best macaron textures of the bunch. I wish the macaron cookies had been chewier and not stale-hard for some of them. These seem to be hit or miss, but of course macarons are just ONE type of pastry that Miel offers - after Passover, I'll be back to try those beautiful mini pastries and cakes.", "date": "2013-04-02

Coming here can be a hit or miss depending on who's working there--some people are just more friendly than others.\n\nThe first time I came here was a year ago. I was feeling nostalgic after having the best macarons at Pierre Herm\u00e9 in Paris and was on a macaron craze. I  \"yelped\" for a location to get some macarons and Miel popped up. \n\nI have tried almost all of their macarons by now. I tend to buy a large batch to snack on for a week--haha, it never lasts that long. I asked the woman working there how long the macarons would be good for and she said approximately two days. I've noticed that they end up becoming too dry and brittle if left out for a long time (even if you refrigerate them), so you can tell if a batch is fresh or not depending on how easily the \"shell\" crumbles. \n\nAs I have only bought the macarons here, I can not really judge this caf\u00e9 on anything else. Every time I've come though, service has been quite slow. There's either a line or it's empty. Additionally, they have a menu for you to pick out the macarons you want from, but there is always more choices on the menu than there are actually available. Last time I went to buy rose macarons and they weren't available...They ask you how many macarons you want and THEN you go to the macaron booth to get what's available, if I had known I wouldn't have paid before hand. (So make sure you ask what macarons are available). It's a little bit inconvenient because they have them laying out without name tags so you can't really judge what macarons are what flavors the macarons actually are. \n\nRecommend: rose, blueberry, and raspberry. (They have a pumpkin flavored one right now for the fall!) \n\nTip: Trader Joe's sells macarons for a much more reduced priced and they are quite delicious! You can get 12 for around $6, while here the macarons are approximately $2.00 here--more than 3x that price. Therefore, my trips to Miel to buy macarons are more of a treat to myself for their specific flavors that Trader Joe's doesn't have.", "date": "2016-10-28 04:20:43", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool":

This was back in the day when downtown Philly didn't have so many sugary options to offer. Because of the abundance of options we have now, it had been years since my return.\n\nWell, I went back recently and was happy to see that they are still baking and serving delightfully delicious things. \n\nOn this particular trip, we had an entire plate of macarons (which my annoying and slightly douchey friend told me was pronounced \"like MACARONI, without the 'i.'\"  *insert eyeroll* \n\nAnyway, I didn't even think I like macarons, but Miel changed my mind with their rendition, and since then I have been craving one of these pretty little pastries every single day. Especially delicious are the lemon poppyseed and the salt caramel flavors. When you are selecting the flavors you want, make sure you get 2 of those. Trust me, you will regret it if you don't. \n\nThe coffee was also delicious and deserves an honorable mention. \n\nI was MOST excited about the pistachio. I saved the lucious looking green macaron for last ..... but when I took that first, what was supposed to be GLORIOUS bite, I found out that it was MINT! BLEH. And this is why this review lost some stars. Because that was a crushing blow. That, and the fact that their staff really is a bit on the atrocious side.... but mostly that. \n\nAnyway, if you want macarons, get them from miel. They were a million times (no exaggeration) better than Garces Trading company, and that's hard for me to say cuz I'm a total Garces fangirl. \n\nAs for the other desserts, I did find that some of their pastries have a tendency to be dry or stale tasting. I do think that is based on volume/lack of turnover. I'd suggest going on a  Saturday morning, which I would ASSUME would offer some of the freshest selections. \n\nMACARONS!", "date": "2011-09-09 20:12:28", "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "jwmMWvA_yTjXbzK0ErnEOA", "name": "Mindy", "review_count": 69, "yelping_since": "2010-06-15 15:53:54", "friends": ["-ZP9qiFYWLtHjuLyn1BjJw", "LGIzxrAH8TYBqtBiy-8IQQ", "b2Ct9t-cRDfquuHSGCJHYQ", "3SRc-dUYisXRXqGS9PtEnA", "6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ", "g-Z3XAKJ2HY4CpkfTZX_Gw", "VciG4cP9hKJSu9wHELMnHQ", "jpY8IGiem6A7kXfPrFv0PA", "mWamaq-Awy6tf7U4bCtT1A", "HwCWwx4PXIYJIksZN4MJZQ", "YAJswo-twIgeKX0mdW2r3A", "E1jzdK9MxYEsSlvON6VW4Q", "oSxn-sAg2_dA-MZIPdcg2A", "pw21atkeOy5CUtp8z5RCPQ", "8wEIhwyclf2z9_IzhVubKg", "vP_0RRLol_aYheZ1BTKI2Q", "UOMSN12IGpju4sKwIJQE_Q", "jKE2iIB0390PeKrH9z27-Q", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "DoINRSXLGdZLYEKxs0gOPA", "38Zm9pCc3ud4Bdw4DWoMhw", "muy58dpU4o0JKwucvPeGpQ", "pb4XKRpxfF70-LGtFizQTw", "RPWH_bNQGKj1ixAOe_jcdA", "84x5IPUdKUEItSKVdvDCZg", "uxb-PY0OmR0TG4n8EZHFaA", "PQCOGYxFcTXmhKMxwi6cGw", "Jxo1vOk_tf8DelsXyQbbFw", "AASvv8zn_hkSucsa4uQQqw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "MD6NN2GCVYloDCC3jDabOA", "hk92lrT9bYyrJ7_PRLaDGA", "ign-wXfFvXhgqYVTbxV3aA", "dAWHUjqu8iKTFiaujDbJUQ", "CWwO805i07EpA1CPEhaHBQ", "5G2IF0VIN3Brl-m45QDXsA", "1lDD944Akm-u69S_tAw1qg", "HxynKFSWRn_VkzRjZ_q91w", "yYBTAecMSd6vyr6F8EpiOQ", "cntN1wM3P4LsL74E_ESrBw", "K3GS3A_HTIobHsQYjPuwvw", "Xt5WnQcGYYp8sUKuIMuqaA", "UiRx8jyS6H957ItwFsP2nQ", "R95jUAYcnhesh9L5kCSeSA", "f-QXnHjEX-txhBHnTxJiuw", "4Brm9VijiQR-QXsEiurXOw", "W1eHcjd6kwKAzeFwDoOuJg", "TSpDFBMFx5ug2mvA5lHrPg", "A6eoW_tnXMc1fQoWSlnccA", "75EQgWMmx8iEft31IWKhOQ", "PQDgwcrvys-qBmDCgSebxw", "NbA3EesOf97adqUNfK8JWQ", "FqkgJ8j55H4Y48xn1dFoWA", "0MJ5sKX5uq7Ma5hbl4l3BQ", "-6YwvXaLvsk8eyn0GzbM-Q", "EuvpcCAJoNB_Mt2JFoFqJw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "j7gM2jTyQu3EIXVDvZSQ8Q", "eJnwyot0rLyWN84DwyC0RA", "w8yoASmlp6RSaZkFD38M1Q", "Yb4cSFzlHvgwm6ZcWHUSvA", "p9PbELHJvkWXVxfOa-15xQ"], "elite": ["2011"], "average_stars": 3.83, "fans": 7}}

I have spent hundreds of dollars on macarons and cakes and love this place, but over the past 4-5 visits, I have found their staff to be uncorteous, if not even passive aggressive. When they serve the cake or take the credit card, they make very little eye contact, don't smile, when I leave them a tip, there is no thank you, no  t even a thank you for your purchase or have a good day. They make you feel like they are obliging you in a way. And that's 2 separate of their employees (a Caucasian guy who wears a hat and a girl who wears her hair up in a bun with at times a band around her head), with two  or three others employees being very nice.\n\n My boyfriend noted the same thing several times. \n\nAbout us: we are professionals (a physician and an IT professional) in our 30s and as a group likely constitute a good portion of their clientele. \n\nWe suggest that the management of Miel Patisserie either replaces several of their staff members or teaches them the common courtesy that is observed everywhere else. Truly, this is the only place in Philadelphia where staff experiences have been repetitively negative. \n\nAlso, in the season of FLU, please don't use your hands to take out a packet of tea and twist it and touch all over it and then put in my cup, without washing your hands and then touching everyone else's money and credit cards.", "date": "2016-12-06 17:29:10", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "smJ0eNWuAh7jwBfjFS5U-w", "name": "Isabelle", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2016-12-06 17:28:59", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.33, "fans": 0}}

Ok, so technically when I purchased these pastries it was still Passover, but they were meant as a celebration once the sun set and Passover ended, so I think it was ok. They didn't have any names for the pastries, or descriptions, so I had to ask one of the staffers to name and briefly describe each one before I could make my selection. I ended up with a box filled with 3 minis and 3 'regular' sized pastries (they have minis of most of their pastries, and how could I refuse the chance to try more of their offerings?):\n\nSalty Tart mini - the large crystals of sea salt signal the name, but the chocolate ganache has such an intense, dark flavor, it overpowers the creamy caramel, and the light chocolate tart shell only adds to the overall chocolate flavor\nTiramisu mini - a perfect, French version of this Italian dessert, the square pastry is elegant and still incredibly tasty, MMMMmmm\nOpera mini - a very classic French pastry, with layers of rich ganache, smooth, creamy mousses, soft cake, if you love chocolate and espresso flavors together then this is your pastry\n\nNoisette - the crispy chocolate-hazelnut wafer base adds the perfect amount of crunch against the super soft, light, smooth milk chocolate-hazelnut mousse, and the thin layer of vanilla caramel on the top adds a light touch of sweetness against the bittersweet chocolate mousse\nMarjolaine - layers of hazelnut-almond meringue, chocolate ganache, vanilla bavarian, praline butter-cream, cr\u00e8me chocolate, chocolate-almond genoise, finished with a cocoa glaze - wow, lots of layers of flavors, but they all meld together into a delicious harmony of deliciousness and yeah, this was my second favorite of the bunch because of this harmonious cacophony of flavors, and it is seriously satisfying, eat one (if you can) and you are DONE\nMocha Tower - first, I don't think that was a devil's food cake bottom that I had - it was much better! I'm also sure that one of the mousses was hazelnut and the other milk chocolate, with the vanilla still on top, so I'm going to rename it the Chocolate Hazelnut \"Nutella\" Tower. Crispy, chocolate-y, hazelnut-y, the bottom layer added a much needed textural element to an otherwise incredibly creamy and super delicious mousse tower - dear god I'm so glad that I got the last one! Each individual mousse is perfectly creamy and smooth, and their flavor is spot-on, no mistaking what each one is.

Owned by La Colombe, but definitely with more of a messy, homey European feel.\n\n[ desserts ]\nAmazing selection: basic homestyle desserts like cookies and croissants; fine pastries such as chocolate cakes, tiramisu, coffee cakes, strawberry shortcake, carrot, and panna cotta; and a wide chocolate selection as well.\n\nPortioning is convenient: cakes come in tiny bite-sized pieces, slightly larger ones for sharing between two people, and large group-sized ones.\n\nThey also have sugar-free versions of their popular desserts!\n\nOnly complaint is that I wish they had signs and labels for prices and what each item is, so that you don't have to ask the servers about each individual item.\n\n[ macarons ]\nTowards the back of the shop is a large selection of small macarons. I think they are more nuanced in flavour and more well-made than Sugar Philly, which is the more well-known macaron source in Philadelphia.\n\nAll macarons that I ever eat get compared against the gold standard, Ladur\u00e9e in Paris. These are less fine and heavier in flavour and texture, but still quite good (7.5/10):\n\n-Green tea: strong and well-flavoured, small flecks of tea leaves in the cookie\n-Earl grey chocolate: sounded great in theory, but not so good in execution. Earl grey flavour just didn't marry well with the chocolate.\n-Fleur (d'oranger et rose): my personal favourite. Heavier and not as subtle as the Ladur\u00e9e version, but quite good nonetheless.\n\nQuality coffee and drink menu too.\n\n[ vibe ]\nDefinitely hints of Paris caf\u00e9 culture, without the snobbery. French music on an iPod dangling from a cable next to the milk and sugar stand, which was cute in a disheveled kind of way.\n\nServers wear cute black fedoras and are quite attentive and friendly.\n\nThere's about 6 tables inside, a bar facing the window (great for work or people-watching), and a table outside as well.\n\n[ conclusion ]\nWorth a stop for high-quality desserts at a great price in a nice European environment.", "date": "2015-04-25 01:37:21", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "tZhzLE92usoAGpNcFtzlQw", "name": "Casey", "review_count": 141, "yelping_since": "2011-06-03 01:34:57", "friends": ["hYIWSQrDuvp1dMFlpTCpyg", "n6UskNkDxwydTOHTOkwskg", "bX_uV_Hnml92Zhxzugg5WA", "9EiGbIyjxO0TKRsiBygy_g", "FXF6JgkSyOdTphk0YVUpuw", "3t_Jf5R5uRllg9ERHnsgRQ", "Pr-XlFMQYiladbB_YQxUYA", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "RKULSOrIvvYpDmtuYXEXzA", "Le9KD2nTc1VR8vGykR6qLg", "8BARDuw9utiKUj6Cfvfa0Q", "JhvJHEq8bUzscbcpAacHdA", "uqDGgPd8gRpFD0CmHvoeRw", "0LyHQfXVJ5WT334K-odKoQ", "I6ubnxeZNVKe9prIPf12hA", "SYgVIFxAe0XWlcY1PPq_Gw", "jO2sTHyVjGXk6Tbo7ltrxA", "pSm8h-Uewd3mRWwHctrshQ", "K6b_4ZVI6lgT2eL_ROg2Tg", "kxSkybkcUvSRctQ3qgEmVg", "rL4QUwRi2FvHG6JWkhsZiQ", "vN9rAl1ixlni4YbB8E-Rrw", "Xaa12Zr3gzCvT9-8UAljZQ", "liymdX-2oYY7jy4py09Vog", "LmMeCIZlHNRpyTduiFii4A", "NgCmkQawZhzyiwhm7k9Fiw", "tV1p7CDj6WfpwPM58gHjRw", "tBUAoNAxn-6ur367hitj8A", "lFZe42H_kNFwO1LNOlsiag", "OyttnyEOrtLZCooz5kqv6Q", "4GnSisYpsWQCSXEM0y5Q0A", "7P0MPsbBlWTWgkZ7csaQpw", "pF0PxJPJCzwqNWH7rWTiaw", "jTrNozKgNQMyn2gsEtLNbQ", "U5tJIHZvDjQhbCx98yqfkA", "QrlMJ8On0DI6WRbxww6VaQ", "dL-ujtfCE8tox83eQhmfMQ", "cndpW4OQV2tXy9Ek61u7hQ", "l7zmF8szWBC-A07oIDRdKw", "TNwbpJSkflp3HPCal_m2mA", "a6RhTQRs-qP7FDAXerDbTw", "FLMuHEuKYd3KyvTC_5MiVQ", "0HJ6sU0h_O3k8kRbYO3VXA", "ZkLcEbQbqXpuTjIsRFx-3Q", "upA7KHwfmcN9XpGIxw8K6w", "q10s3mM6fI4AP9pbf7PXGw", "XeeTMgXA44vdfuV-VGm95Q", "F1SyQ-c94wJvYS82F_HlOg", "-QmEKJ_CzZnT9biZHddfZQ", "E5Qqnw70zHOPRQqaINNYQw", "fAJ4v8WKt7DYkC2dskayvQ", "d6cEU9PUjY-GgpHmqUUWHw", "mV4lknblF-zOKSF8nlGqDA", "Fxh4_3Cvpy_HqQmjZP9jEQ", "ISBymj-pzq3AypWAo49LKQ", "isKK5Lr3xXUqb-8cZ-A7AQ", "OLIaLNpsQdyETXT6VcHK3A", "oqcEtAUU8nN2_GNcC_-rjg", "N3zqraAQwn7yR3u6qni4lA", "5Ax9vAx6NHiPXjUAjkRy_Q", "F8kRFv58lFM9_HJPF8FOBg", "CrM4OKc-tbVXldv1dU9lBw", "aHbFfSvYu9LyyfmcEnUSuA", "WSptrgW8NLFBNvw1FOpifw", "DSu-nDnhugQycmTpGSKnzQ", "-op9zxgn_c8xLskiJZwxlA", "aI2QKgNN6LmP4Gdt39QBfQ", "54qMDPYZtAmGkyKkOgd6AA", "3xrEz4XSTFJXIkOMfgeTtg", "yotLu26x-5S1IbSp2DIROA", "Ycyfx30Nce0WidRGkzmV-A", "hknE19CCWHbz_wvMRF5AxA", "xLPTijTjjPNeyocFWP8E1Q", "fvq56hMZvcePjf23LGdMMQ", "_3vUQxQ6hPyhx0GFEr-nHQ", "KBnWSNHd8HMDCmpkhFO2hA", "1oye79vxm5GqoILzzFHKPQ", "uolQACaXIrQVrvag3PnAKw", "zttHb-80gROKjJaW3JIVtg", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "N0un75Nz_OGmhcROiuj8VA", "skAWAZAOV5cCQRS3QaOa5A", "j6KgUdCQCdxLytN7Fvrxsw", "upnFPkNcmKnzOEz3ZHlpwg"], "elite": ["2015", "2016", "2018"], "average_stars": 4.01, "fans": 6}}

When it is a frigid winter's day and all you want is a hot crispy sandwich, this is a place to be. \nHidden near Rittenhouse square at 204 South 17th Street, this cozy caf\u00e9 was packed at 1pm and I barely managed to snag a seat near the window. It was also clearly a hit with the ladies, I mean I was the only guy there, I kid you not. Well, I in drag I could pass of as a girl too. \n\nIf it is your first time to the corner caf\u00e9 I absolutely must recommend the Le Miel sandwich ($7.95). This freshly prepared crispy pippin hot chicken fillet sandwich is served with delicious dripping melted brie and asparagus. Each crunchy bite is chocked full of tender flavor and sends me back to the chic sidewalks of the Champ Elysees. \n\nI also tried their Dijon sandwich ($6.75) and frankly I think after you have tried the best, the rest sort of trails behind. The combination of turkey, cheese and Dijon mustard was fine but then you get the sweet taste of the apricot jam mixed in with the savory and it just throws me off. Thankfully, a gulp of their freshly brewed ice tea solved that problem in a jiffy. \n\nNo meal at Miel Patisserie is complete without at least trying one of their many decadence pastries. Their chocolate cakes can be a little heavy at lunch and can put you into a food coma at that after lunch staff meeting (By the way, I think staff meetings after lunch should be outlawed in favor of an afternoon nap, productivity would soar.) I recommend the fruit tart, light, petite, and with just the right amount of custard sweetness, it is the perfect way to get your daily dose of vitamin C! \n\nDear Miel Patisserie, \n\nJe vous adore. \nXoxo\n\nMOAF\n\nOverall rating: 4/5", "date": "2011-12-09 21:33:39", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "GvhJXZECcG_CDr9EQIHMGA", "name": "Nicholas", "review_count": 4, "yelping_since": "2011-12-09 20:58:08", "friends": ["mnytYJHL-pErQ1GKZtwksw", "gahv47AYV2xNJI_hiHsK2A", "cczPrlM_2C3SeyVMQdnzsQ", "Gv0OY1DRWePXV5bY0nctyA", "sIE7JqGMTyJfUoowPJaYIw", "2H9KxGTXYzAp-UuGAHdXOA", "YhCFvJXEpl1MWm5gpAdctA", "b7TusO1FVOlDdVnOUyoHeg", "jQF9CqbIfpQit9B0MAG4Wg", "Sg_BvnTHsbc1AABiJjaiPA", "2-9cBl_De0S-h1LOjlAxjQ", "e5CBcg4OQ3kEwx5TjGTLJg", "W8eOY0NSE2eJc4JVZEWvAg", "enKawhFYQ-9Rhq_DdU97WQ", "DwkKZHhU8k7V1Wvc9zK4Fw", "ADUgPnvhSv385ZOzwWRV9A", "RHla_9AI45nGiRtfVyFf8g", "qVP0efbJrEz4b3RaBpMTXA", "xVgWPQ1VScz_blO_jjgVew", "MYS1nkW-Hu5uq_HAXwu1rw", "16oanotCg3p5wQ4e3XAK2w", "7T7tODEoO4KYL9xHUljuqA"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.75, "fans": 0}}

Hubs is a HUGE French macaron fan so I stop here on occasion when I want to surprise him with a sweet treat. These are hands down, his absolutely favorite macaroons. Not just in Philly, but from some of the high end, very well know places in NYC. (You guys know where I mean.) I've tried over a dozen spots and Miel still remains his favorite. Pistachio is his ultimate favorite flavor. \n\nThe place is lovely. Bright with big open windows for people watch. It has perfect, French feeling details. Don't miss the bumble bee wrought iron gates! Very cute. I dream about taking time to actually sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and chat when I'm here. It's pretty inviting. \n\nPros:\n-He loves them! \n-They have seasonal and ever changing flavors. (Most recently I purchased eggnog and Gingerbread for the holiday season). \n-All of their pastries are created with care and it surely shows!  \n-The space makes me happy and for a brief moment, transports me back to France. I'll take it! \n\nCons:\n-Parking nearby for a quick stop in stinks. Make this just one stop while running a few errands in town to stress you out less! No loading or quick open spots nearby. At all. \n-The staff is NEVER friendly! Ugh!!! \n-Most recently they started charging $2 for a box. This one really irks me! I rather spend that $2 on another dessert! These beauties are very delicate and can smash easily as everyone knows. They deserve proper presentation even when being purchased per piece! Boxes come complimentary for orders of 8 or more only! \n\nVerdict: I'll still ride around for parking, deal with employees who look annoyed and wait for the days they give complimentary boxes with purchase again...because he's worth it. Minor changes could make a trip here much more enjoyable for this wife who is just trying to do something special for her main squeeze.", "date": "2016-12-24 12:58:38", "useful": 14, "funny": 5,

I've tried several other places in philly but Miel has the best tasting, best flavors, best texture, and best price. I've never had macarons from France or even Laudaree or Bottega Louie but in Philadelphia at least, this is what I deem the best. \n\nIn terms of texture, most of Miel's macarons have a crispy outer shell and a chewy center, which is perfect for me (again I can't say I know what a good macaron is but I love it here)! I say most because my favorite Miel macaron, earl grey chocolate (see photo), is slightly harder than their perfectly mastered classic flavors. But let's be real, different flavors and ingredients bake differently so getting that perfect macaron can be extremely difficult. So maybe this flavor shouldn't exist? Let's not get carried away. The texture is alright but the flavor is amazing!!! Anyway, the other two I've tried this week were cafe au lait and pistachio and both were perfect (see photo). \n\nThey often have seasonal flavors but the classics are really the best so definitely get those if you don't want to be disappointed (not that the other flavors aren't good!) -- also another reason I don't really like the milk+sugar truck and audabon (besides the not-quite-right texture, flavors were not crazy at all but just a little experimental and I found that not to be something that makes a good macaron). \n\nCheck out the list of flavors for that day which is located on the far left above the macarons when you walk in. It usually goes something like: raspberry, lemon poppyseed, pistachio, blueberry, chocolate, salted caramel, rose, earl grey cocoate, cappuccino. \n\nI've tried some desserts a long time ago and all I can remember is that they were delicious! Their Miel tea/iced tea is also really good -- a mix of black, green, and jasmine I believe. I love the le parisien sandwich (and they all come with chips). Their service is okay, sometimes a little slow but sometimes it gets a bit crazy in there.", "date": "2015-03-08 18:39:21", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "re4iNqQzvdwSixYlGMgTsg", "name": "Jackie", "review_count": 10, "yelping_since": "2010-04-02 04:32:31", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.09, "fans": 0}}

It was like I found myself again. \n\nThe pastries are simply beautiful, both to the tastebuds and to the eyes. This place not only makes the prettiest pastries in town, but they also make them properly - not too sweet, while creating harmonious blends of complex flavors, colors, and texture. \n\nThe Marjolaine is like the 2nd movement of Berlioz's \"Symphonie Fantastique\" in pastry form. The Opera cake is not too far off. This is the only place I've been to in 15 years that gets the Napoleon right. Though not traditionally a French pastry, their version of Cheesecake is also out of this world. Not to mention the Noisette, which is chocolate-hazelnut mousse layered over a delicate, yet flavorful wafer base, topped with a delicious and beautiful caramel glaze. \n\nAnd of course, there's the macarons... which appear to be a subject of much contention among reviewers. I think as long as people try a variety of offerings here, they will be pretty happy. \n\nI believe the best macarons I've ever tasted were in Paris, where they were practically perfected to the molecular level. Outside of Paris, I've found pretty good ones in New York. In Philly, I've experienced hits and misses at pretty much every location that makes them, even among vendors that specialize in macarons. However, from my experience, Miel has mostly delivered hits - especially in the areas flavor variety and texture. Among those, the salted caramel and cafe au lait varieties are must-tries. \n\nBesides satisfying my pastry addiction here, I've also come in for breakfast, lunch, and post-traumatic-work-day afternoon tea, and I've consistently had excellent experiences. I highly recommend it.", "date": "2015-03-27 04:59:54", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA", "name": "Nataly", "review_count": 541, "yelping_since":

Every time she walked by, she had to stop by and buy something.  Or ten somethings.  And then leave it for us.  I, protesting her ridiculousness, refused to touch the pastries.  We're only two of us.  We don't even have any groceries yet.  I'm trying to lose weight (as always).  And you're bringing us a bag full of pastries?!  So I ate a yogurt instead and glared disdainfully at the pretty packages, while she recounted the stories the owners had told her about them.\n\nBut after my boyfriend's mom left, I couldn't help myself.  I took a bite out of the multicolored cake, thinking it must look way prettier than it tastes.  But it was amazing.  My left hand had to force the fork out of my right so I would stop digging in.  The next day I tried a couple bites from the muffins.  They were tasty, but it's hard to do anything really special with muffins.  That night I tried two of her most recent purchases, one of which was supposed to be some recipe saved from someone's grandmother who died in the Holocaust.  And it's a good thing it was saved, because that cake, and the one that accompanied it, were some of the most delicious confections I've had.

I wasn't able to stop by until 5:40pm after work. As I predicted, the delicious chocolate croissants were sold out by now. But, a few almond croissants were left, as well as a lot of muffins, cookies, and madeleines. AND they were all 50% off (I'm not sure what time this sale begins every day). I didn't want this trip to the patisserie to be in vain, so I purchased an almond croissant and madeleine and happily went my way. \n\nThe almond croissant was so fresh, airy, and flaky. The almond filling was not overly sweet. I'm definitely going back for the chocolate one... The madeleine was the underdog of the evening. It was simply AMAZING. I've had a lot of madeleines in my lifetime and this was the most perfect madeleine I've ever had. It was moist, cakey, not dry at all, and slightly crispy on the edges (I totally dig crispy). $3 for the croissant and madeleine. I highly recommend both! But, really, don't overlook the madeleines!\n\nAlso, the service here was great. I also saw tons of beautiful tarts and cakes that would be perfect for a birthday celebration.\n\n**Update: I did make it back for chocolate croissant and it was as consistent as the almond croissant. I also tried a vanilla macaroon (which I spied in a huge apothecary jar near the cakes). It was too voluminous and crispy. Not chewy enough.

Here's the reality: I'm not the target audience. Efficient staff, dog-friendly, lots of street parking in the area, some comfy seating in the back, and a couple tables in front and out front. Pretty latte art on my chai latte, which defaulted to soy milk (definitely would recommend any other milk substitute in this beverage). I've tasted better soy lattes elsewhere, and had to force myself to finish it during our long drive home. Baked goods were hedonistically oversized enough to share, but we were pretty disappointed at the lackluster flavor of the glazed horchata donut. There's a drought of java joints in this neighborhood, but I really regretted not fueling up on caffeine while we were still in Center City.", "date": "2017-02-21 20:18:28", "useful": 6, "funny": 3,

One could have a valid argument in saying this is like criticizing Chanel for not carrying cheap handbags, i.e. \"it's just not what they do.\"\n\nNonetheless I would humbly suggest to the folks at Grindcore that having some non-vegan options would expand their customer base.  It's possible that's not what they're interested in and maybe the business serves a dual purpose as some sort of vegan activist community hub.  At the end of the day, though, everyone has to make a living and I just can't deal with soy lattes.  Even B2 is \"too vegan\" for me, but I know that I can at least go there and put cream in my coffee.  Why not have some locally-sourced, organic milk and other dairy around?  Well whatever, Grindcore, go on with your bad selves.\n\nThere is certainly a preponderance of dreadlocks here but I found the atmosphere to be welcoming.  Friendly baristas.  I guess I wasn't even thinking about how my latte was obviously going to have soymilk in it when I ordered it.  For what it was it was alright, but not as good as a normal latte.  I also ordered a peanut butter brownie, which was sweet in kind of an unnatural way and the texture of the thing was a little \"off.\"  I sampled my boyfriend's bagel with sundried tomato \"cream cheese.\"  This is a product that lends itself to veganization more easily and wasn't too bad.\n\nThe total of my items came to $7.02 and I paid with a $10.  When this sort of thing happens at coffeeshops usually they give you the penny or two, but not here.  I received exactly $2.98 in change.  Again maybe this is a thing I can't strictly criticize them for but I was annoyed to receive all that change.\n\nIf I were a vegan punk activist I'd happily pedal there on my bike, ignoring any stop signs that might get between me and my soy.

At the risk of sounding like Mr. Wilson from Dennis the Menace, I have to be honest from my perspective. After hearing great reviews about Grindcore's vegan options, I decided to come to Grindcore to meet with some people for some conversation related to our work. While my initial intention for coming here was to be mindful and welcoming to our vegan friend, I guess I should have known better than to come to a place named Grindcore with \"conversation\" in mind. I read a reviewer here write that the metal music blasting in the background eventually became \"white noise\" to him. Holy cow. I would hate to know what kind of sleep noise machine he has next to his bed at night. With the level the music was playing at, it was nearly impossible to converse. We were basically yelling at each other from across the table. I have no problem with the genre of music, but it was just so loud. I would come back here in the spring or summer months because while I did enjoy the coffee and food, I would have to sit my old self outside. It was just too loud in there. Coffee houses are usually places people come to work, study, converse, meet, etc. I can't imagine people working or studying with the level the music is playing at unless they sat in the bathroom the entire time.", "date": "2013-04-18 17:02:47", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "uEhxIsvbP9bAdH4Wym5ujg", "name": "Jennifer", "review_count": 28, "yelping_since": "2011-09-06 19:51:59", "friends": ["H6EveUDsg9nMgan_z4jEiA", "nMuGqa1AOwmrPkJ0JZfATw", "1ekpL_Q6JoiIBPHmFQtV5Q", "S8RyBYtW_dc82Xa2iqp3SA", "V9LEewSb9wmmyLeW9gEySw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.68, "fans": 1}}

The food and drinks are tasty (this coming from a non-vegan!) and the staff is attentive. The space is also homey and inviting aesthetically.\n\nBut the noise is another story. I went into Grindcore this morning (it's half a block from my house) with the intention of getting some work done. I ordered my green tea (peach) and sat down. The pleasant twee of Belle and Sebastian was playing. Perfect for a rainy, Wednesday morning at 8am. But then, five minutes after settling in, there was an abrasive shift: they almost immediately shuffled over to some loud, shrieking hardcore \"music.\" Needless to say, it was such an assault on the auditory senses that I ended up leaving.\n\nI did briefly consider saying something to the folks behind the counter. But I was conflicted; as a friend reminded me on Facebook, \"Well, 'grindcore,' according to Wikipedia, is 'an extreme genre of music that draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive genres - including extreme metal, industrial music, noise music and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk.' You gotta give it to them -- there's no false advertising!\" \n\nFair enough, I suppose.

But let's be real here....the place is NAMED Grindcore. They're telling us before we walk through the door what kind of music to expect. I took off a star because I personally find the music annoying, but hey--they warned us!  :)\n\nSide note about music: If you come in before about 10am, the music is intentionally a lot calmer. I used to work from my laptop in Grindcore 3-4 days a week for 8 hours a day, and I've heard the Jackson 5 play on more than one occasion!\n\nNow on to the wonderful things! The staff here is seriously the friendliest, happiest staff I've ever seen. I always feel comfortable ordering and talking to everyone, and there's always a funny drawing on the tip jar (Bart Simpson and Han Solo have made appearances on the tip jar recently, haha). Super friendly!\n\nI actually hate coffee, but I can attest to be tea and tea lattes being fabulous! Especially the earl grey, my absolute favorite. And OMG, if you can make it during the fall when they have special seasonal flavors, get the pumpkin pie tea latte. It takes like liquid pie and is HEAVENLY. My husband is a big coffee drinker, and Grindcore coffee is his favorite! He buys the bags of ReAnimator coffee that they sell, and they're nice enough to grind it for him. He also keeps a can of Folger's at home, but he refers to Grindcore's as \"the good stuff,\" haha.\n\nThe food is also great! Fresh sandwiches that are always delicious (try the Kropotkin!), the salad is super yummy, and you can get a variety of toasted bagels with vegan cream cheese (Tofutti). They also have Vegan Treats desserts (delivered every Thursday), ABC cookies, and fresh bananas.\n\nThey have tons of seating, including a few outdoor tables that usually have adorable dogs sitting at them, a couch in their back room, and a counter and high table in the front. The back room where most of the seating is hosts a bookshelf known as The Radical Library, and there's artwork from local artists all over the walls. The artwork does tend to get a little creepy sometimes--bloody skulls, demonic-looking things, strange animals killing things--and that's the only other thing besides the music that would make me take away a star.\n\nAll in all, friggin' FANTASTIC place, and you really need to go! Just bring headphones if grindcore isn't your thing.  :)", "date": "2014-07-05 22:05:22", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "UyUsXJGJfb4XJSeO4x4S-A", "name": "Kristina", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2014-07-05 21:20:52", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.67, "fans": 2}}

The metal and hardcore music is harsh at first, but the point of this place is a coffee shop with hard background music, eventually you will catch some really nice jams; drum-soloy, experimentally, focus enducing music. Helps get work completed. Not too draggy. That's the V. I. P. man. It's what standouts. I'm usually annoyed by coffee shop music, so getting used to this was easy. I liked this a lot in the end, the best things take a bit to absorb. But the metal music will definitely scare you at first if you aren't used to it.\n\nThe Vegan dillema. Grind carries rice, almond, coconut, and soy milk to plop in your coffee cup. I'm a big fan of the rice, haven't had it in ages. No hemp milk though. I'll forgive. The food is healthy, and just ok so far, this is Grindcore's only weekness. It's a universal Vegan burden. I had the Seiten sandwich and it was filling and tasty but a bit dry, the organic chip brand they carry, Beanfields, are the best organic chips I've chipped up. Coffee wise it might be lacking as well. But I'll have to get back to you on that, 10 more bottomless cups to go.\n\nIt took me awhile to absorb all the good sense. But it's here. This place lives up to all my expectations. La Colombe (Frankford) and Grindhouse are tied in my books as far as best coffee shops around Philly, but they are two entirely different places. \n\nI removed a star because this place IS missing something, honestly it's probably a large amount of small things. The service could be friendlier, the seating could be comfier, the food could be slightly more non-vegan friendly as it's tough to invite people here and have them enjoy the food.", "date":

It's great to have a place to go where you dont have to worry about what you order and whether they remembered to make it vegan or not. It's also great to have a place with more options than just soy! The tea list is nice and extensive and the staff is super friendly! Tip your baristas, it's just common practice AND these people are really helpful!\n\nWith that said, I was initially excited hearing about this place having events, a free library, movie screenings, art shows, etc., but sadly it doesn't seem to be the radical space that I was thinking it might be. The events are few and far between and seem poorly organized while the art shows have been problematic on a number of occasions (The current on display features unquestionably exoticised women and a previous one was graphically triggering). Also, it's good to hear different music in a cafe, and I realize the name is \"grindcore house\" but I've never heard a female-fronted band play over the speakers here. As a radical space, doesn't that seem exclusionary? There are countless bands that fit the sonic vibe of Grindcore House that aren't just male-fronted. Please realize that radical women and non-male identified people come here too and know better than to think that Madball is the epitome of \"radical anarcho-vegan hardcore.\" C'mon.

It was very cute inside. I liked the plant on the shelf. It was very inviting. We had no idea it was a vegan spot!! My first tip off was the myriad selection of milks available (but no cow milk on the list!). We said what the heck, we're already here and there are no other coffee spots around. It was about 10 minutes before close (I know, thats rude!) But the barista was very nice. I ordered a mocha and my husband ordered a hot chocolate. My beverage was delicious!! I liked it just as much as I would have liked my usual dairy version. Dare i say even more so?? It wasn't too sweet which is exactly how i like my mocha. The barista took the time to make the pretty design on the foam. I like that attention to detail. They don't do that at starbucks. My husbands hot chocolate was also really tasty, it even came with a vegan whipped cream (How did they do that? I have no idea!) The only negative he said was his hot chocolate could have been hotter. After experiencing the Grindcore House i  thought maybe, just maybe I could be a vegan. And anyone who knows me knows I love meat. But for a second there, I really entertained the thought. This vegan stuff is good.\n\nP.S We didn't dine in, so I didn't care about the music.

If you're open to try some soy/ coconut/ almond milk, and truvia or sugar cane sugar, you're in for a treat.  Their coffee is strong and yummy.  They have the full array of lattes, machiatos, and teas made by a staff of people that are of the rad hipster variety, and always friendly... like bumping into an old friend.  If you're anything like me, you'd be pleased to learn that for under three dollars, you can get a pretty awesome bottomless cup for coffee with all the fixins, and spend a decent chunk of time in their cozy back room with free wifi and lots of power outlets.\n\nMy sweet tooth has been out of order lately... haven't really had the craving, but they have 1/2 price vegan donuts on Fridays, tons of pies, cakes, cupcakes, and even VEGAN CANOLI'S?  Rejoice Italian vegans!!!  I eat dairy, but i can certainly appreciate this after a brief stint as a vegan... and a canoli lover to the core.\n\nThen when you get hungry and overcaffeinated, you gotta try the sandwiches!!!  I've been a believer in the seitan sandwich for quite some time now.  They're SO good that they're actually the reason I don't come here every day of my life.  I can't restrain myself.  Even carnivores admit they're delicious, but as a vegetarian, to have a filling, protein packed sandwich that is quite a treat.  They're quite sizable too, and not very expensive.  In keeping with the vegan theme the sandwich doesn't even have cheese!!!  How can you make something so good without cheese?  Mind- blown.\n\nThen there's the music.  It's no Starbucks, that's for sure.  I can get down with some punk jams, alt/ indie stuff.  99% of the time, the music is great.  Every now and then, someone will call me from work and there will be some scream-o tune on and I'll cringe... but if that's the biggest problem I'm having, we're all doing just fine!\n\nGo here.  It's locally owned, its fresh, it's tasty, it's moderately priced, its green, and it's coffee.  You'll leave feeling awake, full, and just a bit cooler.

I can't even begin to tell you how much my lovely neighborhood of Pennsport NEEDED some place for us to hang out. There is basically nothing by sketchy bars and seedy bodegas and while I do find the charm in that, I can't really study or get coffee or something mildly healthy to eat at those places. Thank you for existing, Grindcore House. Thank you thank you thank you THANK YOU. \n\nAnyway, this place is still in kind of \"test run\" mode. They only have drip coffee and tea at the moment (their green tea is delish) and a small assortment of vegan pastries, but they will be having a full vegan menu and beverage menu soon. I love that it's all vegan, too. Using coconut milk to sweet coffee is the most amazing in thing in the world and this is one of the few places that makes it happen. I haven't tried their pastries yet but my dear friend Caitlin V. loved her zucchini bread. I'm looking forward to see what they do in terms of a menu in the future. \n\nThe space itself is also really nice. It looks a lot smaller than it is but there is a back room that is a really cozy, homey, and relaxed space. They also have art showings there so if you're an artist I'd jump on it now - I have a feeling it may get hard to show in here soon. \n\nAlso, this may be kind of a \"duh\" statement but they really do play grindcore here. Not my bag and kind of makes studying hard but at least they mix it up with something mellow. Otherwise this would not be a good place to study. \n\nTheir hours, at least for now, are 3-8. Grindcore House people, PLEASE stay open until 8 forever. Coffee shops with later hours are few and far between and are severely needed for us students.

Living in South Philly, there are tons of coffee shops to choose from. I live really close to Ultimo, Black and Brew, Chayya, B2, and Benna's. Despite that, unless the weather is awful I always go the extra distance to hang out at Grindcore House. The coffee is really solid, and for $2.44 (with tax) you get ENDLESS cups of the stuff. You could theoretically get there right when they open and stay until they close, drinking cup after cup for under $2.50. Amazing! If I'm there for a marathon work session, I generally go through 4 or 5 cups, eat a bagel with one of their delicious flavored toffuti's (no cream cheese, everything here is vegan) and maybe have a vegan cookie and I don't spend even close to $10. They have coconut, almond, rice, and soy milks out on the counter, plus agave syrup, simple syrup, honey, and sugar in the raw, all for free. Although I haven't had the sandwiches, they're reasonably priced and look pretty tasty and filling. The staff is friendly and service is quick.\n\nGrindcore House is also a really nice place to hang out. The backroom is spacious, with a comfortable couch, a bunch of tables and lots of natural light. It's always comfortable temperature-wise, there's fast and free wifi, a number of wall plugs, and if you forgot a book there's a whole library of anarchist/radical literature to browse. I've never had a problem with the music being too loud, as some people mention in other reviews. If I don't like what's playing (and it's actually a big mix of metal, hip hop, psyche, shoegaze, punk, and other stuff), I have a regular pair of earbud headphones and my ipod and that blocks out the music Grindcore House is playing altogether.

I would've been here every single morning. Amazing! A vegan paradise! \n\nMy favorite is the \"Tree Hugger\" salad mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, avocado, olives and a yummy, crunchy seed mixture topping. Choose from shiitake mushroom dressing or goddess. The mushroom is my go to! Delicious!! I alternate between that and sometimes a toasted everything bagel with jalape\u00f1o cream cheese with spinach, tomato, avocado and cucumbers. Both great choices! \n\nTheir cakes are bananas! Carrot cake, Speculoos bombs, chocolate covered cannoli. Wowza! Delicious! Not just by vegan standards either! They now carry Dotties Donuts as well! \n\nCoffee and teas complete with a fixings bar....almond milk, soy milk, raw sugars, agave. Yea baby! I'm a big fan of their lavender syrup which they make in house from freshly ground lavender and a tad of raw sugar. Iced chai is another favorite! Oh, and They carry my favorite Synergy Kombucha too! .   \n\nThe back room is very cute and relaxing. Small tables and couches. Dog friendly! Many people doing work on their computers too. They have books for both adults and kids! The cutest vegetarian kids books ever! Take note of all the flyers on the wall! There's some cool happenings and business that are posted! I always find some hidden gem up there! \n\nThere are a couple outdoor tables which is lovely in this quieter neighborhood. There's also a bar by the window in the front of house. \n\nSuper chill.

It's honestly like walking into a high school drama scene. There is one tall girl (always with a straight face and attitude), one short girl (with a lot of make up), and one taller guy (that also always has an attitude). They all can't help but talk ALL the time and very clearly talk about me whenever I walk in. \n\n(Insight to what happened): I remember a year or so ago, the tall girl was new and she didn't know the difference between their own menu's \"little\" vs. \"less\" options for sugar and ice. So she tried correcting me when I said two of the same options, as I always did, and she gave me an attitude when asking me if I meant the opposite. I said, \"no, I meant this\" and pointed it out to her on the menu. EVER SINCE THEN this child has had an attitude with me and spread it to her closer-in-age coworkers. They always, always, always have an issue with me whenever I walk in. It's so baffling that they hold a grudge over something she got wrong. Is she that embarrassed/insulted that she has to put people down or is she just that sad of a human being where it boosts her ego to make people feel inadequate and a waste of her precious time? It's ridiculous to me, with all the bad reviews I've seen, that they're still working there. Thank goodness I don't go here anymore. Nobody needs that kind of negativity in their life. \n\nDrinks/Food: Always nice to have from time to time, but it is a little expensive for pre-made, powdered tea. Plus, there are much better options around Chinatown. Even making it at home tastes better, to be honest.\n\nAtmosphere: Dimly lit, usually loud music, on-and-off crowds of customers, but I haven't been here that consistently to say it's still like that.

Boba tea just felt right to us, even though it was a chilly day. I personally wanted to come here to try the macarons because I had my heart set on those yummy pastries for dessert. \n\nAtmosphere:\nOne of the more spacious boba tea shops in Chinatown. When I first walked in, it looked like it would be a trendy bar in the city except that they sell boba tea and bakery goods. The place was clean and also relatively empty because it was midday. The lighting is different in different areas of the shop. There are black lights in some areas while other areas have dim lighting for playing games like Jenga or Uno. Overall, the place is dimly lit for a boba tea shop, but I am pretty sure it was their intention to create this certain ambiance. \n\nFood/Drinks:\nMy friends ordered coconut milk tea and KF oolong tea while I ordered the pumpkin oolong milk tea. I like boba tea shops that allow customers to customize the sweetness levels of the drinks. We all ordered the drinks with full sugar and it wasn't over sweet. My first friend ordered her drink and a tiramisu to go. Like me, my second friend wanted macarons too so she ordered 6 macarons: rose, matcha, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, and raspberry. I only got 2 macarons (pistachio and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) because they were $2.50 each. They were a bit sweet for my liking but I still ate them both. Also, I am confused as to why the macarons aren't advertised well. The price of the macarons are clearly posted on a make shift sign in big font. Yet, the flavors of the macarons are posted in small font on the side of the metal bar frame on an even smaller make shift sign. Wouldn't it make sense to print a big make shift sign of the available flavors and it posted right next to the make shift sign with the price?? And also possibly label each flavor on the shelves where people can clearly read them accordingly?\n\nPrice: \nAs I mentioned before, the macarons were $2.50 each. The price of boba tea here is typical of boba tea shops (between $2.50-$4 for medium size) so it's relatively in expensive. However, they do charge 50 cents extra for boba, which I personally do not like. I have been to many successful boba tea shops that do not have to charge extra for boba and they are the places I always go back to. I can understand charging extra for extra toppings, but bobas should be universally served at no charge. It seems to be the trend for getting boba tea shops in Chinatown Philly. I also found it odd that the cashier put the macarons in a cup. Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter. \n\nService:\nThe staff seems friendly but a bit offstandish. I understand it was the middle of the day, but the cashier who was taking orders didn't seem to care about servicing customers in a timely order. When my friend was ordering her macarons, the cashier rudely cut her off mid sentence and asked how many she was getting. After she took her drink order and order for macarons, she put the macarons in a boba tea cup and walked away to seal the cup. When she came back, she was just standing there purposely not taking my order even though I was clearly ready to order. i just stood there and stared at her for 30 seconds until she looked up from doing nothing but ignoring me. she then replied \"next\" as if I weren't standing there the whole time waiting to order.  No greeting at all preceding her \"what are you getting\" comment. So, I told her \"Can I get a  medium pumpkin oolong milk tea with full sug....\" when she rudely cut me off and told me my total. So, I promptly tell her \"I'm not done yet. I also want 2 macarons - 1 pistachio and 1 creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\" She tells me my new total and walks away with my cup of macarons to seal it while another lady who was standing near by tenders my cash. \n\nIt's a good thing i know how to make my own boba tea at home. I'll just make homemade pumpkin oolong BOBA tea the next time I crave it. i don't think I will be coming back here.", "date": "2016-12-03 20:24:53", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "PfcvlusUSE4SGU7c4drpLQ", "name": "Mary", "review_count": 68, "yelping_since": "2012-05-09 21:13:09", "friends": ["UIirwC0r6QBIAdrCIoTIXg", "pWOb4BTGuPyhqo7BQixOLQ", "0SIwrD5yVnB5970oofnNaQ", "SIy7n1QKjCueLK2ohptfiQ", "CaE3EPBhVtVaRGS9rITEqQ", "WtvEzcNKyjvZJBjyTIab3g"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.99, "fans": 0}}

Unfortunately, after my first visit (and maybe last visit for awhile) to this place, I was left utterly disappointed. \n\nI think there are still some kinks they need to work out in terms of the quality of the product they are making. Since this was my first visit, I wanted to stick to the basics so I ordered a Kung Fu bubble milk tea. I asked if they use real milk since I am lactose intolerant and the girl who took my order said they don't use real milk at all-- they use a powdered creamer type thing (it's dairy free). Sounded strange, but OK I can live with that. When I got my drink, it was super thick. UGH! Not the light liquidy milk tea I am use to. I think they probably got the ratio of creamer to tea wrong. The tea left a gritty film in my mouth. Not to mention, there were way too much boba in my drink. I love boba, but there has to be a good tea-to-boba balance so I don't spend all my time chewing. Half my drink was filled with boba and the boba was a bit too mushy for my taste. Aside from the milk+boba issue, my husband ordered the longan honey tea with grass jelly and boba. It was like drinking pure syrup...I know you can customize the sweetness, but if this is the standard then there is going to be a lot more people with diabetes!

Seems like a sweet deal but don't be fooled. My sisters and I came here to find out if it was worth all the hype. Long story short: it wasn't. \n\nThe staff at Kung Fu Tea was curt and less-than-friendly, which is not my normal experience with bubble tea places. It was likely due to the volume but I would hope the staff could handle it since it seems like a popular place. Needless to say, I overestimated them. \n\nThe cashier girl was terrible at explaining herself, leading to our purchase of 5 drinks for the price of three. Our original intention was to buy four for the price of two (even numbers are clearly the key here) but she charged us for 3 and \"gave us the fifth free.\" That makes very little sense to me as the second and fourth should've been free and a third drink should never have been added to the tab in the first place. \n\n3 customers who paid after we did got their tea before we did and of the five drinks, two were made incorrectly. One had extra lychee jelly, when we specifically asked for just bubbles and one had no bubbles at all! A sixty percent success rate isn't very satisfying. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager but was denied. Of course, we left irritated. \n\nWould I recommend this place?

I recently went and ordered a cold winter melon tea with cream on top (thought it was salt foam). It was whack. It just tasted like milk and no tea flavor. When I order my regular winter melon tea (hot or cold) i ask \"no sugar\". Some employees say ok, while others say you need at least 50%. I dunno who is right or wrong. Some employees make it well, while others make it taste like sugar water. I always beat myself up if the drink comes out overly sweet or with no tea flavor at all. It's pricey for just premixed tea!!! I usually skip the bubbles or jelly because i'm poor and can't afford the up charge of .50 cents. I hate to compare, but toppings are FREE in NYC! And its like $1-2 cheaper for the same drink! LOL. It cost me $2 for a large winter melon tea with bubbles in NYC but $4 for same drink (which is made incorrectly). \n\nI'm trying to cut back on coffee so i replace it with tea.

Don't get me wrong, the bubble tea was still high quality. I tried the Kung Fu Milk Bubble Tea, Kung Fu Milk Green Tea, Kung Fu Taro Bubble Tea, and the Pineapple Sunshine. All were great with a distinct sharp aftertaste that seemed to be unique to KFT and was quite awesome.\n\nThe things I didn't like though were:\n- The workers seemed very inexperienced. They were slow with the drinks, hesitant, and didn't seem to really know what they were doing.\n- The macarons and cheesecake were so VERY overpriced. $2.25 for a 2\" macaron? Seriously? And $4.50 for cheesecake...? You're in Chinatown...you're not a Starbucks. \n\nI just really hope they pick it up, especially the service. I'm so much more impressed with service at Tea Do, but I might be back to KFT for the flavors, the bubbles (very chewy and fresh!), and the seating (it's quite large and comfy like an actual cafe you can get some work done in).

Not sure how she got the job there.\nUnnecessary ghetto music in the background.\nThe lightning is also a bit club-y.\nGhetto music + club lightning = attracting ghetto high school / college kids.\n\nThe good:\nTheir drinks on the sweet side? Really? I couldn't tell. You can adjust the sugar level anyway. But really.. I don't get why would you go to Bubble Tea place and expect unsweetened or very very very little sugar on your drinks. It's like going to McDonalds and ordered burger without cheese and a diet coke, with small fries.\n\nIt's street parking in Chinatown. Expect a hard time finding one, if you're driving.\nNormal bubble tea price. East coast's isn't any cheaper than west coast's bubble teas.\n\nIt's definitely my favorite spot for bubble tea for now.\n\n3 stars for all them bad and.., lack of Popcorn Chicken. ..like seriously.. these bubble tea places need to have $4 or $4.50 popcorn chicken on their menu.\n-\n\nPS: Chinese/Korean songs are fine. No Japanese anime songs please. Definitely NO in da hood gang bang bam bam shots songs.. you're attracting wrong group. Please stop turning into Tea-Do; and at the same time don't become too boring and cramped like Tea Talk.", "date": "2014-07-02 08:55:27", "useful": 0, "funny": 3, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "b2YL4kdvU7Nx8mMhqfyXgg", "name": "Yohann", "review_count": 186, "yelping_since": "2010-07-17 13:34:47", "friends": ["Kuh9nDdemPPHcJ2Yvfkefg", "ximZB2ooy66sEusKVVwvqA", "I9ioNKceywb4UMpppbF54A", "pWhaWrBMYyykptjvCO_60A", "IeIWMCtbMNuPLoVOxxdzMg", "oEF4G8QaurGU7SbA92UF8Q", "kMQUd8BWqo9pN98BwnW8Rg", "6WG2IGTVr-xKn0pYQZJGjw", "2tWtAu1ppRUx9BMm1XHSBA", "bXPsxvWprM_ZfUlon_TrXA", "0lX3gbniIawXeSkNoJuooQ", "m5Gj-uPJzHSQVJw0qyzPRw", "WStKy6DwpfqtuzPy9wr_FQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "Gstw7erE6199OMgsbFAqWA", "hcCqxeDeSlwX_t46GjrzGw", "C4TAVOCVxRIsLs5KDg7Qgw", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "KT8R3QH79uy8CZO-8c5VnA", "9L3MxergWHqmK7wgDdoCGg", "sbz_MhjUkRG4tikC09Rc2g", "0MJ5sKX5uq7Ma5hbl4l3BQ", "ooOdMu4BchfGH58mezhzGg", "EedIGKDzo0W9ZDtQ4zh8WA", "I09EsnPHCZGawRRzddi50A", "TzebBlDjhiMkAyPlPJpFOg", "0tx4atH584_RX5Sxnnoy_Q", "t6n2kR_1cprEaztIB5cT7g", "Oftucpaww6UVANZcsHMPkw", "YcYa8S_XAnnMJQhB3AWYCQ", "TfkQBgL65nl4-TeHhNKxoQ", "5NJm-xp30cAtShvK2htigA", "AxbHvSKpDejCPorrrnh7Bg", "rCpvn4w7DnHAWM2ZV1rmyA", "VNEOfYut50Tl-_4j3h7Rtw", "u1QQqhuG8waTTHK6FwjvbQ", "WAxbSgELhEZTNCfPpO6GLQ", "-SWVbVHVO3t3jgPmar4tjg", "Ef0ND_0ZIM0qfo4krHB7MQ", "-AfM3951JMnpL18QkQNRdQ", "oB6G0rB-m1E6sPM6-yDjLA", "i8cOi9DtvKX4kz3BnXYvHA", "F_Q_JuUkYJRgZo6KtGjUmQ", "GEHOgAhUNO5ubajS-Xd4UQ", "ubDJDN4ewsCoC8Esh4q-mg", "U_KAZGdoL3QuFqus1GUo-A", "5GLB61xLOP6T-pNsr7rslg", "eG1WSELTeUuxj4K7LqjA2Q", "HiqAFIJPigrtzq8JTabWRA", "safEeU66pcHzxWpKxw5HxQ", "vaq5ckPKnrmwQSUe9Oa-pg", "DlFvxl33-ErfzuwwYmFAXQ", "dFq-DDKAfi-BbkZfHoLZ2g", "7nq09jiKpW9xw9J9iKUbpg", "qiNpmo4xhQArjJ1Dor98rQ", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "s8gK7sdVzJcYKcPv2dkZXw", "k5UCft86k9IwBF8gPrmcZA", "cVktMui_ApZTRWrOrLiLoA", "sGaoPWB_p1aOm5z9cnV3Aw", "SIcsPmH9YnK-VDudAkEwxA", "a3ZprXiZ6akAFig2eQckDg", "FnCguUisykYl3fsgOfjeaw", "xQdYCR5RMYPRDOu8kGlOyw", "FRVPFpMuMVPHT2V8MM2tGQ", "JII45x2AkOTFE1hywS3n1g", "XJyON7P1KzlvsMkopO9EDA", "C3A9_p5GJT9UKCKbgfvSig", "A83xfSiZbdZ_HO00BD7aOw", "U8zApucx3_B92sqmEdUs9w", "T7w-ljqn5l2HsFrNK2DFIQ", "b6qedMiv8kRZHmDCYCl_Cg", "2LxlkB5qMnRsT_bNbXJQSQ", "QVoy32vmYsjcusOu5ITpDw", "1ddK8ptKqEFrBuWJiL4gCQ", "uTzCEHvFRQ5a6qwvS-Dd3g", "2an7IYTxf-RIKK-t0V2_qQ", "ZiM6tM8stl-daULB7zBl_Q", "X8qRd9ySpwDkyKfM--yTgw", "4lXwcTkAaoZoO17y9eOljQ", "5NJFtJ_p_ZvLhFY92m_qzw", "WPBrjBbk76ZtZQ8QpG09cQ", "NyVcSN5FgDuJPDIVyRYh5Q", "5aUPgxUecPieT5iaZNXPMg", "I2cqs0W5FnfIcayb8yAbKg", "gPnaOBb6Qh0uc4aNFbiaPw", "TWXrt4o2aLRtVKqWVHa2zg", "8UpGypueR0RMta1Wk9WO0g", "D2kcKhrwCPuKZoFSbLcOrA", "yha1H552GDli2FxToPrqww", "en8poi9zbp_cYHFiooQP5g", "3_VkBGptU9eZ8KwNjOdROg", "tzsgZgo9PRo5WydK9Mth1w", "x8Sr9M6XkgmnxJxoxtJBNQ", "rin1Hal3wFpmTPyC3IBxTg", "DtczN7a1mJA93UuloU_5Hg", "Rz_cXkuJbEZ8tUFaw1rzkw", "yjvA4ZdyZn_azHdq1CPBXg", "vYJGJAmZIAu09XqrEieGHA", "v24b37RbP6FZc_ruLSH_dw", "ievlTlt3rcgmOdxslAZPiA", "ttOvhzRxbcnkaMPpXpgErw", "P3Hj0b3UM7q0OzfcvwWrBw", "3tdqDSVZGFL51Psq1ArLaA", "ZxA2IsXk7WwfKyz_6vvD3A", "G7_xCBD6efnlmibqKQJv4g", "v5ZpEFwjL9iH0g1hkUd7vw", "fqeb6a1Ly770iRx7PNqH-w", "q2t4PyAnTnY8bcX6SYN36Q", "BSGnxWCANH5HixI7wyv4lQ", "tIzzeOSoJoOEdOBSdJ1DbA", "d8g_M9cqGSdBdM4OZW4uSw", "zlbfex6QesqkenqAWUsh_g", "_SpHa3guKZ-wXx_c3sOBTw", "1t-tLPEqcMWY-WrtkXetkQ", "YT_oxuwV390uUf97H6PCEg", "RjN92ZB7PbBNuyVF_f5ZRA", "f-jEtNHP0qX6zBuY6ovPHA", "J3BK41EJiHqT43BluIm88g", "UpzgM9KFZ_dlvR06BkrCzg", "CYwI4dZhlgZr_3NmHwr4Vg", "VTS-z0lJCGKcqhSEQZQzbg", "2_ywa1JQUjFTghq5mW77nA", "grbbdSu6j1_lazg8Eyeo7Q", "qK7RqnVUdxIbSTo4A1sQoQ", "Mv32eLnYMpK9amRgJuJZjQ", "RWzX-YdABiQQizJBMGEo7A", "uuxtrGh2kkfazR5o4M4Uzg", "NrUB1OeKeyw6m-AeoYbrRA", "5y2Er6NRk-SNXQgrXSJQMQ", "DVAqVv4Uj310b6HX8f1_lQ", "rsKZL50mvZhJArcymOPgPg", "3mlQZaCX-pFob9DjROekAw", "KRES9zuuFTUPS2ztsBEl2Q", "1vlR2s7uFs3URkcDXLFJ-Q", "xpDLoSKyGJfpedVjWJ9jnQ", "w2pJTNHhMLlRspA_a2LNFw", "5Ah_Yxsc4oS88Zr8k7J0zA", "WBUJa8Za2WxFfC_LWnojwg", "UwaMDl_qcISqW9gbKzggzg", "Rml5uuImpu5QlLQWReWvCg", "goUttWoUvwVK2wyKhSutzg", "2JIis-qQAj6WEub2cSnD9Q"], "elite": ["2010", "2011"], "average_stars": 4.04, "fans": 4}}

I'm not a huge fan of their bubble teas or their prices. The drinks were extremely expensive as my total came up to be almost $14 for those two drinks. Their sweets such as cake and macaroons ended up being pretty pricey, too, which is why I decided not to order them. The teas tasted okay, but were overly sweet without my personal input to the workers making it. \n\nHowever, the atmosphere was very nice. This place is super spacious with huge booths in the back for large groups and has longer tables to seat many as well. With dim lighting and Jenga to keep guests busy, it's a fun place to hang out with friends! \n\nI won't be back specifically for the drinks, but I will return if my friends and I ever decide to cool down and enjoy a drink someplace spacey like Kung Fu Tea.\n\nIf you're looking for quality bubble tea, Tea Do and K.C Bakery's would definitely be a better choice. As for sweets, a newly opened place called Audobon is available with better priced macaroons and macaroon ice creams!

I've tried all the other bubble tea places in Chinatown (Rising Tide, Tea Magic, Tea Do, Tea Talk, etc) and this place is the best! \n\n\nPros:\n--Extensive menu\n--Genuine tea taste, all milk teas actually taste like the real tea + milk!\n--Their drinks are not too sweet\n--The bubbles in their bubble tea are the right size and the right chewiness\n--All their milk teas (not just the wow milk) are lactose free! I'm lactose intolerant like a lot of people of Asian decent so I love that their milk teas tastes genuinely like milk yet won't make me miserable later. Other places have lactose free drinks, too, but I think they use cheap non-dairy substitute like coffee mate. \n--They seal their cups with plastic making them easy to transport.\n\nCons:\n--The sugar level in their drinks are supposedly adjustable but every time I tell them \"half-sugar\", they either tell me they don't adjust the sugar level in their milk teas or they say \"okay\" and the drink ends up tasting like normal.\n--$5 minimum for card is kinda inconvenient. This pretty much forces you to either get a large, buy for your friend, or go get cash from the shady ATM across the street.\n--They run out of ingredients if you go after 7pm! Once they had no bubble left, another day no matcha left. Maybe it will get better once the hype dies down. They did just open and all the Asians are flocking to this place!\n\nItems to avoid:\n--Matcha red bean slush. It's too sweet, and I don't think sugar level is adjustable for that! \n-- Gourd tea. My friend ordered this and it tastes like that Yeo'n gourd drink from a can! This is not tea at all, more like gourd sugar water. \n--Wow milk. The classic or oolong milk tea is much better than the wow milk! The wow milk taste like milk tea with a caramel/brown sugar added. It's not tea, it's not coffee. My friend likes the wow milk but I didn't care for it. It's not the worst thing you can get though.", "date": "2014-06-23 23:00:00", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA", "name": "Yingbo", "review_count": 294,

This time I went to take a friend and help him experience boba tea for the first time. What I noticed that was different this time was that they got rid of the visuals of what toppings they offered. Last time the toppings were in jars so that customers could see and taste test what they were. Also, there was very limited options in toppings. Unlike Teado, they don't offer a lot of options for jellies. My favorite jellies are mango and lychee which they didn't have but other places I've been to like Teado and SnoCream (see review) did. What I did like was the amount of options they gave you in terms of customizing your order. They have a specific scale on how much ice you want and how much sugar/sweetness you wanted. This is very helpful for those picky customers like me. In terms of flavor, I got the coconut milk tea with boba and my friend got the regular milk tea with boba. The tapioca bobas were al dente, not too mushy and not too hard. The flavor was also good for both drinks. They also had a good variety of flavors but what I wish they would elaborate on their menus what was in each drink like flavors and toppings etc. The cashier was very helpful and tentative of our orders and they came out correctly. The atmosphere is very modern, like Teado, and they had a good seating layout with booths in the back of the room. They also had options for snacks which I didn't try but would like to in the future. Fun Fu Teas is a great place to take people unfamiliar with boba tea as well as boba connoisseurs like myself. But with that said, I still prefer Teado (passion fruit green tea with mango and lychee jellies are too addictive).", "date": "2015-12-19 05:33:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user":

Kung Fu Tea was one of the many places I travelled to in order to really familiarize myself with the Philly bubble tea game.\n\nOne of the first things I heard about Kung Fu Tea was that it has Oreo milk tea (!!!). Especially since Oreo isn't a common flavor for bubble tea's primary demographic, I was particularly curious to see what this particularly odd flavor had to offer me.\n\nThe atmosphere of KFT resmbles that of a lounge--with a Jenga game here, a dartboard there, free wifi, and a ton of seating areas in a dark but cozy environment, this cafe seems like it has seen its fair share of daytime and late-night customers. While the staff seems friendly, they also appear to be ready to respond to a rowdy customer at all times, maintaining a no-nonsense attitude that seems a bit inappropriate for a nice and sunny Saturday afternoon.\n\nI got an Oreo bubble tea at 70% sugar and an almond bubble tea. They were unfortunately not able to reduce the sugar in the almond tea, as it actually included no additional sugar. While I was expecting something extremely sweet as a result, I ended uppleasantly surprised that my drink was the perfectly sweetened and the almond flavor came through perfectly. The Oreo drink had a strange texture to it since the bubbles and the bits of Oreo just didn't fit right together, but overall it was an interesting drink and a good way to attract more customers. The tapioca pearls were also perfectly chewy, which was a huge plus.\n\nOverall, not bad! I'm looking forward to revisiting Kung Fu Tea to sample its snacks and other flavors. Just be sure to get at least two drinks if you're planning on using a card.", "date": "2015-10-24 10:23:46", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "I7MEpdpTMTSW3xELsSbaEA", "name":

I don't have to travel all the way to NYC for Kung Fu Tea anymore!\n\nWhat makes Kung Fu Tea different from the other bubble tea joints in Philly is that their bubbles actually have flavor and has just the right amount of chewiness. The normal drinks are a bit more sweet compared to the NYC chains, but you can choose how much sugar you want in your drink (I usually go for 30% little sugar). I also ask for less ice so I can get more tea in my cup :). \n\nI've tried the traditional black milk tea, passion fruit green tea, golden oolong tea, golden oolong milk tea, and yogurt green tea. The black milk tea is pretty good. The passion fruit green tea is a bit watered down. I prefer Tea Do's passion fruit green tea with lychee jelly. The golden oolong tea, with and without milk, is nothing special. Despite going to Kung Fu Tea about 20 times this year, I've only tried those 5 drinks. This is because... the yogurt green tea is SO FRICKIN GOOD. I have an insatiable craving for it ALL THE TIME. If you like yakult, you'll love this drink. I really want to try other drink flavors, but I can't give up the yogurt green tea. I might have to order 2 drinks from now on...\n\nUpdate: Golden Oolong milk tea (hot) is GREAT too!!! My go to drink for the winter. The lychee punch (cold) is sweet, flavorful, and perfect for the summer :).\n\nAlso, I know the macarons look good in the fridge, but skip it. They are small, overpriced, too sweet, and the flavor is mediocre. Just stick with the drink and go else where for your macarons and desserts.", "date": "2014-08-17 05:47:18", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "Xi1fNcAQ0aORKCV-eTfNXQ", "name": "Jessica", "review_count": 31, "yelping_since": "2012-08-12 17:15:32", "friends": ["opBf4Yu3puBE3KWYBHxH3A", "R8uX6qJXrNtI6XRvkRNOTQ", "AaxOPcYBb5EO4NppDrCG0w", "j_9teW9tPui31CbaLUv8Bg", "slpyLHWsvPXwj1XPoyjugQ", "v6iCMQivCAj5C2DwWgcKmQ", "HCI0QftUcls0rJJiuL23rA", "4N0_YgUWaxnAwclo_lkM6g", "7hz2smT0xKPoCJLia7TPzA", "uL6A2nva9C0q0TCsaXTIYQ", "0S6EYsRJmmzjb7lM5ugxKQ", "RKULSOrIvvYpDmtuYXEXzA", "PcWcUzT6MuGda2TAZCl4FQ", "goSgTyuJgXGTQzQZqPupEQ", "OB4lW6dvoVtZCs2LTQrekQ", "njBrD5nFzToNuD7emM35Cw", "Us7ijh6LFeXI46BnKX8lKQ", "oJVKlK-tLGMSWbHaHRnh2A", "oEq7CjIuTE11o7DFby6xHw", "yIqnewDxnJ7T6UlK9GwQQg", "LRnjf0sMe5ytzgghuXXJ5Q", "C2xGtUFEYda5w8QEL0q1tA", "1ve39ZHTVxQylcHrl_Gljw", "HKgAmywrBGctUq8S4qIZHw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "VnxrMhGTu2fk249MawvCaw", "qlSh4pv72P9Wecf6wzTR4w", "F6Jd_Nd2UxehJU6tcyPU6w", "56ahm-Yg02JKyHodfqk7KQ", "BzcTU6B58qKZIbiikQBirQ", "Ax2W2agdZHKeHjfrlVa58A"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.49, "fans": 9}}

Oolong! Maybe Taro or Almond! I also love the regular milk tea with Oreo!\n\nI had a crush on one of the girls working here who is really incredible, and makes perfect boba too. I'm not sure if some of the employees here loved or hated me, I couldn't tell, but I think it was one or the other.\n\nThey made me a really great lemon black tea which is really saying something because the vast majority of KFT stores in the Philly area are lacking something, and the drinks don't quite come out as well as I expect based on standards at other KFT regions.\n\nBut none of those problems occurred here. Here, the tapioca was perfect, the drink was deliciousness, so whereas a lot of chains around here get three or four from me for not being up to standards, this one undeniably scores five.\n\nAlong with Tsaocaa and Tea Do, these are the go to bobas to get in Chinatown Philly. Mr Wish can be great, but the Chinatown location is hit or miss. But this KFT has been a hit each time I've been here, so far. Good luck finding parking though. You'll need it.\n\nSo if you have nothing to do\nAnd your partner won't give you a screw\nI know something better\nAnd very much wetter\nGet Lemon Black Tea from Kung Fu!", "date": "2020-01-08

I go here every week if not every other day, and it's consistently great. It's a popular spot to socialize or just to grab a refreshing drink! Like most tea places, they allow you to customize sugar and ice levels, making sure that your drink is what you want. Just be warned, they sometimes don't take credit due to some cap. \n\nHaving been here so many times, I've tried many of their options. The staple drink I get is the Yogurt Lemonade, a lighter supplement to milk tea. It's a blend of lemonade with an asian yogurt drink, definitely worth trying. An even healthier alternative would be the Yogurt Orange; however, they run out of those a lot. \n\nWith milk tea's, I usually opt for the Kung Fu Milk Tea. It's definitely their classic drink, and it never seems to disappoint. I even get two sometimes a night, but I would recommend one as it feels a bit heavy after finishing a large. I've also tried their almond milk tea, which is a bit on the sweeter side. These drinks are definitely great, and they're consistently made well every time. If you plan on saving your drink for later, be sure to get no ice and no boba. I tend to get no ice either way as it leaves more space for the actual drink!\n\nService here is great. They only not operate the store efficiently, but they take good care of the place too. There have been many times I've seen customers leave cups behind, but the workers do a diligent job cleaning up after. I've even witnessed an employee shoveling snow and ice from the front to ensure no one gets injured. Definitely a great place to get tea if not the best place in the area!", "date": "2018-01-03 19:40:19", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "_JCaRjLKQrTy1wdkk6ROpw", "name": "Andrew", "review_count": 93, "yelping_since": "2015-11-16 01:09:25", "friends": ["kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "bMK6giajaU2RuwCD7XZMYw", "atj6ItM0LXIk9zz_i_Itxw", "MidqyIP2_vozrgEjDKrO0A", "GFyA9ULGAeD-xZEPto2y7A", "tNED5YZZkosm0wRLk6VrFw", "yLtz7oZVSqxKOglsi_-Phg", "6BJnVfpu_NwKTgZ7-ihELg", "K_ZOHuFXE-_Sc5TadyoF5Q", "i0wgnVRJt9NgL2t4d5SHeA", "0xH-x_OSwLAEajEyavDNcw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "tZ051-eIZFhfl1o2GrSi8Q", "eNb8medKPaGFHAWDHzvdzw", "IbOZ0z-VSOn6Jm4wi7l-ww", "N2tyALBB0q4mdK0tDBnDJg", "ohK-s6-l1KvOfDSNVYl2Ng", "LWinqJdSeptUcP2jPvryhw", "QH47A8H497OoSGCsXvx-DA", "SWSLkXIvHxd0lH9VO1ISeQ", "yzdGWogCM6D3VZrJGZFZvQ", "mKRRP5ERgsAeV524-_lclA", "9dplFY2fmbuJ7UREMml7Mw", "3C3zSdJyals9cpa9meBz6Q", "lEkCHd_fA-oFjGe51Z1FCg", "qcWWNUEL4JOXFJPuOSqFQA", "KXRSfwxC5tV7qwyX333XzA", "K7OUS9QNKSoWLKkbSWTwMQ", "Kmy0kuiqa6R_lyCLh5WYSw", "mf_HZdU11RR18aYlHgp-xw", "HROR-b4w240nJgpD3dNnIA", "JYw4OmQhq33CijEojhK72A", "2szGjbEbEUHqEpVr6Dmkfg", "i0N4XE7OrT_jP7mtvJNiHA", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "H1DKDA3I0XIA4IIfFju9AA", "L87X91YqAhH9i5Q1rvKmCw", "a-INbb5RWB9RtsNUkpRTFQ"], "elite": ["20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.96, "fans": 7}}

Words can't describe how much I miss home, and I contemplate daily about moving back to California because of how much I miss home and... good milk tea/asian food!! So you can tell I mean business. \n\nI can actually taste the TEA for once! Tea Do (down the street) tastes like straight up sugar and jello .. Paris Baguette/Magic whatever/Tea talk all taste like powder milk water. I have tried everything on the menu at tea do and while the deco/crowd/fancy big menu is alluring.. it doesn't compare to GOOD milk tea.\n\nHere, I recommend the oolong milk tea (less sweet for me please) or the white gourd green tea. The taro milk tea and herbal jelly (basically grass jelly) milk teas are my usual go to at milk tea places and it's decent here but still not as good as back home. \"A little less sweet\" was still a bit too sweet for me so I may go even less in sweetness % next time.\n\nI don't get boba or as you east coasters call it \"bubbles\" :) so I can't vouch for it. The workers are very pleasant and efficiently make my drinks without any long waits.\n\nI think I might be able to survive in Philly after all.. thank you Kung Fu Tea!", "date": "2014-05-30 01:26:46",

However, after having average boba at Tea Do earlier today, I decided to go to KFT because it's a chain and I knew what to expect (and I've almost always had a great experience and yummy boba there). They didn't disappoint this time, either! \n\nI got a medium honey oolong milk tea with boba, full sugar (duh!!), and less ice. I like that you can specify sugar and ice levels, just like in Taiwan. The tea was so tasty! It might be too sweet for some people, but for me, it was perfect and the oolong flavor was delicious. The boba were the right texture; I could tell they hadn't been sitting there for too long getting hard and icky. \n\nOne thing I thought was interesting was that it looked like a club when I walked in. The lights were really dim except for all these black / blue lights. But oh well, the boba was really good and that's all I care about! \n\nAlso, make sure you have cash or order a large drink because they do have a $5 credit card minimum.", "date": "2017-09-08

Short story is- don't get the cheddar/apple omelet.  Long story is- hipsters managing anything is never a good thing.\n\n\nSabrina's, Sabrina's, Sabrina's...what a place!  I'm devoted to the location on the Italian Market; I go there about once every two months or so.  I've even gone for dinner before and had a very pleasant experience.  The two words that come to mind for this place are: consistently wonderful.  So one day I decided to try the Fairmount/Art Museum location.  The atmosphere was very retro chic, the hipsters were oh-so present and the staff was in their usual self involved, semi- friendly state- you know, the norm.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, I decided to go with a semi-normal (or so I thought) dish that was on the healthier side- an omelet with cheddar and apples.  After being served, I took my first bite and couldn't believe my taste buds; there was cinnamon in the apples..no wait- the apples were baked and COVERED in cinnamon.  HUH?  Not only was this not explained on the menu, it seemed to be a pretty standard dish, which was I went with it.\n\nDue to the extremely busy morning, our server never returned to the table, but across the way I saw a hipster who was well dress and seemed to be smiling- must be a manager, I thought.  Naturally, he made his way over to my table and asked how my meal was.  My response was \"well, I ordered this omelet with apples but was surprised to see cinnamon in it\". His response was \"what are you allergic?\".  \"No\", I said, \"But it doesn't state that on the menu and it just seems like an odd choice for an omelet\".  \"Well\", he said, \"that's Sabrina's! We are constantly coming up with interesting combinations\".  He then walked away.  \n\nListen, dude.  (playing the manager card-), I get and even said that I know Sabrina's very well and frequent it (and always order their specials).  All *I* was saying was that you should state that there is cinnamon on the (baked) apples in the menu- that's all.  Not only were you obnoxious and overly dismissive, you could have CARED less about the obvious.  I am a manager myself, and would never even think about handling an upset customer that way.  All you had to say was \"Sorry about that- you make a good point.  How about a free dessert\"?  POOF- the whole thing would have been over and I probably would have declined the dessert.  Instead-  all of the members in my party commented on how unbelievably rude you were, and we all left with a sour (actually sweet) taste in our mouths.\n\nThink I'll stick with the Italian Market location.", "date": "2012-01-18 17:31:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "gRfowce2_RepN4uhhMrhSQ", "name": "april", "review_count": 16, "yelping_since": "2011-08-20 18:32:44", "friends": ["i8DYw4kzcJsuqHd4C2wAHA", "xufNrKk_1YqwU4qWSBlUGw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.65, "fans": 2}}

This is one of the closest brunch caf\u00e9s to my condo, and I avoid it. The wait is horrible.  Once, I waited in line for over an hour. I only waited because my friends heard such great things about the place.  Once we got in, we could only get seating at the counter even though there were 4 of us.  The food was nasty and so was the service.\n \nThey don't have great or fast service. Most of the time the staff is rude and huffy, probably because there are just too many customers crammed in there.\n\nThe eggs aren't made the way you ask, which really pissed me off.  The cream (for coffee) comes in those little plastic packets and its not real cream (it's the watered-down cheap powder crap that tastes like nothing) and the coffee tastes cheap and burned.  Overall, most of the things you get there feel very cheap and flavorless, kinda like at Midtown except you pay more for it.\n\nAnd one more thing: I'm 6 feet tall, not too abnormal, right? Well, guess what, if you're taller than 5'8, when you sit, your knees are going to be touching the knees of the person in front of you, and don't even try to sit in the booth, because they're made for short people.\n\nI also forgot to mention that they don't have a proper garbage disposal area, so they pile all of their trash on the sidewalk at the end of the day (like 20 big bags of trash), making the whole area smell like trash.\n\nThere are so many cheaper and better quality places to go to in Philly for great brunch. I guess people just don't know any better, so they end up going to dumps like this thinking it's great... kinda like how people from NJ think that Pat's and Geno's is Philly's best cheesesteak.

What a big mistake!!!!  This place has no sense of an organized process for seating.  We were told we would have to wait for 30 minutes.  We decided to stay.  After we saw people in parties of 2 be seated,  my sister questioned where we were on the list.  \n\nThe \"so called\" hostesses seemed to not want to be questioned.  So we gave  it a few more minutes moving into an hour and my sister approached again after seeing people walk in behind us and be seated. \n\nThe rude very annoyed hostess reluctantly let my sister see our name on the list but what I want you the Yelp reader to know is before she showed it she quickly SCRATCHED OUT AN OBVIOUS NEGATIVE DESCRIPTION OF US. This was shocking to me as a visitor from the south, Atlanta.  It went down hill , the Manager couldn't control the hostesses who were catty and really should be washing dishes in the back not dealing with customers.  \n\nAnd as we waited an hour another party of 5 were there when we walked in and we're still standing so if we waited an hour their wait was much longer. So the manager said this process has worked for 8 years. But there is no process that is why it's out of sorts and chaotic.\n\nWhile standing for an hour, the food looked greasy and over the top, so we left and went somewhere where the food and service was excellent.

This is the second time been this amazing food place! However, I had really hard time today with the hostess! The first time in this country I felt so un respected. I came with my husband this morning around 11 am, we just kept waiting till everyone one behind us get a table before us! When we were waiting, this hostess rolled her eyes on me and be annoying face and expression, and I was asking nicely. Guess is just because I am Chinese, she probably have some problem with Chinese , coz my husband asked again who is white  we got a table immediately. However, I walked out the door! Coz this is very hard for me to accept it! \n\n\nYour hostess rolling her eyes on me and the attitude is very rude. \nAnd we were standing in the corner watch so many people behind us get in! When we put our name on your app she said is the only one in the line! We were the first! \nAnd I can understand when you are very busy might forget us! Everyone does it! \nThe most important thing is she rolled her eyes and being mean to me.  The voice and face told me she doesn't like me. Coz how she treat me and other people is different!

The food is fantastic the waitresses and waiters and hostesses are very pleasant.\n\nHowever, recently it appears that the owner will managers have changed the policy on sitting you at your table. My daughter went there to meet a friend for brunch and they will literally three people at the Palantine location sitting down and eating. She asked that she have a table for two The hostess asked if the other person from her party was here and my daughter said she is 5 to 10 minutes away. The hostess said I will have to ask the manager to see if I can seat  you as you may have to wait to your other party gets here. Now, as a reminder there are only three people in the restaurant and there are at least enough to seat 40 people. My daughter said well I will be ordering my food and a drink before my friend gets here because I'm hungry. So  after some discussion and some complaining they finally sat my daughter so she could eat. \nI nursed behind my daughter who is from the U of Pennsylvania just getting off a 12 hour shift was also meeting a friend there and had the same problem.\n\nI went there this morning Christmas Eve with my daughter my son and his daughter and my three grandchildren will literally five minutes away and I asked that we be seated and the girl said that on the weekends we can only sear you when your entire party has arrived.I looked around the restaurant and they were two people sitting at a table in the whole restaurant. I told the girl I'm sitting down and you can get your manager and he or  she can come talk to me if they have a problem. \n\nI can understand during a time when it is busy that you must have your entire party present before being seated. I understand that there are people who will say their party  is on their way and it could be a half hour before they come and if the restaurant is busy that they ask you to wait for your whole party to arrive. \n\nI think the policy do not seat you when the restaurant is mostly empty is ridiculous.  The managers should work with the hostesses and inform them that if the restaurant is half empty or three quarters empty that they should seat the customer right away, whether the whole party is there or not. \n\nThis is supposed to be an upscale caf\u00e9/ restaurant and if it's going to stay that way they should have an upscale attitude on how to treat a customer. We are giving Sabrinas the privilege to serve us.

Twice.\n\nI was unimpressed both times.  There!  I said it!  Overrated. Overpriced.  Totally disappointing.\n\nThe first time I ate here, I had fish tacos.  I sent them back and got some pancakes or something.  Fine.  But I figured why not give this place another chance since everyone goes on and on about it.\n\nI just ate here today with my friend who is a gluten-free vegan.  She picked the restaurant for the record. We each ordered a glass of fresh-squeezed OJ which was delicious.  My friend decided we needed a pitcher of OJ, seeing as we were both drinking it.  Awesome!  The \"pitcher\" was in all actuality a 1/4 carafe!  It was two glasses with about 1/2 cup of juice left.  That was twelve dollars.  Each glass was 3.99.  Um, can you say TOTAL RIP OFF?\n\nMy friend ordered the scrambled tofu, gluten free.  The server came back and informed her that all the tofu had been prepared and that they could not make it without gluten.  Really?  What the hell kind of chefs do you have back there that cannot take a little tofu, add a little seasoning and, I don't know, scramble it?!  So she asked for fruit and home fries because that was all she could get.  She asked for it to be place on one plate, so it looked like a meal, I guess.  They brought it out in two bowls.  Again, this should not have been a difficult request but, for some reason, was.\n\nI ordered a bacon, spinach, and bleu cheese fritata.  It was adequate.  It wasn't great. It wasn't bad.  It was adequate once I salted an peppered it.  OK. \n\nThe only reason this is getting the second star is because the server took the price of the juice off because they could not fulfill my friend's meal request.\n\nDecent service.  Moronic chef.  Overpriced.  Dull.\n\nNext time, will go to Cafe Lift which is not that far away.", "date": "2012-02-29 23:47:18", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "4LMZ9E_gCW-937KqG2NkkA", "name": "Meg", "review_count": 46, "yelping_since": "2010-08-19 19:58:25", "friends": ["xtndc3XyzN3FfUfKCx3WxQ", "HfODoYbSVeCqFOaHQJxqoQ", "OJBQ25hBN7E_YVmHkZceVw", "78E8I7Knyu9Qj6RbHYExIw", "p8h-q7vpsg5g-lXE1mCaiw", "CAmlkIPFTNK4FEsDKCW2Mg", "HwQsqeoGDqTdmsS_2rGcGA", "gE7LxAsTXhgS90VSx8ZVDw", "i2olqx9joDG5X_9dBMGozw", "r0GfhHg_lR4fAxWPrv1dvQ", "US2mFZhQN-dXKpE8-vlHag", "MmqdWXP_vqlNnQSHRuyoYw", "UPDnbvNuhe3wTn3zDSSgew", "vTAlqMYSu0qXSgciFd3jHA", "Zp1o52IRl92dunmsfiT96g", "wD93aQdZ-hhhF9Jory17IA", "kqzkK0l_t3R3Jd-A8dzQ2Q", "aOrU5jt2qm58XoKJkRzEug", "szF1NiVHOuUnU09j5woqnQ", "_RpDEQIESmgjPpHaOtoTrQ", "TyaXiJsDEcHYjxF1FSRjjQ", "PdD4AkokR8REi5PK_7sF7g", "rJkwGolx0itDzha4JbuGrw", "hXl2w75idcEVLZk5vo6YEA", "9IaiiWELCeDGEZgd9B-1Gw", "tLvKK4QvkXmKM32noBF1gg", "OoAym1qKuDixjcqQF2dyqA", "yX364yF3H9FtnVXjZcQXkw", "9IKnV3bq_RQmvFdMTLE0CA", "y9VOxSWIKIXj8jgMHRtWHg", "-FyKU1qiAvVE3U_8C3cJpw", "MmvF7OzJOE2bk65EEvYMAw", "lIqe2JhydWwYOCsW1S2Mdg", "fv-BRM4vDh5mX0msnVszDw", "gSl38dKZL5MXJ2q7Hhj05g", "dSSWnRBPrfYLfsuLSV4sIg", "ILcfea_jMMMl-GWTaTrPUQ", "hlYZgzOxIkuUxbct3LnZoA", "rYvNv0mrlIAjzWN35PWv_Q", "Oc-vMBrH_czADMDP9Fqr_Q", "PyrYy8UoeF4ariE_s2gYkg", "_eD1FqmvcrvxRzVSX58PDg", "nSJR2tg3bSsYsvasjK9KTQ", "9xXnFyxF78JOZpkU02Rffg", "rn7Vh2wkMt8yKDm9QodL_Q", "CMJY8p8jb25FtNaZ8mk0gA", "O7xg4UmB0w3RH3eAgC76mA", "mMVccEESZj9OxGm_snDvnQ", "5hKgay-WXC60fokgT2Q_gg", "brzDKGR8jtDLpdrC-UigDQ", "sPW8kSHj3kcU57Wf320ONQ", "QkHQJOY2wKXx2DR9_5_ODA", "5SxsWcTnRKvgGDrMXkbd3A", "4ze88V1brgv5slnpZ1Q4gw", "ok9_kX4oo5CilAxVAEMDmA", "r1rMN1jEgmxbw6fMTuyHqA", "RgDVC3ZUBqpEe6Y1kPhIpw", "pnuNDfRMb56EbRnSgT83HQ", "VITm9hiVFJAt_qGBQBD3qQ", "nRG8Sw9L_mDimeaMRCiMcA", "sB7CGm4Bq45NPMmdZpiUXQ", "2nLdTJBn7KQGXIEiVBHgIA", "2d0lIZQ5jCCUmbhgwyRNdg"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.59, "fans": 2}}

I am probably going to get a lot of heat for this review, but they're all subjective right?\n\nI have lived in the Spring Garden neighborhood for a year and for a year I have been dying to trying Sabrina's. Everyone I spoke to kept telling me how incredible it was, and how the wait (although insane) was always worth it. \n\nOn a particularly hungover Sunday I decided to arm myself with patience and go stand in line for a big indulgent breakfast. The wait for a table for two was about 45 minutes. The place is small and since it was still chilly outside, most of us were jammed in the entrance. I saw big plates of yummy food coming and going, and the amount of people willing to wait for a table was so crazy that I had no doubt this would be a mind-blowing experience. \n\nWhen we finally sat down the service was fabulous. I am sorry I don't remember the name of the sweet server who helped us, but despite the crowd she was attentive and pleasant. I ordered a bagel with lox, my friend ordered a healthy plate of fruit and granola. Since I wanted to get a better taste of the place, we also ordered a short stack of pancakes. No frills, no healthy stuff, just straight pancakes with lots of butter and syrup. \n\nAlthough the meal wasn't bad per se, it wasn't all that mind-blowing either. I grew up in South Jersey so I am used to diners and (and here is where everyone is going to hate me) I thought Sabrina ranked among the more mediocre Jersey diner I've tried. I don't understand the hype, unless it is simply the lack of a diner in that area. I personally make better pancakes at home, and the line for a table is definitely not worth it. \n\nMaybe I simply chose the wrong menu items, but I am not sure I'll have the patience to wait another 45 minutes on an empty stomach to risk another OK meal. \n\nSorry Sabrina!", "date": "2013-05-07 18:36:30", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "R9sjNOCNvvfprh-AuXah-Q", "name": "Patrizia", "review_count": 117, "yelping_since": "2011-09-10 23:03:36", "friends": ["dqYjJFj_v9HVQMB-Q_5jEQ", "aVmzMj7cum6MOeI2BNC6nQ", "HGRWyUyj-YDe0Ag0fZmUaw", "h_R_n-lNfz39Mt3autxXcg", "gAIt8X0U3sOCY6KS8VsACA", "m1a5bugZbVv35QPwO5HR_A", "4KDgxSGtdxaPCmpuyNleWw", "zN_-yy354adyz5Mzlo4Ukw", "V8_Fyf5MnQ3T8PSHnc9kqA", "azRKGLs_wQyzdaN46Obt4g", "0ENzgR4DD5_nLAgCF3fvbA", "ymi8x7iVdGJOLYmGt51G-A", "EfLoqNi6FRGNVgCeagvV1Q", "KxYagwVik2ZyE4BfmFXTMQ", "QkHQJOY2wKXx2DR9_5_ODA", "fc5lV0_2vIxxHHuODH1vmA", "meZghCLy2BvYQvkBbpPGVg", "JkhfITTIA-Ir2EVz-y3kbg", "eSU_HjKOA3Ppt8oS07oYkw", "oaTMTtkxjuUslocB7KEo7w", "KM3aqyOZUssGsb0Oon6vcg", "GCfKw0ZQGEGyh9sof4zCnA", "aqK8q2z0Ey0XsoQZSTHigw", "EhWNooVCfxTA8bjV31-Lvw", "1N4HNCbMIead4r_22jseHw", "_c6pLyVcatz5vn72qXV1kw", "wQWks-RlAJykwgJzrolKJg", "0qd26JGvl-PJJKaJhsfmEg", "jRrAS-9nugppeGgpo3TQow", "bJO3no73Nsagy4UvAe2Oew", "Uu3COVVmHQpJkPR25exa9Q", "_W19DzuscoaYwdbASLvvSA", "IvYyjnsCUZiJwV06pOuZ0Q", "nSSrvOvPgoankSHO8hEHPQ", "HFN7_fYSbjCrAjXpkgMsnA", "hvoqtbmiadA2lkndD9N0Rg", "PJLzbA6p2brE-jJYJ0fl8w", "db1RROzvTqmq0n0M26GT6Q", "1KvwAFliaLsd3ZSYlEONgw", "SE6JWaIMN79doMsSaSfGHg", "b0frDGh5F03CifdFOUSS_Q", "VEsC22Y5RAdJyWrSfcSoMA", "OBQej2KTU7jNa0pZeZfj2A", "ZgMPte2evdNqPc0DTFLfKQ", "cndpW4OQV2tXy9Ek61u7hQ", "6Kb1i8OrGY5rXpQ8B_FeTQ", "Yjer78RnYr7OCzirgdcOaw", "v7tfkZk_QGBFXy48gX4lWA", "t5hbZXXG4uNj6rYPwRDJvQ", "xZIS0iyY463Pxv9_v8GBTg", "Y1dYFoFc6jLbK5VmjfZ-aQ", "vGExYsUo77MeQn3jg2g4PA", "yczF1cr4KySvkBd6Qq1UsA", "fAJ4v8WKt7DYkC2dskayvQ", "wrhrpCmY8t_0HLQVkAc4vQ", "cbGFv88CvHJsL1LvCbhjgw", "e2_SY1b9Z0IJZFESrGfzDw", "2a8zt_d_qJ4w_59tz0VEuQ", "_hPjqzQDiyw1-4U_IAETpg", "IOlfsCGE0m2lcy_OuD5URA", "A9Y1qx-zys5-Yj0JPBjeSg", "Ibu7ZjV_apr6531-jUthuA", "oadDHXeD2ABvGer29TYfYw", "W1es56xEG9oPx44o_0Xa1A", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "F_x9TNxEAz_umpScVnXIJA", "8MrHNUT0QBpD5vHxn1rD2w", "NLqQO1-l_IAQUV7b-nsUfg", "slpyLHWsvPXwj1XPoyjugQ", "yDde733wJSxV3hdmnJw7mw", "B0LOdLRfR2YHpmgpv0i_Xw", "QzMheZJOHNfdakBaKlG3eQ", "PYJb9utnqbhnAo2j8blHjA", "qHLadJanmQvLfRcafeB-IQ", "Lb-0y35-vafOkfd9YBWXLA", "CbuZT7eOiOIKZIPRQqGxag", "eX75zO_C8qUovUIpf83aAw", "WZq-zBqe_L8uhVkUQ_RMDQ", "bWXYrsGqwwcXzY3UaypCHg", "uFKzRT5dYprcMmC2P3Chvg", "UiRx8jyS6H957ItwFsP2nQ", "vp-rUwRINLc0DREQbMi8kQ", "T8KoXDnYzWZv7-YZD2EyRw", "I24YvlYw1n4r7u0e79XfFQ", "_Iy_yDV3vEwlaluW0802wg", "Vv921iDdazUHJqPCBzJnUQ"], "elite": ["2013", "2014", "2015", "2016"], "average_stars": 3.37, "fans": 13}}

Service was great, however the food I received was subpar. We were seated late after joining wait-list online (45-50 min). We checked in at the door and waited for additional 30 min. We were told that we would get a text when our table was ready. After 30 min, decided to check with the hostess who realized we had been waiting for so long, to seat us..she explained there was technical issues and that's why we didn't get a text. Fine, at least we were seated right away when we flagged it. I ordered the tots dish. It could be me but all the online reviews of the dish didn't mention it was going to be a soupy dish (looks like it's from the veggies. Couldn't they have drained some of the broth before serving? It also makes the tots soggy. I tried it to push through despite the fact that it was a soup underneath the eggs (where the veggies laid), but just couldn't. If the flavor was there .. it could have helped the soupy dish, but it tasted pretty bland. The execution of the dish was a miss for me. I alerted the waitress and she indicated it was soupy and then immediately took care of asking if I wanted something else which I ordered the Nova lox bagel ( simple dish). She rushed the order which I appreciated. This Nova lox bagel dish was ok. It came out sloppy looking. Not sure if kitchen staff was overwhelmed and just trying to get orders out, but I knew at this point, the experience was dismal due to 2 disappointing dishes.\nI wish I had taken a picture of the tots dish to show how soupy it is to just alert anyone who may be interested in ordering. Be aware that there is at least 2-3 inches of broth underneath the eggs and tots.", "date": "2019-07-28 18:30:33", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "JuGUyTHXe7nbjoOv7cl6AQ", "name": "Lulu", "review_count": 7, "yelping_since": "2015-10-01 23:26:43", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.86, "fans": 0}}

Nine people walked in at around 9 pm; there was plenty of room, but all kind of interspersed through out the place so the staff decided to combine three tables into a weird L-shaped design which seemed like it would be an awkward dining experience but it worked well for the most part.\n\n2. The aforementioned staff are very friendly, going so far as to joke with individual friends in the group about various things that I wasn't paying attention to because I was so hungry. Also, BYO. Just thought of that.\n\n3. I was kind of confused as to why there were two menus that were handed to us. It was explained to me but now I can't remember. Brunch was not an option when I was there, but it looks absolutely amazing based on the pictures that others have put up so I will definitely be going back to try something else at a brunch-friendly hour.\n\n4. The food: I got some Mediterranean chicken sandwich doohickey. It was good. I was recommended the sweet potato fries. Not a fan. The first few bites were good but after a while, my brain/mouth was confused because they look like fries but taste like dessert, and it was just not a pleasant experience; I actually started getting sick of them and left a large portion uneaten. I thought that I should have gone with the parmesan fries and pilfered some from a friend's plate. Surprisingly they were even less impressive. I tried a friend's sweet potato mashed potatoes (that's kind of redundant) and what little I tried I enjoyed but I'm assuming the same problem with the sweet potato fries would happen if I had gotten that. Everyone's food looked amazing and I have a fair idea of some other things to try the next time I'm there. As of now though, I'm only moderately impressed with what I had. \n\n5. Also, maybe it's just me but why do some people just assume that when a large group of people is present and it's time to pay that the best thing to do is just combine the bill? That's just laziness. The bill comes to something like a $120+, and you thought that only one of us is going to pick up the tab for your convenience? And it's really frustrating thereafter to deal with the mess of calculating how much everyone's meal is and then hand the waitress 8 credit cards and some cash. Just split the damn bill. It's not that hard to do and it saves so much time and frustration. Not to mention, I'm less likely to stiff you on a proper tip if I'm not annoyed. Otherwise, you're going to get whatever was calculated by my friends (because I am not the math whiz in the group).", "date": "2010-06-21 15:16:34", "useful": 5, "funny": 2, "cool": 4, "user":

While potentially influenced by the challenge in transporting brunch items, there was just too much inconsistency in the food. I would lean towards lunch over breakfast on a return visit.\n\nQuality: Breakfast foods are not always the best for take-out, but we took a chance with Sabrina's Cafe anyway. And while I am sure eating things immediately would have helped the quality, there was clearly some inconsistencies with the food. I started with a slice of the Avocado Toast, and I felt the thick multigrain bread was a very wrong choice to be used. The Huevos Rancheros were hurt by some delay sogginess, but the overall flavor was good. The Tots were interesting, but an extremely heavy item. The bites I had of the two sandwiches were my favorites, with the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich slightly beating out Mel's Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. And the Cannoli French Toast, which I expected to be my favorite item, proved to be way too much in terms of sweetness.\nQuantity: Huge portions and we ordered a lot of food. Expect a single entree to fill up even the hungriest of diner.\nValue: $10 for the Avocado Toast. $13 for the Huevos Rancheros. $13 for The Tots. $13 for Mel's Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. $13 for the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. $11 for the Cannoli French Toast. \nAmbiance: Sabrina's Cafe has several locations around Philadelphia, but we picked up from the one near the museums. They had a small table out front along the steps, which was set up to take names and to help with take-out. I did not step inside, but it looked like they had a large indoor dining space, though it had restricted capacity. In an alley along the side of the building, not even directly adjacent to the restaurant, they had set up a nice outdoor area. I assume it is only temporary, but it looked great and much more appealing than what I saw of inside.\nCrowd: We ordered our meal to-go, but most guests were dining-in, both indoor and outdoor. There was a 20 minute wait for Saturday brunch, and I assume that was actually light for the weekend.\nService: The staff was super helpful and even though our order was large and the restaurant was busy, the estimated time was spot on. \nParking: Street parking out front and a large parking lot less than a block away.", "date": "2020-10-28 23:21:22", "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user":

She really knows me, because paired with a runny egg, there is little I enjoy more.  Sabrina's style of scrapple is not my favorite; this one is much more brown with a more dense pack of corn meal than I prefer.  Along with being sliced thinly, to me, it loses some of the good flavor of the pig parts.  It was still good, for sure, but the coating overpowers the innards.\n\nBeyond that, which I fully appreciate is nit-picky, the meal was good.  I like the unchanged lunch counter/diner layout and the staff is young and fast.  Everyone was friendly, but busy, and our \"15-20 minute wait\" evaporated when I asked to sit at the bar.  \n\nIn terms of portions: I could definitely spend the same amount of money - mine was $6.29 for eggs, potatoes, and toast - and get less food.  If I got 2 slices of bread, instead of 4, and half the homies (which are great) I would still feel like I got my money's worth.  If they had eggs on the a la cart menu I would have skipped the starches today.  The scapple add-on was just under $3 for two 3x5 pieces.  A very good deal.\n\nAll-in-all this is a good place to go.\n\nShe Said: Whenever we visit a new city, my guy and I look for a good breakfast place, and I had high expectations for this place due to the reviews. We arrived early-ish on a Saturday (9:30am), and we were seated almost immediately at the bar. I asked for English Breakfast tea, and the water was hot enough that the tea was not bitter, so that was good. I thought about the eggs benedict, but I didn't want a whole lot of food. I opted for one of the egg sandwiches. Scrambled eggs, cheddar, and bacon on whole grain toast with homies. First, the homies were great. No need to ask for them extra crispy--they came that way anyway. They also weren't pre-salted which was nice. The eggs were fine, but dry. The toast was fine, but dry. The bacon was fine, but skimpy.\n\nAll in all, the food was average. The tea was great. The company was awesome. The ambiance was fine. According to Yelp, three stars mean it's A-Ok, which it was. But I won't need to go back any time soon.\n\nPotty Points: I didn't visit the bathroom here, so I can't offer any points!", "date": "2016-06-19 01:43:44", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "OzDBhkyKgY1iVB2umJiMTA", "name": "He Said She Said", "review_count": 114, "yelping_since": "2014-09-22 04:02:07", "friends": ["xi2Y9p80Vdku0zg75ZK1Lg", "FUe96nh_igQ1-4XlJxFSrA", "BxcS6tYaQwykzBm0heozXw", "0bQdh3MkOJiU05YteGzb-Q", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "d9AtV5iJ8HZQysUlh3Ryiw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 5}}

Brunch is usually associated with the weekend and a gab fest a la Sex and the City. And the wonderful thing about brunch is there are only so many ways to cook eggs, pancakes, French toast, and waffles, which means it's pretty difficult for the chef to really mess it up. But that also means there's a small margin of error. The line between average fare and something more interesting / spectacular is therefore very fine. \n\nNow onto Sabrina's. Everyone and their moms talk up Sabrina's like it's Philadelphia's answer to brunch, when in fact Sabrina's notoriety is gained due to the sad void of competing bruncheries, especially in the center city / callowhill area. So, after a year in Philadelphia, I've realized that Sabrina'a gets its reputation for \"best brunch ever\" by default. I find the food at Sabrina's to be pretty pedestrian, and not really deserving of the title of best brunch ever. But of course it's still vastly superior to IHoP or Denny's. \n\nI've been to Sabrina's twice. The first time I had the stuffed French toast. I admit that I should have paid better attention to the menu description and asked for the maple syrup on the side instead of it getting drizzled directly onto a dish which I felt was sweet enough. It was my first time eating stuffed French toast and I just wasn't a fan. My friends ordered a sandwich with the Parmesan fries, a stuffed French toast with strawberries, and eggs benedict (or some sort of poached egg). Well, I've never met a potato I didn't like so I do like the home fries. And I love that the coffee comes in these homestyle mugs so you kinda feel like you're just eating brunch at a friend's. Which is a facade the servers keep up with their friendly service.\n\nThe second time I went, I got the breakfast burrito, and it was just a little too dry for me. But the service is consistently friendly. \n\nOverall, Sabrina's is decent but not worth the long wait on the weekends. I just wish people would stop overhyping this place.", "date": "2010-10-07 18:19:27", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "s6RyTlSZAbb6Leknlly3-A", "name": "Karen", "review_count":

This local restaurant chain was recommended to us by three separate friends as one of Philadelphia's best spots for breakfast and brunch (they serve lunch and dinner too). The food was good and service was great. While I don't think this place is *significantly* better than other popular and highly-regarded brunch restaurants I've tried, it's still definitely worth checking out if you want American breakfast/brunch comfort food. The food is delicious, though heavy, and the portions are huge and filling.\n\nThere are five Sabrina's locations in the Delaware Valley including three in Philly proper. This location is the second and it opened in 2007 (the first opened in 2001). Sabrina's is named after the owners' daughter. This particular location has \"and Spencer's Too\" in the name because of the owners' son, who was born later. We chose to dine at this location because it was close to our hotel, the Philadelphia 201, which is only a couple blocks away; a short walk. If you're staying at this hotel or anywhere nearby, I do recommend Sabrina's for breakfast/brunch.\n\nI heard this place gets packed with waits the norm. We showed up bright and early on a Monday morning just before opening (8am). A small crowd had already built up on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. When the doors opened, all of us were seated immediately. This place has plenty of space. It has a diner feel to it. You can sit at the counter with its cushioned and pattern-upholstered chairs or at one of the numerous small tables or booths. The atmosphere is casual and homey. There's a tiled coffee bar and lampshades with floral designs.\n\nDuring our visit, the large blackboard menu on the dining room's center wall featured chalk drawings of Sonic and Knuckles (random). Specials included chicken and waffles ($14.95) and dinner entrees like seafood scampi ($15.95) and goat cheese penne pasta ($14.95). We also received a seasonal drink menu and monthly food specials.\n\nSabrina's signature breakfast items are the huevos rancheros ($11.79), stuffed challah French toast ($11.99), and \"The Tots\" ($12.59). Other breakfast/brunch foods include eggs, frittatas, omelettes, pancakes, bagels and lox, housemade granola, avocado toast, and a quinoa bowl. Most of these other items cost about the same or less than the signature items. Most non-breakfast/brunch food includes soups and salads and burgers and sandwiches. Expect to spend about $11-13 each for those items. They have a kids menu too. Beverage-wise, they offer coffee and espresso-based drinks, teas, fresh juices, and Jones brand \"craft\" soda.\n\nWe ordered two signature items and a couple seasonal drinks:\n\n* Stuffed Challah French Toast ($11.99) with farmer's cream cheese topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup\n* The Tots ($12.59) - fried panko-encrusted tater tots topped with grilled hot sausage hash; caramelized onions, bell peppers, and fennel seed; topped with basil chimichurri, sour cream, and over-easy eggs\n* Cookie Butter Iced Mocha ($4.79) - cookie butter, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n* Iced Strawberry Mocha ($4.79) - strawberry, dark chocolate, espresso, and milk\n\nThe food was great. I preferred the Stuffed Challah French Toast over The Tots, but I could change my mind given the day. The French toast was outstanding. The best thing about it to me was the filling: farmer's cream cheese. I'm a cream cheese fan in general, but this particular cream cheese was lighter and less dense than your typical American cream cheese. Its silky smooth texture trended towards whipped cream. Overall, wonderful flavor when combined with the vanilla bean syrup (I love vanilla). Ripe slices of banana and a bit of cinnamon and powdered sugar were thrown on top. The consistency of the French toast itself was soft, springy, and appetizing. I recommend this dish.\n\nThe Tots was heavy, but satisfying. It's a lot of food packed into a medium-sized bowl. The panko-encrusted tater tots were bigger than average tots. They were like tots on steroids. The ingredients, particularly the hot sausage hash and the over-easy eggs, came out temperature hot from the kitchen. I had to wait for the bowl to cool down a bit. This one was a savory, greasy smorgasbord of textures and flavors. I had the tots with ketchup and ate the rest of the dish with various hot sauces at the table (Cholula, Frank's RedHot, Sriracha). If you have a ravenous appetite, The Tots is for you; it's packed with lots of carbs and protein.\n\nThe iced mochas were good. They were expectedly sweet; almost too sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth). I liked the Cookie Butter Iced Mocha better than the Strawberry. Both drinks were rich, flavorful, and refreshing. The dark chocolate flavor was strong. If you order these, you might ask if you can adjust the sweetness.\n\nPatricia was our server and she was attentive and sweet. The hostess was nice too.\n\nI'd come back.", "date": "2019-10-27 13:04:13", "useful": 8, "funny": 0, "cool": 4, "user": {"user_id": "j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "name": "Daniel", "review_count": 4333,

Sabrina's Cafe is a popular (as in, during summer, it's an often sight to see the Sunday brunch crowds line up outside!) series of establishments in Philadelphia, specializing in big, enormous portions for the average hungry Jane/Joe, friendly staff, and cozy atmosphere enjoying classics most people are accustomed to, with their own twist, such as burgers, platters, pancakes/French toast, salads, and breakfast/lunch fare, to name a few. I haven't had a chance to enjoy their vegan/vegetarian items, but from testimonials from guests I dine with here, they're the best, and brings out the flavor they've been seeking, and can even substitute some items. There's five (5) locations, including this one close by to Philly's museums and the heart of downtown, the \"main\"/flagship/first location in Italian Market, another one in University City close to Penn U, one outside of Philly in the suburbs of Wynnewood, and a location in Collingswood, NJ, catering to those who would love to have a good meal. For those interested, they allow for BYOB, just make sure it's solely wine/beer/alcoholic beverage only, and be responsible! They're also wonderful handling kids menus, although a few offerings \"seem\" to be a bit over the top for a child.\n\nI've visited on many different occasions to the three Sabrina Cafe's in Philly, especially this location, so let's begin, and I'll base my review on my latest visit to make things relevant! Decided to visit on one of their quiet moments vs the bustling weekend, and I've made a reservation to make sure I can sit down and enjoy some of their best offerings. As what other Yelpers would allude to, portions are huge! If you're coming from a lengthy trip (in my case, near NYC), the first thing that comes to mind is to fill up on some morning delights. Starred off with a bowl of granola and fruit, it's satisfactory, can help get your morning started with some fresh fruit and a balanced breakfast. While waiting in between dishes, I've took a gander at the restaurant and paced around to convey other people's opinions: most were delighted to be there, loved the scenery, and of course, the chalk art is something to look forward to every visit. Ordered something \"simple\" in my books, a challah French toast, plus strawberries, since at the end of the day, you'll be thankful later to top it up with toppings, whether it's a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit (depends on the time of the year), marshmallows, bacon (not for me), and more instead of facing \"plain\" French toast, nothing wrong, but \"berry\" good to put Tuesday cheer! Digging in to those thick, huge slices of French toast, it's bringing me back to those carefree days where I've first arrived here - and the feeling was the same: soft, fluffy French toast inside, slight crunch on the crust, and ample amount of maple syrup. It left me at 110% satisfaction, and if time allowed, I would've ordered more. Delighted with my food and finely brewed latte, I've gave my waitress a generous thank you, and parted ways to continue my day. : ) A general wrap up, but their \"signature\" item in my mind would be the Stuffed Challah French toast, which perfectly captures the balance between bananas, honey, and cream cheese (it's Philly after all...), and seems to \"bigger\" than French toast, and pancakes are another option if you'd love to, I usually request banana or chocolate chips (premium).\n\nIn short, this is the premier brunch (or breakfast in this case) spot in Philly I would go to to unwind. Weekends, the crowd triples (or in summer, quintuples) in size, and it's a common sight to wait ~30min+ without careful planning, and service, as with other places, would be sluggish at best. Distance may be an issue in my books, but it's delighted Philly residents far and wide, and I'll definitely return!

This is also supposed to be one of the top brunches in town. \n\nWe needed a tasty brunch/breakfast before we started off our Art Museum Sunday so we decided on this place. It was packed which I believe is the norm. Luckily we only had to wait for 15-20 minutes for a table(totally acceptable). As we were leaving there was a huge crowd that had gathered outside. Much of our Philly trip had those results. Apparently we were the trendsetters arriving before everyone else. \n\nSabrina's takes advantage of all of their space. There are some 2 person tables packed tightly together which makes it difficult for patrons and staff to get through. I'd advise not going with a large group. You might get lucky, but it doesn't seem like a great place to put tables together.\n\nThey have breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner options. There were quite a few things that I immediately wanted as soon as I opened the menu!\n\nI probably should've ordered something sweet but I decided to pick something off their July 4th menu. It was August 7th and they still had that menu! I'm not sure if they call it July 4th menu or if they keep it around through the summer. \n\nI chose John Hancock's Sign Me Up For That Special Breakfast. This dish consisted of blueberry cornbread(stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto), scrambled eggs, arugula, crispy bacon, and cauliflower white cheddar sauce. The cornbread was good but too dry. The white cheddar sauce did help some, but not much. The menu also said it was stuffed with red pepper ricotta pesto... um, no it wasn't! I love arugula but I don't think I've ever mixed it with eggs. The scrambled eggs with arugula and cauliflower white cheddar sauce... go ahead and give me two dozen of them on a second plate! Delicious! Bacon is like bacon everywhere. It's bacon. It's either crispy, crunchy, fatty, on a doughnut, or even peanut buttery... wait, I need to stop before this becomes a Butterfinger commercial(Extra kudos if you get the reference).\n\nThe dish also came with their fried potatoes. Can we just take a moment to appreciate a place that knows the difference between a fried potato and a fry? Most places like this try to call fried potatoes what they're not(fries). Fried potatoes are obviously different than fries! Kudos to Sabrina's for that. I also added peppers to my FRIED POTATOES... great choice!\n\nI took off one star because it is a cramped space. If you need a nice quiet meal away from people or you're anti-social, then definitely don't go here. That one star off is also because it's not the best brunch I've tried. It was delicious. I didn't get the WOW factor from this place.\n\nI want to make it back for that Barking Chihuahua dish along with a dozen other things they have!", "date": "2016-08-17 17:06:43", "useful": 0, "funny":

I love to come here for any meal.  No matter what you always get a fantastic meal!  \n\nMostly, I come for breakfast/brunch!\n\nHuevo's Rancheros is one of my favorite dishes and is usually my go to when I am here for a breakfast item.  I also like the barking Chihuahua when I am feeling very hungry!  Their frittatas are also excellent.  My favorite is the egg white turkey bacon frittata.  Its is a good option if you want a bit of a healthier type breakfast, with no loss of flavor! \n\nI like to come here with my sister and young nephew.  The place isn't bad for kids.  My nephew loves the pancakes and French toast. (He also loves their French fries!)\n\nTheir fruit is always super fresh too, which I love.\n\nFor lunch, I like to get either the Mel's Chicken cutlet (so drool worthy), the Tuscan chicken sandwich, or the Mediterranean wrap.  Everything is different and so flavorful.  Portions are pretty big, so whenever I come with my mom, we often share!\n\nTheir salads are also excellent.  Very often I will split a salad and sandwich with someone I am with, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.\n\nThey do themed brunches too, which is such a great novelty!  Special menu's are available for these with cute puns as all of the menu item names.\n\nThey don't serve dinner at all of their locations, but I highly suggest checking the places that do serve dinner out.  Fantastic meal!  Our go-to's are the octopus and calamari as a starter.  Always a good pick!  If we want something a bit lighter, we go for the hummus.\n\nThe dishes I have had as my main course are the Grilled Orange Ginger Pork Chop, The Honey Melon Glazed Salmon, and the Smokey Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna.  You cannot go wrong with either.  Portions are also pretty big, so make sure you are hungry!!\n\n\nI also really like that this restaurant has plenty of vegentarian and vegan options.   I myself am a carnivore, but I do also enjoy the vegetarian options and have many vegan/vegetarian friends.   It is really nice to have plenty of choices and a variety in the menu which Sabrin'a certainly provides.\n\nThe prices here are pretty reasonable.  The only downside here, is the wait, especially on the weekends. Plus they can get crazy crowded and the space is pretty tight and can get pretty loud. However, I guess that is part of what makes Sabrina's so special.  Also, not a bad place for kids!Certainly worth a wait for the food, staff is always friendly and accommodating!  Great for smaller groups, but since space is on the tighter side, I wouldn't go in a group larger than 6.\n\nSabrina's is a great, casual, fun place to eat, I suggest you go and enjoy!", "date":

Owners Robert and Raquel DeAbreu named the original restaurant on 9th and Christian Streets after their daughter. Recently, for Memorial Day brunch, the GF, our friend, and I went to the second location, which includes the name of their son.\n\nAnd based on the success of these two joints, a third location in University City, by Drexel campus, was opened last year. The inside of Sabrina's Cafe & Spencer's Too is highly reminiscent of a neighborhood cafe/diner. Offering a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, with the occasional snarky, yet fun waitress, it's one of our favorite places to grab brunch.\n\nAnd being that Sabrina's is BYO, our friend brought some champagne along to pair with a pitcher of OJ. And yes, as expected with most BYO's, the markup on the pitcher of OJ is around 400%.\n\nBut back to the good. Sabrina's is great in that they have an ever changing menu of specials. Arrested Development aficionados known that Michael Bluth and company are back in action. So natch, Sabrina's had a bevy of 'Arrested' brunch specials. Creative, whimsical, and most importantly delicious, what's not to love? \n \nBut on this particular outing, we decided to get all of the 'signature' breakfast items.\n\nHuevos Rancheros ($10.99)\n2 blue corn tortillas, smoky chorizo sausage sauce, lime sour cream, spicy guacamole, 2 fried eggs, fried jalapeno pepper\n\nI opted for the huevos rancheros - a nice medley of different flavors, all highlighted by the bright lime sour cream. The fried eggs and chorizo sausage sauce helped to create a hearty dish, with the blue corn tortillas offering some fried texture. The guacamole was nice, but not particularly spicy, though the fried jalapeno pepper had a tempered heat that was nice to add to each bite. The accompanying home fries were crispy on the outside and creamy inside. \nPerfectly seasoned, I could eat these by the ton.\n\nBarking Chihuahua ($8.99)\nFlour tortilla, scrambled eggs, black beans, red peppers, pepper jack cheese, sour cream, marinara\n\nThe GF and our friend both got the barking chihuaha, which amounts to Sabrina's breakfast burrito. A nice iteration of this oft-seen dish, the flour tortilla had a nice grilled texture to it and contained a humongous allowance of perfectly scrambled eggs, black beans, and red peppers. The piquancy of the pepper jack helped to brighten up the dish, with the sour cream and sweet marinara adding creaminess. The fried corn chip strips helped to add additional texture to the dish. A pat of home fries accompanies the burrito as well.\n\nStuffed Challah French Toast (1/2 order $5.50; full order $9.99)\nFarmer's cream cheese, bananas, vanilla bean syrup\n\nPro tip: No matter what, get a half order of the stuffed challah french toast. If the previous two dishes were signature Sabrina's, this is their crown jewel. Not listed on the menu as a half-order option, our waitress knew that we were clearly veterans of the establishment just from this order alone. The french toast is humongous, with a nice grilled exterior and a creamy, eggy interior. This all houses a cinnamon cream cheese that is intensely sweet, yet you just can't stop with one bite. The vanilla bean syrup and fresh banana slices brings this over the top. Definitely a perfect way to end brunch.\n\nWant another tip? On weekends, Sabrina's is packed, so expect to wait at least an hour for a table. So what's a hungry bruncher to do? Call ahead by about an hour and ask to have your name put down. That way you can stroll over when it's about time for your name to be called and you won't have to wait with the rest of the sheep on Callowhill. \n\nFrankly, Sabrina's is a great place to go for any meal - not just brunch. The prices are affordable, the portions are generous, and the food is tasty. What's not to love with this Philly institution? And an added bonus? Their brother restaurant is Spencer ETA - so you know their burgers are on point too!", "date": "2013-05-29 01:36:48", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw",

Ain't NOBODY got time to wait so I used yelp's app to add myself to the list about an hour before patronization. Due to poor time planning and poor winter street hygiene, I almost broke my fucking neck slipping and sliding while rushing here to grab my table the day after our first legit snowstorm of the year. All's well that end's well.\n\nI did make it in the nick of time. We were seated expediently once all members of my party arrived with wine and champagne in tow(aka me, no I'm kidding I was meeting other people...really tho..) in a booth in the far corner. \n\nOne of the best things about this place is not only the ridiculous variety of the menu but the ability to make many items vegetarian. So many fucking things jumped right off of the page, stuffed challah french toast with cream cheese, bananas, and honey topped with bananas  and vanilla bean syrup OR the ultimate mexi scramble with scrambled eggs, pepper jack, bell peppers, tomatoes, BLACK BEAN GRITS, cilantro PESTO, corn chips and avocado as two examples. Ultimately I had to decide and my decision was the classic: HUEVOS RANCHEROS, vegetarian variety. \n\nSo this place is BYOB. We brought some champs and ordered a large jug of OJ. We also brought something else but I don't remember what it was considering we had finished powering through the champagne. \n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time. I'm the breed of idiot that continues to make the same mistake over and over again, one of these mistakes I continuously make is forgetting to order hot suace with my meal. I struggled to flag down a staff-member as they feverishly ran by our table attending to some other shit of another table. Finally I caught someone's attention and managed to obtain a cholula for the table. This place doesn't only have bullshit tabasco, cholula and sriracha are other available options if you enjoy a side of burn-your-fucking-mouth-off as much as I.\n\nThe huevos rancheros were really a work of art, a thing of beauty. I got an above-average number of instagram likes for my photo of this bad boy. Let me walk you through this masterpiece from top to bottom: \n-hot pepper cooked somehow\n-tomato salsa with white cheese shreds\n-guac\n-scrambled eggs (I'm not particularly keen on the standard over-easy on HR)\n-scramble of black beans and vegetarian sausage (they may be part of the scrambled eggs but I cannot tell for certain)\n-tomato sauce\n-hard tortilla shell\n-home-fried potatoes\n\nPlease refer to the photo for more information. All in all this was absolutely spectacular. One of the best brunches I've had in Philly so far. I ate the entire thing. I'm salivating at the thought of it right now. \n\nOne of my eating companions also ordered whole-wheat cinnamon pancakes which I was happy to offer to help consume. They were a touch dry but flavored wonderfully. Syrup improved the dryness. \n\nNeedless to say I was absolutely jam-packed with food in my GI tract at the end of this meal. Even the slightest of movement was torture. It probably saved me some cheddar at whole foods becacuse I could barely look at anything on the shelves. \n\nAll in all this place is a fucking gem and a must visit.", "date": "2018-01-30 21:49:14",

So did I!\n\nI've been a long-time dedicated fan of Sabrina's Cafe at Powelton. I was disappointed that my first time stopping this particular one couple months ago ended with disappointment when I was told the wait was 1 hour. \n\nIf you want to skip my extended review, here's the only thing I want you to take away: a little secret - they don't take reservations, but they do take call ahead seating. TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS! This allowed me to reduce my wait down to 5 minutes, and everything worked so smoothly without us needing to wait. Otherwise, expect to wait 45+ min!\n\nFOOD: 5/5\n\nAlice Cooper's \"School's Out For Summer\"  Breakfast Special: Quite the proper description for me, given that school's out for summer! I loved the banana bread french toast. To be honest, I spent most of my time picking for my parents, so I didn't really read the description of what I ordered other than its awesome name. The banana bread was quite the surprise. The sweetness of the bread and maple gravy definitely stood out among the savory and salty egg scramble, but it was the perfect balance. The portions were huge!\n\nG. Love's \"Rhyme for the Summertime\" Egg White Omelette: My mom is quite health conscious after discovering that her cholestrol level was a bit too high a couple years ago. I recommended this since it was all egg white. I'm personally all about the egg yolk, but this was well prepared. The omelette was so tender, and the marscapone cheese was a great addition!\n\nSublime's \"Doin' Time (Summertime)\" Mexi Special: Hailing from Southern California, my dad absolutely loves anything that has a \"Mexi\"-style attached to it, especially when it comes with avocado. The food itself was a bit too messy for my liking. Everything seemed to be a mountain piled on top of fried tortilla bread, so that was a bit difficult, and thus disappointing, to eat. The avocado tasted fresh, and rice was well seasoned. \n\nSERVICE: 5/5\n\nAs mentioned above, take full advantage of the call-ahead seating! I promise that you'll come in happier. The waiter we had was super friendly and helpful. She helped clarify all the questions I had, allowed me to have the rice to be served on the side (Dad doesn't like onions which was in the rice), and made sure the egg white omelette my mom had didn't get messed up because it was golden yellow on the outside. My only negative feedback wasn't from this one experience, but the time before. When I was told the wait was going to be 1+ hour, I was treated quite poorly and felt like I was being pushed out the door. I'm glad that wasn't the case this time.\n\nOverall, this place is my favorite brunch place in Philadelphia! If you're too full from the huge serving, take a nice stroll along the Parkway, and consider enjoying all the wonderful attractions around - Barne's Foundation, the Basilica, Rodin Museum, Philadelphia Art Museum, City Hall, Love Park and Schuylkill River!", "date": "2013-07-01 03:11:48", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "Xaa12Zr3gzCvT9-8UAljZQ", "name": "Larry",

At first look, you'll think the place is too crowded to be at all comfortable, but once you're in and seated, you'll feel comfortable even as the wait staff move about quickly and confidently without bumping into anyone and the customers come and go with ease.\n\nThe place may be small, but the portions are HUGE! Big plates, big salads, big sandwiches, gigantic fries. If you're a person who enjoys super-sizing, without the extra cost, here's your place. \n\nAnd not only super-sized, but super-fresh! My 2 lunch mates both ordered the Greek Salad -- one with chicken, one without. The salads came with 8 pita wedges as big as the palm of my hand, a generous dollop of humus, and all the usual salad components: 2 or 3 kinds of salad greens, cherry tomatoes, green pepper slices, feta cheese...onions(?) All this was crisp and fresh; the pita was soft, airy, and slightly buttery.\n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Philly Cheese Steak with the Polenta Cheddar Jalapeno Fries. It's always a gamble when ordering a veggie steak, since I'm not a vegetarian and the taste is always lacking compared to a thick and meaty traditional steak sandwich, but I was curious to see how Sabrina's did it. The steak chunks were browned seitan. The flavor and texture were so right, somehow, that it just didn't matter. In short: it wasn't meat, but the satisfaction was the same! \n\nThe polenta fries looked like mini loaves of cornbread, they were that large. They looked as though they'd been deep fried, but tasted like they'd been baked. The flavor and the airy disintegration once in your mouth was heavenly. The cheddar, the jalapeno, and corn (polenta) tastes were blended so artfully that no single flavor dominated, but all were distinguished and equally evident.\n\nThe wait staff's timing was perfect. They appeared out of nowhere at just the right moments; our waiter was attentive enough and sincere enough to answer our questions about his hebrew-letters tattoo, even though the restaurant was obviously in the very busy lunch mode.\n\nFor the three large plates (as big as my head!) and three non-alcoholic drinks, the bill came to $40.70, including tax. My veggie cheesesteak and polenta fries came to around $12.50.\n\nFor satisfaction, service, and size, you'll be livin' large at Sabrina's...without the need for any large bills!  :o)", "date": "2008-07-12 23:02:07", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "_z-wqL-DUEQXO9Atdxohjg", "name": "Jeff", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2007-08-03 14:09:42", "friends": ["PTuedEpLlBo4gobyOfwlMg", "rgwJZJYa7P7lWl9mUticUA", "l-kgpRYdSuvePHud8ddWdg", "F_JIJTxZvpEmDBcyjOT5Aw", "y8aWXOimQ9ZgUgZ6q--nCQ", "S4Zd1GTxV8vEhKLweyJXLg", "6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ", "GQIZkWPFICAvxPcJp7JF3g", "6VPXPnoF97T8EIq_9DW3qQ", "MO6UMhtmBwvMzcccXoDhnQ", "FRHkaJY9laMRbPKs1FjSig", "_TH08twdA979fZ0vOPOoXA", "PuWENSFHatDsq-9YdJaMIQ", "k2_aubz7wir6z2S3V2o2jQ", "Vgk5Cnye-wjiSMGDBKoK9w", "wvbtiC17tkww6SKDjvm4jw", "JMY167Dcm-SjBdo9k86bxw", "-eY1Z4TMih6vVLynUxaEEg", "Qxmdj9tN8yrPRe6ncTU0lg", "1f1lGvDGoCiXhqlsMr1VFA", "OcXsqVqcfkwngCkI0csZ2w", "O2ION72ezaJEg22roOGjQw", "1MwoiUajN2l54d4K9uTycA", "CTuRoNPZKkI-DcF_hanb6g"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.75, "fans": 2}}

However,  I went here over the weekend with my boyfriend. while we were there he started feeling very bad (he ended up having the flu). He tried using the bathroom but it was locked. He had to basically run from the back to the front of the restaurant to make it out the front door. He got sick right outside. He was extremely embarrassed but did not have any other options. A woman who worked there proceeded to walk out and yell at him as if he did it on purpose. He was so mortified that he just left. After a text from him, I asked for the check and headed to checkout. This is where I headed to the register to find the entire staff laughing at his expense. when I let them know that I was with him the woman ringing me up said- \"well why didn't he try to go into the bathroom?\" I let her know that it wasnt' available. Another girl even implied that he did it on purpose. I was then asked by my server \"well I hope last night was fun, was it worth it?\" - I let the entire staff know that he was not in fact, hungover, but actually quite sick. Although it was embarrassing for the both of us, and inconvenient for the restaurant, they are in the hospitality industry and probably shouldn't have yelled at one of their customers for being sick. They also shouldn't have assumed that he was drunk/hungover. And speaking about him infront of everyone, not knowing that I was with him was extremely rude.\n\nI have always raved about this place. But i am so put off by their behavior over the weekend that I wont be returning and don't intend on ever telling anyone else to go here. while I do apologize to them for the unfortunate incident that happened at the restaurant, I do believe that their behavior was absolutely unacceptable.", "date": "2010-01-17 17:05:05", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "E04a9wpbv13nC9gQQ3QaDQ", "name": "Kristen", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2010-01-17 16:52:30", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.13, "fans": 0}}

I've tried Ant's Pants Cafe twice and had similar experiences. \n\nThe menu items are simple but seem to exceed their capabilities. \n\nAfter a long wait, and with very few customers to tend to, both meals were served cold. The order of eggs benedict were served with a very small amount of hollandaise sauce and altogether offered little in terms of flavor or satisfaction. This was served with a modest portion of unremarkable greens. The other plate, bagel with lox, came to the table dry and semi-hard (seemingly toasted too far in advance of the other food). This was served \"deconstructed\" with roll of smoked salmon and a side of cream cheese, so the prep was truly minimal but still missed the mark. Along with the other items, we ordered house cut potato crisps which were good and by far the stand out item...but not enough to warrant a third chance considering the total price of the meal and the other options in town. \n\nThe cafe would benefit from reducing their offerings and concentrating on better preparation and synchronizing the timings so the food arrives to the table hot. As well as considering the removal of the microwave...I don't have one in my kitchen and don't expect them in a small cafe's kitchen.

Now even with this understanding, I still had a bad experience.\n\nOnce we were sat at our table, neither of the servers knew which one was going to take us. I know this because I overheard them discussing it until the one server asked the other if she was going to take us or not, with which she replied, \"I don't know, take them if you really want them.\" Ouch.\n\nAfter taking our order it took a good hour and a half for our food to arrive. I ordered the eggs benedict and when it arrived my poached eggs were fully cooked through and there was barely a scant amount of hollandaise sauce on top of the day old, barely toasted bread. Basically, everything I loved about eggs benedict was taken away from me. No one even came by to check on us and give me the chance to complain. \n\nMy friend ordered the Creme Brulee french toast and we're still wondering where the Creme Brulee came into play. Tasted like normal run-of-the-mill french toast to me.\n\nI found out when we went to pay, the servers pool their tips. Makes sense for such inattentive service. I will say, however, that our server was nice and I liked him for personality sake, but unfortunately, as a server, he left a lot to desire. Probably not his fault, this is probably due to lack of good management and organization for such a busy Sunday.\n\nI hope it gets better and I'll probably give it another chance in a different time slot, but unfortunately I'm not going to jump at the chance to do so for quite awhile.", "date": "2011-04-18 04:12:20", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id":

The place was small and the seating process was poor and inefficient.  There was a line when we got there with parties all greater than 2.  There were two empty seats by the counter at the window so we went up to ask the cashier if we could sit there.  She kinda ignored us and told us someone would help us.  A few minutes later, she offered the lady standing in line behind us something to drink and gave her some water.  Hello?!  We've been waiting for a while....why didn't you offer us or the other 10 people in line something to drink while we waited?   We waited for 20 mins only to get seated at the window in the 2 empty spots that we had inquired about.  At least the gentleman that seated us (our waiter) was super nice and quick about getting us our food. I ordered the Salmon Platter and it was pretty good.  Please note, if you get the Salmon Platter, do not get it with brioche.  My brioche was toasted and so crumbly that I kept coughing and choking on it. I had to constantly wash it down with my coffee.  My gf wasn't enjoying her meal and said it was just okay.  \n\nOverall the food was okay probably something you could make at home and the service was not so great.  The cashier lady was rude and didn't even greet us.  Though she was surprisingly very nice when we went up to pay for our meal.  She even had the courage to ask us how our meal/visit was....\n\nI've experience better food and service.  Maybe if the place wasn't so crowded, the service would've been better.  Two starts for the nice gentleman that waited and seated us....", "date": "2013-09-12 05:37:14", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "B3wkelZcsk_QmIg17QSKMQ", "name": "ben", "review_count": 360, "yelping_since": "2010-04-19 13:08:26", "friends": ["6WG2IGTVr-xKn0pYQZJGjw", "2ylQTUaLYd-3fjKhZGHUlQ", "KeIZC439yoCxMQdYS8GVWA", "eUlLKiRbX3k4VS3Ko_WxTA", "wFw9lZD_EsDSxBM5HIjy_A", "AvGJVv7Z3a0q1MJT1Ykd0w", "GevrFd8ojonAr4fEQB9WfA", "Zn45p_XL8sEJxLdex8ViHw", "7F2HuhNCQ4l2AnNOlIwrGw", "t2dUrGyWMkvRGIMB9x5BKA", "fMuEjcNoN7WsOzL6l-i22w", "KLhiiV7IaZikKYDNsR-bRQ", "faWa2rDpotq49mkcL75ICA", "tQzP0AiUXoQve5uFbjZUEQ", "99g7nwaGVrH10hvQPcz5eQ", "Fd5B5mrFBTF3msbfJNhvKA", "DJp-RvWsIyX9z-8SN2N7Ag", "a7O5G29SOBqviNYyCnOLFA", "QZ-fvDutKwGbTDl5_nm67Q", "24n-CeWJiJMTV1cYvNmezQ", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "FzgeSPVonioMutmnyIMnyA", "FUoJMKoFT-z2ngndqI3BCw", "DMoJvAK3kHZd5w_gS5zX5w", "PdD4AkokR8REi5PK_7sF7g", "FR8l90S6vufdXYdCNq7mLg", "mqMEBs3e-ilbL-jcfnfbog", "YAtUoMHKho7JfXkWnIXqIQ", "s_ushMFjAYjIvszJW2gOhQ", "oCnLbe9OGnpyQBY4E90bVQ", "7XBUXSmGoPzcl1w4KO-Uhg", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "xArneMw-cScJbx762lrlgw", "SNex-Q2qw1GaDyPv8ilp6w", "oO-V-EYgreg0pIB0kNQaaA", "YzgVf6q7yNVwClFnShMNOg", "QWGW8vpUu5SZ4AGT50DIvQ", "Yc32gzn-Phho2afitymtXA", "1CmhdHhJHokf2mkemRiY3g", "ShmFYIYOsWL7jhPmungKow", "oybS18bCDKMWh6JJ6HqJEg", "qlasifUq0x8VE6ba5Fs6cQ", "gP20yP4taj8EKLdV-P-fzw", "YbPlOJFKf14caEznwX-X0w", "MqHeXGuo0BeJ7GkNc6Mg-A", "k8y8sNAXTl6XMzg5Qr61rg", "77bWFsKrO9x2MFP-33Djgw", "liyo-tTalzj1FWgqlQzZnQ", "_BUOwgnpvAZvfXY2yY51UA", "DuC2TFDgADG_V47FeOP8mQ", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "yEGVLzZ2gS261MxOEmC2yw", "9ptA7x03Lex9g4aAcG1rWA", "xflt0qbyWb7qrFbLAV5XXg", "_TDTRzFhe8uRUK7IGxDXFA", "tipQmXdg181T4NvxrXPjFg", "2S_TNGTL1gDTDu3T2GYuXQ", "cndpW4OQV2tXy9Ek61u7hQ", "5skkmiVUt8HnfeQSQoh7bw", "XBeEmeV16yfP9EXLiqkRhQ", "-O2D7b6B-2KCIhnaR8Xj6g", "9j-51dHJ8_nXZQZi6_vPwQ", "o1y-OQhVwTA_cPqN5pBGIQ", "2LjoJtG-NprPWUfO09zgmQ", "KSrQ-qr-dXCcJadevuS1RA", "7ZauzmeTHuR-8FqnmJbOtA", "DO3TIDmqypuGlwKfpZqG6A", "QFjqxXn3acDC7hckFGUKMg", "GFEsK1awykJRcVmhq6z2DA", "CDbpq6RmA53hgVe3pNJnKA", "EQpFHqGT9Tk6YSwORTtwpg", "Ls0wyEROsq3LYptBDI5HNw", "PBJlE2X2896Hh6atcJv9OQ", "WXNi47QBnu0CkMBRsnKEqg", "dQk6A9_SV0gvPevBihwoGQ", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "i28paETijEhwXIFThx2kcA", "RUksLpxNHFGthYHLTXAnKw", "MzTRA7H6gARu_ZXQ-0Ys5w", "pQ6L9gch7catmCuqoQ5_lg", "FfmsXOCz0gIFMKb_WwJgOQ", "h8hul8ItjXfZW_XCfNj8FA", "fDBZPiu8aYEM2XgVDqYh1w", "t8kTHsZ7qa-JT1Ngz-h_bg", "JaTBxJfBSnbv_ilbjffIVQ", "Ks7YTEF_IIxrxBr-VffRFA", "K51u75MpQIZeknXVsoqIvw", "RKULSOrIvvYpDmtuYXEXzA", "yV9zI6dmWuWK9-gdYJ-06Q", "K3gfKQEw872uJ3z7MYylzw", "EH5fDg2zyTL4Ius29V5-xw", "A-5Fn5MxgLSra-rEMkOAPA", "cdF4T1LuDtl-BzOkiq6Jtg", "kK0zERmSy5YK2iA3d0NB_w", "y8S4sBhfX8E5RlqJQSL6Pw", "EuvpcCAJoNB_Mt2JFoFqJw", "AiwVzxg4paqeDX82O4oFLg", "kiZ44H-Tn_THgYv8msm9Sw", "u7lGgwVTmPaILJ0C1CwnHg", "uf0Wz5QhAfC8oXrzc_HNkg", "PqU5o-jJxCrBZDCAP-5oOQ", "7nq09jiKpW9xw9J9iKUbpg", "YJLMa0DDZbRIGaoqWoXUcQ", "E8y05o_cM_MDFABpdsh4zw", "7XXKi6pgXeX1uJZcGjKNRQ", "rjDuYaK41di3_CKioCHXLA", "F8o6TydRoeQx6vC54D7-bw", "dw8Fxml-pgEhkMURM7_SNQ", "gQMAYqasLOfNQxPdSkAAlQ", "xr2XiBVrAobsf4DbA0CrLQ", "0lX3gbniIawXeSkNoJuooQ", "QCNLvK6xxebYoItPU49-Og", "rKOVduk_kQpoIiom5lbBAQ", "RM6G9JU6Eelu885thT4jIw", "N8ITUUDRBpo1hTNDvk1byA", "pBXrs0aVaoW91GnGJ1OqZw", "luA22i7C3jvG4dizpq3IeA", "VoFTzkQC0P8qFSDCLT6Zbw", "mZF6xI4eF_nLDpEJYSrS0Q", "vfx8UBxoX-orx9WtpJF8QQ", "USYar-SN6q10DSrAR5-jEw", "HOzr6PtY4ZgiAGVR5hVlGA", "uL-EtFnoVIaVGWFpFyeK-Q", "ckePkT4UyXxVgL8wNlmhEg", "YTMCUL2EZUPeSIzbfnbegw", "JQwFxyxVgLwS2SemDKqzrQ", "OgLyhQefoJ35LZRhp8ugWg", "WISrooR1eImv2eaBTzgHSw", "mZKcXmR6LyXyvBR627rUtg", "QdsCvj8A9CQpach6_-f2uQ", "BQ7rpSFyaXya1snqsrNdfw", "o-k1cK6UizfxQaD-l26v8w", "Ctsg_mdG2QcZ6a1fSu46EA", "8mT-KllQQU_2Hcsfa-S_-w", "rJw6u9bwqD1fHlZtRQPayg", "pJ439Z_15TodoWCFKVMatw", "-1_P5WXnbjEG-mQFvdYR9Q", "_xytF9wdZ1JIkfJlZQ3RJA", "c9r1yATcuNon7wjnox6V4A", "0hi4IHF0C0X07PZhvtXlQg", "SGPCLi-kVZ_pz1w7VJtkeA", "EJ8pe71KG0UXb2SbI9ACKw", "5VI466ttsXjGabIJLAKMFA", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "Iw6uScVAE_MA7cHZey67yg"], "elite": ["2010", "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016"], "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 17}}

From reading their menu they look really good, and they are relatively close to where I live so I was excited to try them. We ended up waiting 30 minutes to be seated on a sunday afternoon, but I guess that it to be expected. Especially since the inside of this place is TINY. Probably about 5 tables and some counter space. They are also cash only, which is always the case with small places like this. The staff was super nice and even offered to get us a drink while we were waiting. The part that was seriously lacking was the food. The whole place has an Australian theme to it, and that's also where the name comes from. I got the eggs benedict, which was two poached eggs on top of a piece of brioche with canadian bacon, fresh tomato and fresh spinach. And that was it. Just that sitting on my big plate. Since it was $9, I didn't even think to ask if it came with homefries (a hangover brunch requirement). When I tried to order a side, I was told that the closest thing they have to homefries is \"chip fries\", which was fries in the shape of potato chips. I got them anyway, but they turned out to be very soggy and I was not a fan. The benedict was not so great either, and the bread it was on was hardly toasted. The coffee was surprisingly decent. I ended up spending $18 including tip on a brunch that was really not that good. I will definitely not be back, especially since I can get 5x more food (literally) at morning glory for half that much.", "date": "2011-02-07 18:57:32", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user":

My husband is there at least once a week. Which is why my experience sadly merited a review.\n\nWe showed up to a half full dining room for breakfast on a weekday. We know the drill on wait times, but we were sat promptly. And we sat. and sat. and sat. The waitress knew we were there but walked by our table about 9 times without making eye contact with us. We tried to catch her eye (didn't want to call out in such a small space) and sat for close to 15 minutes before we realized that she was serving two other tables that had come in after us.  She was also clearing empty tables instead of coming over. We had no 'I'm so sorry, I'll be right with you' - just totally ignoring us. The space is small, you can't miss us. You can't miss our menus closed, our patient expressions waiting for the yummy coffee and food.\n\nShe was so incredibly dismissive and rude. I was shocked. We got up, walked by her, said \" we are going to go ahead and leave\" and she didn't even look up and just shrugged and mumbled \"ok\". \n\nWe went on our way to Honey's where they happily fed us and took our money.\n\nI hadn't ever seen that waitress before and I hope to not again.", "date": "2014-08-19 21:39:38", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "6yS8HnjXTOxFvaucdMKaZQ", "name": "Mary", "review_count": 39, "yelping_since": "2012-11-02 20:12:28", "friends": ["FXJy01LSf3hQaBCi0dVRxQ"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.59, "fans": 3}}

If we could have made it through the busy brunch line, and sat at a table, I am positive we would have enjoyed our meals and forgotten about confusion of the wait. \n\nWe knew it would be busy on a chilly and rainy Sunday morning and expected a wait. The interior is tiny, and the only door in out for patrons and staff alike was the front door--where the waiting line feeds into. My friends waited outside in the crappy weather so as not to add to the cramped waiting area. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to give a name to a list--I couldn't find a host or hostess. The employees at the coffee/beverage bar were too busy to even look up... so I politely as I could interrupted the waiting patrons in front of me what I'm supposed to do. They equally as politely informed me that a person will roll by and take your count for your table. So I continued to wait. I probably waited just under 10 mins before someone asked. I said 4 of us. No indication of wait time or estimation. My friends hen joined me in the line. The line had not moved and we were trying to figure out a good place stand where we wouldn't be in the way of patrons eating at the front window bar, or employees taking bags of trash or buckets out the front door to the basement. So, we would kind of shimmy back and forth, just really unsure of what was right. Then after maybe our third shuffle an employee guided us with attitude and her arm to get out of the way of door and stand at the bar. That was about 15 mins into the wait. At about 20 mins into the wait, another host type of guy, asked us if were in line, and when we said yes, matter of factly, he made us very unsure with his \"oh really, that's cool,\" response. Now, we are sort of panicking, but the original host came back with an assuring \"you are 4 people\". And took two tables of two to be seated right away. The line progressed one table of four. So we moved up. But just out of the doorway. \n\nAt some point our anxiety really just took over and we couldn't get over not knowing how long we might waiting and the employee scolding us and the utter confusion it all, that we decided to throw in the towel. \n\nI may try again, but only for a table of two. I don't believe it's a place you can relax with BYO for brunch. If you have 3 or 4 I would absolutely go pre brunch rush. And if you have 5+ in your group I don't know what you should do--maybe order takeout or delivery.", "date": "2019-02-25 15:51:50", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id":

I'm still giving you three stars because your coffee, food and shop is still very cool but I just can't let you keep the five stars any longer.\n\nI really want to love this place.  I've come back four times since my initial review.  Each time I wait at least 20 minutes to sit down, which I'm okay with since all the great brunch nooks have a mandatory wait.\n\nWhat I don't like, is that each time I sit down, I wait like crazy for my food.  I'm not sure if it's personal, but each time I've come, we sat down before some groups and way before other groups but we inevitably get our food last.  A few months ago we waited so long after others got their food that I think the waiter felt bad and brought us a complimentary bowl of Tim Tams (which are delicious - I highly recommend them as a snack).\n\nWe went last weekend.  The line was long so I got a coffee and tea while we waited to sit, I was just dying for the coffee and couldn't wait another 20 minutes for it.\n\nWe sat down and ordered immediately.  A few minutes later, a four top sat in front of me.  A few minutes after that, another couple sat on my right.  \n\nThen we waited....\n\nThe couple to my right got their food.  The four top then got their food.  A fifth person joined them right after and placed an order.  We waited... the fifth person then got their food.  Our waitress hadn't even been back to our table.\n\nThe couple to my right finished and got their bill... still no food.  The four-top did the same, then our food came.  By then, I was cranky and starving so I just angrily shoveled my food down.\n\nOur waitress then promptly brought the bill and totally didn't care.  I still tipped her 20% out of fear of getting worse service if I do go back.  \n\nThis has happened four times.  Why Ants Pants?

YAY.\n\nour waitress was really chill, and i love the aussie-theme. what that has to do with ants or pants, i'm not really sure. but i wish i drank coffee so i could've at least tried one of their drips or their aussie coffee drinks.\n\nwould i go out of my way to come back here again? probablyyyy... not. hey, at least it made for one interesting and not-so-typical day at work. this is also where we were the day the little earthquake hit. we initially thought it was construction next door, had it not been for the rattling of the rickety tables.\n\nCASH ONLY. don't sweat it, it's pretty

It's a small place, so usually a line, but it goes by very quickly! This most recent time, we opted to sit at the \"bar\" which was nice since it was a little out of the hustle and bustle. However, our service was pretty slow, so just a heads up in case you're in a hurry.\n\nFor eats, I have had a few of their French toast options and a brie egg sandwhich. This time, I had the tiramisu French toast on special, which was delightful! Featuring challah bread, this dish had an espresso sauce drizzled and marscapone whipped cream (with espresso in it!) on top. It was the perfect portion size - enough to fill me up, but didn't need rolled out of the restaurant. I think that this dish could have been better if the bread was stuffed with the marscapone and espresso sauce for a better flavor profile, but overall, a good dish. My BF got his standard (he is 100% a regular!), the brie-stuffed French toast drizzled with apricot. I will admit that his was slightly better than mine - the savory brie with the sweet apricot and challah made for a great combo. I just ordered drip coffee, which was tasty but definitely not filled as often as I would like. My BF got the flat white, which was very creamy and delicious. Would love to try some of the other Aussie drinks in the future!\n\nAnts Pants is a super convenient spot for us to visit, and it is a solid brunch spot! Definitely recommend for a weekend brunch, but just make sure you are not in a hurry. Would love to visit again to try their milkshakes and other coffee drinks!", "date": "2019-09-05 02:54:28", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "fegUHze8ihummWgTzQ2VYQ", "name":

After all, there are plenty of other options in the same vicinity.  \n\nThis is how it achieved \"go to\" status.  For starters, I'm big on bacon, egg, and cheese.  Well they do it right.  In the words of Ants Pants all-star server Mario (you'll know him if you see him), (to paraphrase) bread is the critical delivery vehicle which brings the savory flavors of your food to your mouth (ok captain obvious).  Ants Pants has a multitude of delivery vehicles that bring those eggs, cheese, and bacon to your taste buds....what I particularly enjoy is this interesting powdery roll they use; I have never really had a bacon, egg, and cheese like this at any other establishment I've visited throughout the continental United States...and that's saying something folks.  \n\nIn addition to the great breakfast options (yes, they have great fruit cups, yogurt, sweet potato fries, eggs benny too), I hereby declare Ants Pants' coffee as second best in the city (losing in a hotly contested bought with defending heavyweight champ La Colombe).  Very hard to put into words,  but just the perfect level of roasting, perfect darkness, and I feel like it's never scalding hot.  \n\nOutside of typical breakfast fare, I just applaud Ants Pants for its originality.  There are myriad options of unusual sandwiches that I've not experienced elsewhere (maybe I am not as experienced as Jimi Hendrix was asking me)..but my lunchtime \"go to\" on this menu is the #7, which came recommended by All Star server Mario (the guy knows his menu and is extremely affable, helpful, and relaxed).  Let me tell you about #7 - You choose the toast, throw on lettuce, cooked turkey, AVOCADO, honey mustard, BRIE, and ask for bacon too...this is served alongside a little bit of salad w/ Balsamic.  If you don't like this sandwich, I'm convinced you just might have no soul. There are various other good bites on the menu, but I can't get enough of the #7.  It's just super fresh and delectable.  And by the way, get this...if you aren't in the mood for soda, coffee, water, or some sort of juice or tea, this place does MILKSHAKES.  I mean that's some decent originality given what you'd expect upon entering and checking out the menu.\n\nThe only reason this place gets 4 stars is it can be a little slow at times behind the counter...but that typically shouldn't be an issue since we're becoming a more casual, European society anyway (\"What's the rush?\").  But the counter speed is more than offset by really friendly workforce and quality eats.", "date": "2009-05-18 13:35:32", "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "PmnYuwzSTuQMeyrQ-ZduBA", "name": "James", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2009-05-18 01:12:14", "friends": ["S28xI6kkTFmBJWZL1X6gkg", "Hpg-ipu2E4af8HPkBcrl3w", "djxGzgJOQakL2yQVdQQSnA"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.33, "fans": 2}}

Since it was around 11am on a Tuesday, there were almost no other customers so it felt spacious even though it's a fairly small space.\n\nThe first thing that captured my attention after sitting down was their fun list of Aussie facts! It prompted me to do a lil googling of my own later (had no idea upon entering that this restaurant was related to Australia by any means) and found fascinating tid bits that are unique to this brunch spot. \n\nHere is some info from the Ants Pants website that was particularly delightful and may also be useful in shaping what you may want to order: \"Most of the items on the menu would easily be found in any Aussie cafe and the coffee from Australia's Tobys Estate adds to the authenticity (and some may suggest awesomeness)... The foundation of our menu items are uniquely borrowed from our experience working in several Sydney cafe's (a strong and competitive cafe environment). It's no secret that Aussies take their love of espresso drinks and their dining very seriously so we felt it was important to bring that love to the City of Brotherly Love, a city that at the time was still finding its feet in the culinary world. We like to think that we played a small part in building what we now consider to be a strong and vibrant dining scene.\n\nSome typical Australian items that are worth checking out include vegemite, served on toast or as a sandwich. Make sure to try a flat white (like a short latte or a wet cappuccino), the Aussie iced coffee (a decadent ice cream and coffee blend) or just a brekkie platter which is a staple around most cafes around Australia.\" \n\nSince I only discovered these details on their website after my brunch, I didn't know about these recommendations while I was there. So I had picked the Brie stuffed french toast, which was yums but slightly misleading in its title, as the brie slices were just places between two pieces of french toast lol. \n\nI love discovering the why and hows an establishment came to be, and all these Aussie facts made me enjoy my Ants Pants experience in a particularly special way, as I have recently had a growing fascination with all things related to that country/continent :)", "date": "2019-08-23 16:09:35", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "7nq09jiKpW9xw9J9iKUbpg", "name": "Jinsol", "review_count": 198,

Friendly waiter (the only one), great food, and a great seat (at the bar facing the street through the large front glass) make Ants Pants fantastic.\n\nOn the bridge end of South St. Ants Pants has a great location and blends into the community perfectly. Regulars are greeted by the staff and chatted up without pretense. \n\nWhile free wi-fi is offered, this small establishment isn't the sort of place to write the great American novel, rather, to be inspired for it. On this first visit, I brought a book, and felt right at home lazily making my way through a chapter. \n\nThe coffee, was fantastic, dark and with a bold hint of nuttiness. I had the spinach, goat cheese and caramelized onions omelette and an order of brioche toast. Let's hit the high points first. The goat cheese is creamy and wonderful. The egg is cooked perfectly (though I've always loved runnier eggs), the spinach is fresh and delicious and the caramelized onions have a smokiness that speaks of the countless meals to come before it. And the fresh fruit salad on the side was perfection.  However, the construction of the omelette itself wasn't quite what I'd hoped. Nit picky though it may be, the first fold of an omelette should not be the last, leading to toppings spilling out of the egg. Further, no effort was made to spread the toppings around as the egg cooked, the result was four bites of egg, two bites of onion and egg, one bite of spinach and two bits of cheese and egg. The sole bite that included all three was heaven, and I would've preferred that they all be so good. \nThe brioche toast was exactly what I'd hoped, crispy and toasted perfectly, and delicious. My only complaint involves inclusion. The toast was a side; typically egg dishes are served with a starch inclusive. \n\nI seem to be ending on such nit-picky negatives but I assure you I loved the place and will frequent it often. But as good as the food is, as good as the space and the service are (never saw the bottom of my cup), those small details are what earn that fifth star. See you all there, I'll be the one at the end of the bar with the book.", "date": "2010-08-12 18:37:10", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "eITyEhyqAmD3c_O1lUcQgg", "name": "Jason", "review_count": 4, "yelping_since": "2010-06-02 23:11:01", "friends": ["0dFVKuRt22hoGrrF-e1Iqg"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.0, "fans": 0}}

I could see how this place could get really busy fast. This place is very small and cozy, not great for huge groups but the space is nice. \n\nI would love to say that the food here is the ants pants and give it 5 stars, but in reality I'd probably give it a 3.5. Here are a couple thoughts: \n+ there are some good flavor combinations in some of the menu items... the bacon cheddar apple scramble was tasty and I got the dill scrambled eggs with feta. \n- however, I was a bit disappointed in that I sort of expected my feta to be scrambled in with the eggs, and the same goes for the spinach that came alongside my eggs. I ended up mixing them altogether myself, because part of the excitement in ordering that dish was wondering how all those flavors would taste together. \n+ the bread they use here is awesome. I don't know what it is. Probably a sprinkle of magic and honey. \n- the prices are a bit... pricey for what you get. $9 for an eggs benny that was good bit on the smallish side that left someone hungry for more afterwards... maybe you get the picture. Brunch ended up being  more expensive than I had planned before coming... come prepared! This place is cash only. ATM in house, but who wants banking fees? \n? there is a creme brulee battered french toast on here that begs a return visit... verdict on this one to be determined. \n\nCoffee here, despite the minor food woes, is amazing. I would definitely come back here for the coffee. There is some bar stool seating up front and on the side in the back, so it'd be a nice place to sit and read with coffee. They have a full regular menu of coffee items as well as Aussie coffee specialties. I got a flat white which is like a latte except with more espresso, less milk. It was really good - no - it was the ants pants. The hot chocolates were pretty tasty as well. \n\nOverall, coffee = ants pants. Food = not so much... mostly because of the variability between plates being worth the price and just not being as awesome as the coffee.", "date": "2010-12-27 18:10:26", "useful": 3, "funny": 2,

I'm a vegetarian so finding a place that served delicious, fresh sandwiches (on slices of bread, not rolls) and mouth-watering breakfasts was always tricky, but this place sure delivers. They are one of the few places, in my opinion, that concentrates more on their food rather than their income. Everything I've had on the menu was wonderful and their specials are always innovative and delicious. I would consider myself quite the \"foodie\" and this place gets high marks in my book. There is definitely a reason why Ants Pants has been recognized in so many magazines articles (check the window from outside).\n\nAs for the common complaints I've read, there are \"floaties\" in the water because when we fill the pitchers we add slices of either lemon or cucumber (hence the flavoring). Little bits of the flavorings in water will fall off when they're carried around so much. As for the customers, the regulars are some of the nicest people ever. I still see them on the street and they always make a point to stop and say \"hi\" (even though I haven't worked there for some months now). Unfortunately, like every restaurant, we do get a handful of annoying, mean customers (usually out-of-towners). Sorry if they ruin your meal, they ruin our day too.\nI guess most people don't notice when they walk in, but the place doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. Every piece of food put into your mouth or every drink you down was made completely from scratch by one or two people. They don't have a full kitchen, so time is sacrificed for freshness. If your meal takes long, it's because only two people are putting it together from scratch. They don't open a bag of pre-made food and pop it in the microwave like other restaurants. The same goes for the servers. There are only two people waiting tables on the weekend and it is EXTREMELY had to keep on top of everything. Next time take a look at everyone working on the weekend. I think it would be hard to point out someone who is just standing around and not preforming a task. If you want attentive and quick service, definitely show up M-T at any time or before 10am on the weekends.\n\nAlthough I am a former employee, I still think this place is wonderful. I try to stop in a few weekends a month to get breakfast or lunch. If you go, please try to remember how it's run. And if you want advice on what to try, ask the staff. They are some of the nicest servers in the city.\n\nOh, try the brioche bread on your next sandwich or the french toast and a side of fruit!", "date": "2008-01-05 06:02:13", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "IF6I0uW0ck2V7YBa5wxRWA", "name": "Melissa", "review_count": 27, "yelping_since": "2008-01-05 05:19:47", "friends": ["OtYTzmn-GshVYMMHwWCQ4A", "qVc8ODYU5SZjKXVBgXdI7w", "QX5xc3lzqhf6O_RAz-AbdQ", "l80t8mxXe0nNR-TT8K7m2Q", "RpJwVBqxFOhNt58ti-Brig", "6O0MxTs3Pzzj5cXSHgYmrw", "cP86_UM0ZL3s5yTmC0R0zQ", "y8aWXOimQ9ZgUgZ6q--nCQ", "L8LoKsZ9zncFoqqf5RiYgA", "Mcl4ANBEXn-9m1pzIjgYnw", "QBaeoagSm3RhtGilbJLdnQ", "JUztRjc5W1o3XbV2YNvo4g", "_joXAR44H5HoJ5PxNTNzgA", "53tdl2LZKBRKsnYGisGJ8Q", "RTxTtvzGrRlxpkctPH_P7A", "t7az6r7_Y9NhOE2BdSQtZA", "hjOkTZeZmuShHW5ZT8C_0Q", "ClLKj078sHyKLoCcfe9A0w", "bxKDTzan3sa2AjnTJpdwQA", "rfG9FpoS52U70ia67v7IMg", "ngsXQMnKtEiGoIYypr8_sQ", "-V_qZqXIODgq9tZYhz_4CQ", "LSAFRIq2OTZS2rRDN6fIig", "g2AkGEZ4wX863raQYSMMug", "jPF7nQ7WdPOQbewln6ZQYQ", "xVmNuFtZMLWaS5o-UI3VgQ", "7clhwQYINOezpTXbStuRmw", "TmWLsjALoNouy5UkdVMsWQ", "O_yiXH66SrORa4HsA2Uv-A", "QLTp7pjrEm2tozF7j1w1bg", "KsXVeIYonBUJX2lIJ6tleg", "IoB7lx5EuIGNnSYpelSLQA", "dTj2Z8MmRrx9ioys7McE9g", "_C22NOdngz4D6JAo292Zyw", "WN98k5sd8wW-uj-zHrytjA", "026357Am44YE19mFE6snIA", "ewuX05bfKJfOQW4mwINTyA", "SCYdC0G208qHRzXcFc_fZQ", "8NExSuuubaRkkAhqTxGlyg", "1Yt7lMDLbsSRkLRUgsGnmA", "7Dgfmuk3lltl6_ZjZidHjw", "BYAN5fHSiFb5rgwGbNb2Sw", "n3VIWL3gkqdjuFP4Om5hXw", "L6jXMnmfc8mZeQMn6PTTeg", "cbEGpriy-BHUIAGCg6UMrA", "YtDkNOGprBw4ScWPrHrEig", "JGi21qu2-Ke17BJgHaWe7A", "LqhQsRhv_G6Mdihv_BEpGw", "U5Z54VjCLZa8g8gxi2WFzQ", "xRn9ABHAAC4iArzhKXlTDQ", "_3Oqz0RVEcw-1SqvEryrbA", "h7OOp18gt1H2ernsUeiwcw", "2CzymJEGEGxBrnO6vUcIdg", "CtXbG0koOKw40RE9krHkOg", "TT57FXhNFiFwPsdFso8o2Q", "vptKMowq8XTV8NCvOc-qCA", "esFGCgXjsxzQDn0NkH61Bg", "7kiIyv5px4MTkhheq0vhSQ", "b5QphZ4h3PEXZ5xza2DLOQ", "_V8VByf0WjVcx3SnkuvswA", "MVGvinYCDuDflqr3lLW1hA", "0I7jiG82JGXhR3QKH-ZBRg", "reYRFKmwGNNaRkRsbIjr6w", "UVL_V4fF4FEmL4xZNo3phA", "oqJWHpYKhELVlHeFYU1jXA", "3B1CmrjXCoHcAoeeMrUInw", "CQH1EW06pgshhyDXBE_uag", "Ip3ObaRNmwcjGpLiF19Hcw", "7P9QSs5t8TpUfnUEdL-wMg", "sEJd6C7wyhk5V3hApugPHA", "7lopjcFZ8XYoPfw1NrcM3A", "3YtEa1fS-avzdzRc53mSyw", "4cNC0m_QwvN8-fB1KQAf3w", "HaEXRKEpJ5QKNfyMFXuBrA", "AJItouuyaUK-cPo9dt9iCg", "n7sJGZfoousQkGxtGLN1bw", "TNOJKoXvEpB1vKHUV5eXIQ", "2x90Ec6tFgwAGpJIjjYzeQ", "s76r1rcPMMWhfcVfkVq5YA", "CbfFwbuRfrOtW0X55U8HFg", "FKtoXdzuN83H7UsWZgmI6g", "uJJjr9wfucc-usOhMJKiGg", "GfZgJn3zyC9nPJaG3ZCJoQ", "NX_4eQ-3-ubnpzy5mNYEeg"], "elite": ["2008"], "average_stars": 3.81, "fans": 4}}

it's such wonderfully baked bread\n-brekkie platter- when i am craving good old breakfast food. it's your standard eggs, bacon, and brioche. it sounds simple, but ants pants makes it satisfying & there is something about how they cook their eggs.....\n-bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant- my guilty pleasure here. i have had many bacon, egg, & cheese croissant sandwiches, but again- there is something about the way they cook their food here that gives it an extra something special. the egg is fried to perfection, the bacon has just enough crisp but still a bit fatty, and the croissant is toasted slightly for that satisfying crunch. u just have to have one, trust me\n-fruit and yogurt w/ granola- now i LOVE fruit & granola w/ yogurt. and every time i eat out for breakfast/brunch i try to order a serving and am consistently disappointed. usually the fruit is just not that fresh, which sucks bc they usually way overcharge for this item. at ants pants the fruit is ALWAYS fresh- i give it to them to always serve quality food, the yogurt is thick & smooth (not greek yogurt, in case you're wondering), and the granola is dense, not that flaky stuff. the best yogurt parfait you will ever have, hands down. \n\nI am personally not a fan of sweet potato fries in general, but everyone loves them here & i always see a bowl of them on every table, so if you are a fan- i would suggest you try them! their lunch sandwiches are also very good- fresh, and healthy. \n\nSide notes: \n-CASH ONLY!! but there is an atm conveniently located inside....so smart of them...\n-The wait is usually about 30mins- 1hr during peak brunch times\n-Pay at the counter- don't try to decipher the bill, it's not meant for you to read ;)", "date": "2011-06-04 18:51:58", "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "yOO5Dj4CU-UJsnVxsSpVPg", "name": "Lowie", "review_count": 265, "yelping_since": "2010-08-07 00:07:59", "friends": ["GY6tKv0ZD8wuHCZKN165og", "PWrQ5EH-XdX8gaORnfbWKg", "IGIysxLGivyIV8yNk1LR4Q", "4cwcFEyAJrj_2Pvtn6zlGg", "UzoA9LnWvScjFc7-__i_Cg", "r1sLj85JPwZ_KM2eviuLVg", "PaAtdxE4o_jZoWYp58YPPA", "0TB3Ojkh-UjdyC0tVu24XA", "njbN_NVTJcoCzTSfTGTVIw", "iY0spihUoqZwApfWWC6Sag", "ITHHlYAUcDFeRNsLq3yI_A", "ApwWZBmsF9_gCwam6QnCag", "wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg", "22N9LnQCDY68uFxZXQYJ4g", "F5rPOOrJQBKuEA7RtuLnWg", "aDpVwjArtkBTSlFcpe8eUg", "gRWPvx4mv3z2S4dservfcg", "9Tm-IY6vyi5pzKwgEMrqpw", "q_QQ5kBBwlCcbL1s4NVK3g", "6zJVtC_qLMDp6-0vuqCZ2A", "WXhdizf2aBECAnyxjlG9Ww", "v5LvxWrscDM7XKpD6f0WxQ", "dUXyePIwjYoJ8v4O8ZOEsA", "3n-8y4LckDDJC7MDLjX0GA", "NEKGNxPq7gwhvxyiOQiV2w", "jrMxBHW3SlUGVGYWvPsHWA", "F1nAk2Pyfc8N4vKg9GPDJg", "dr_mce0J8Q-BLLOA23KuAQ", "vM9h0nu_SdICmEoT9NL9ow", "lHvPYR8_G66WQoMttc_PZw", "JB_Qflj9Q2I_c-22hcMwKA", "6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ", "TfGZ9TQs7ZxI9LgQJ8ZS0w", "v9VCObZVWhOPdm1rKt8Dvg", "nSpQPeweVMd7eWwFUozw8A", "FxRaqCWILU6029r17vOkMA", "yzQNdOMj5Dur06puIP5JHQ", "EIULm1RAYygMgWYox-G8TQ", "5pMbLOvKOixbwvs1OHsFBw", "EGPN58mF8YigxpZMvcP2EQ", "NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A", "lt5bJid3BYRUjXTo5JKKRg", "ujd6Jn1tYvsVlutQ_Kn4Ig", "TWr6mX1eMPHvfiy55OPdwg", "TflIFP0O0vfcR7VmtYjCVw", "hNXoEiL3kNPf8FNwBeyKbw", "XxL-wUMsK0E0VktTG9W_ZQ", "1SeR43Rk8HqqEAXnqan9Ig", "1I0FAXCtt-JBr03YAhfXdw", "UIF7_p2SkbKmGGoxcgY68Q", "NxdUKODBJDOSb-vDrX_p5A", "tnHYha5VMNIi-vxjnAU9Eg", "R0UpwLVQKjrHE-18zr-qUw", "t02TOjHVJxLoyo7Kp8Gs6Q", "QqWnqx07MGegmaNNbN8hLQ", "7KIjEy_zd0D1sFiPt8J-6w", "kiaDoWyp3xC2OiFIDA2QGA", "uhKnzfIMwjPG2OvjOfzP5Q", "F_G-E35q20USHFseLt1ZKw", "rmsenLwBQIFdNTbxK8IZrw", "q2jdpkIajauZK2NkHdGc3Q", "W7ybV7GHkzUMXJxvUSqjOg", "ZHtfveuPrgsv3EVe5DC4vQ", "mDBAmEsyxuVTTT70dK-dqA", "hMy8Ag7J12Nzx4A_iyAd0w", "sWm8NOlOP1jP6rzuAFCSiQ", "EmQlWfZP05CuXH5s704-jw", "xQ1COUFlJ02f6Ni597E2eA", "Ym_4LmOsxaSfO6GVgzOePg", "mur4yAGTCBseLkVA7q1f0A", "CZ4rH-l7l-AVWvpQz3tyOw", "kBVlEH9XOwC6MJsQMKLkgg", "lbYCczZMFCTaI6I3WiDFxA", "WtMx1Gzr2x97BxoG_bFGFw", "HiYqnPFWd6AgKJa9mg6qoA", "wihE3C3hOC_GsosoqnNJnw", "Dxdev0VPVFpNLvrpKzu8SQ", "bezNWssOZBjOZAhziM1ntw", "fVcdur3u2KqV0JcA3-Lo6Q", "PLlf6bQ9sSnzC2NBghD6sQ", "rUAcplNNGSQnBMmjhsQrHg"], "elite": ["2012", "2013"], "average_stars": 3.74, "fans": 19}}

If anyone ever asks me what I would eat if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, Ants Pants' Thanksgiving Sandwich might very well be my answer! Ants Pants had the best service; our waiter was the sweetest and most attentive. I'm dying to come back here already! \n\nIt goes without saying that trying to get brunch with anyone on a Sunday is bound to be a nightmare; you're either stuck waiting for good food, or stuck having something mediocre. On a day of strong winds and intense cold, Ants Pants had a decently long line, but believe it or not, they us seated in no time. The Thanksgiving Sandwich was by far the best thing I have ever had. Forget Wawa's Gobbler or maybe even Thanksgiving! The sandwich was so perfectly done that I'm in no rush for Thanksgiving this Thursday. Perfectly Toasted roll, stuffing that was the perfect texture -- not dry, not watery, just right -- jelly, and turkey that was of the perfect temperature.. Everything just came into place. This glorious sandwich came with the perfect sweet potato fries! I had never seen any place cut sweet potatoes the way they did, but I know for sure now that that's the only way to do it. Ants Pants has them in thin strips, instead of strings. This allows for the sweet potato to have a big potato to crisp ratio and an overall better taste. It cost $12, but was well worth the price. My date and I split the sandwich and the french toast between the two of us and were stuffed silly by the end of our meal. \n\nThe place was absolutely packed, but we were seated by the back in 10 minutes or so. Our food took a little bit because of the amount of people, but what I noticed about the way they serve guests is that they try their best to bring all of the table's dishes at the same time. You'd think that at a crowded restaurant they're bring whatever that came first, but Ants Pants very obviously recognizes that that can be awkward and takes the extra initiative to time everything perfectly so that both parties at any table can eat at the same time. \n\nIf I had to wait an hour for another brunch at this place so help me I'd do it!", "date": "2016-11-20 21:19:42", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "xUCL6HWTh6OgPnw8LSEbUA", "name": "Chi-E", "review_count": 45, "yelping_since": "2013-12-23 15:39:56", "friends": ["rZg5xWm--gdr6LiHoqe_AA", "t8dejSOiqcD6mfdgx3vuhg", "bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA", "CXLus0mL8mEqOhh-7d9PEA", "bcA_ITEDh8Qsky1FscLf_Q", "-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw", "OFiql6570Ts_rnq-OZQr2Q", "J1gc2iMG-xAF9GCxZvcdKA", "GfI-d9mQePFA2PvhAd4WGQ", "yE_1xqFxNkhQN8X-nL3cBA", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "IxoM8mRDv0T9J1SI5fFlQQ", "CcqpZkc5ngs88akzQ0rFHg", "3VaNXSd1hNQ2DORbw4noYg", "LFxCk4RujWjygvX2x67p-g", "r_7jblAEoCnTH-1uKjLh2Q"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.19, "fans": 3}}

There's also one on 4th that I'd like to check out.\n\n\nFOODRINK:\n- We sat out to get one plate of sweet and one plate of savory and share our foods. I recommend doing this if youre inclined to sharing dishes. \n- Brie stuffed french toast with apricot glaze: pleasantly surprised by how fluffy and balanced it was. It wasn't overly sweet or soggy like some french toast. The apricot glaze is the true MVP in this plate or else it would be the mundane. Wished there was more brie or that it was more evenly distributed but I am also a cheese fanatic. I finished this so quickly and would definitely get this again. \n- Spinach, goat cheese, caramelized onions omelette & fresh fruit: this was our savory. A bit disappointing. The presentation is mediocre at best. Wanted the caramelized onions to pop in the palate. Overheard a comment that this could easily be made at home and with a saddened heart,. I must agree. I wanted to really like it but it only served as to provide me with protein rather than a palate delight. \n- Fresh fruit: fresh indeed. Sometimes the honeydew or the cantalope is more on the raw end but not this lil fruity plate \n- OJ: provided for our mimosa. It's authentic fresh squeeze OJ that upgraded our cheap champagne to fancy shmancy level \n- Menu: had fun facts about Australia. I learned more about the country than I could have ever wanted or care for. \n- Reasonably priced for the quality and quantity\n\nVIBE:\u00a0\n- A very vibrant and colorful place\n- A lot of fun paintings \n- Cozy & casual. Feels like an extension of someone's house  \n- Helpful waiter with a red flannel \n- Indoor and kindaaa outdoor place in the back \n- Wait time for food arrival: 8 minutes 30 seconds.\n- Wait time for check arrival: 1 minute \n\n**TIPS**\n- BYOB \n- ca$$h only", "date": "2018-04-06 22:11:49", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "z393W1wNCBtcM-fNYIv_mw", "name": "Sehe",

I have worked at many different coffee shops that all came from different traditions.  And as you will see if you read my review I don't like La Colombe.  My reason's are not based on grudges and I'm not trying to destroy their business.  I even include some source material in this review.  I dare other yelpers to do the same.  I hope you find my review helpful.  I also encourage people who like coffee to embrace it fully.  Coffee has seemed snobby in the past, but I assure you good coffee isn't.  Look at where the product's coming from: \"3rd-world\" nations that are typically in civil unrest and usually have to deal with very extreme natural forces (volcanos!).  These farmers are not exactly members of the financial elite.\nhere goes:\n\nSo, I'm a Philadelphian... I was born here... educated here... I grew up in the cafe culture that it has... La Colombe used to rock my world with some milk and sugar.  Then, I went to Portland to visit some family and accidentally discovered Stumptown coffee and my eyes have forever since seen the light.  After a week in Portland, I came back to La Colombe super stoked for espresso.  I noticed the difference immediately.\n\nHere's the deal, La Colombe jumped onto the early 90's coffee band wagon and made an acceptable product for the times.  They were successful in a town that never really had much to claim for coffee, as opposed to the NW, Italy, or the Nordic regions.  Being successful, they never bothered to continue and progress or refine they're product.  Nor their barista's training, which after the farmer and roaster is the last platform in pulling off noticeably incredible coffee.\n\nA lot has happened over the last decades, in coffee.  Todd Carmichael, one of the owners, has been too distracted (crossing the South Pole) and too lazy (http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/worst-coffee-trends-060210) to take heed or notice.\n\nAnd it's easy  to see the latter when you a) check out the coffee, which is bad tasting b) check out the machinery which in my years frequenting his store has NEVER BEEN CLEANED (milk encrusted steam wands) and c) has non-transparent coffee... that is that who knows where the coffee's coming from... which is deceptive and typically a hint that the coffee is grown unethically and crappy.\n\nBut hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I encourage all who will read this to check out their website (which mentions coffee that tastes like \"exclusive\" ..?.. not cocoa or berries or ...ya know, real food); check out their coffee and espresso; does it have a roast date listed? Coffee has a short sweet spot after being roasted... less than a few weeks; are their beans really oily (proof of over-roasting or being too old); see how bad and unsympathetic their baristas are.  Then go to a shop like Ultimo, Spruce Street Espresso, Bodhi, or Capogiro and notice the difference.  The craziest part about the last referenced cafe is that they use La Colombe beans and due to their care for details actually pull a half decent shot of their espresso, despite the odds.\n\nWhen you care about how a crop is farmed, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared, the product usually tastes better (coors light or yards?).  Also, pretension doesn't equal good product and the great cafes mentioned above don't mix the two.\n\nI also encourage La Colombe to do a better job and give a crap about what they do and serve.  But with owners that are this out of touch and nihilistic, I don't see that happening.  For an interesting critique on Todd Carmichael's bogus article check out Chris Tacey's review.  It's interesting.  http://godshot.blogspot.com/2010/06/thank-you-sir-may-i-have-another.html\n\nHere's to better coffee in a town that's worth getting excited over.", "date": "2011-04-01 04:57:06", "useful": 22, "funny": 5, "cool": 5, "user": {"user_id": "SIF4p7FyhhoW4Y0pS9Lk7g", "name": "Charlie", "review_count": 6, "yelping_since": "2010-07-08 00:53:23", "friends": ["HcbNjwHtRjWgX1Hr-cFL2w", "4A_3ozf2Q0XKb7KHjnU9JQ", "3-mVghmesTgYvsP8p_14hQ", "YrEFUzaDormjigTV8TfOZw", "qyK-2GKcyerRyVQKtAlX0g", "6PPKENzAKxRLmifM4kKaJQ", "fgRtiaFPBv0fu20ywGtYzw", "ANECe0jaegD9cdCe94zYlA", "0fvMjqvgpoSHPzt2VnKANw", "tfoX9iI0rGKcvkOKgsUGCA", "oCe4mfzZitfRZTQYWCn7Zg", "raBtex93rDi2LXMgXeHa9Q", "Q66cFrplRk9wO5y4jGKpyw", "TZwKmfmbzevOtOoZhlZVxA", "VY_CQcA5bYR0np05tR6QBw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 0}}

I recently was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that dictates that I am not allowed to consumer gluten in any capacity, and it's been quite a struggle. I haven't had coffee in a few weeks since I have started this journey, but keeping with my routine now, I had to ask if the coffee contained any gluten. (Sometimes it's hidden in preservatives, or used for flavoring, and it's harmful in any form.) The response I received, \"Yeah, there's no bread in our coffee\", was rude, inconsiderate, and made me feel about 3 inches tall. Clearly I am aware that there is no bread in your coffee, and perhaps you are not educated enough to understand that sometimes gluten is toxic to certain people and not all people are gluten free due to a diet fad; however, the response was neither warranted, nor what I would expect when paying 2.50 for a normal sized light roast coffee. I apologize if my question, which was regarding my health, was an inconvenience in the morning rush, but because of this statement, I will never return again.

I almost feel like I don't need to review La Colombe, as everyone is aware of its existence.  I used to go to La Colombe often, before I saw the light of what actual quality coffee tasted like.  So I have this complex opinion about La Colombe, but I think I've kind of seen the light for what it is. \n\nFirst off, yes it's inexpensive relatively for okay coffee. But you're trading off the fact that you're not getting great coffee. The coffee itself is nothing to write home about. I'd go without it.  The espresso is good, I usually get a double macchiato or a cappuccino when I go there. I'd say that the place is fairly mechanical, and it will give you the same thing on a consistent basis.\n\nSpeaking of consistency, you will always find yourself with a long line and seating is at a premium. You'll find a lot of couples who will be ravenous in the line, send one person to get a seat, while the other waits in line. This is the name of the game, as no one is really respectful enough to wait in line together.  There's a tendency for there to be loud children with their parents, thrashing their strollers back and forth, trying to, simultaneously, annoy the shit out of you by making an obstacle course, quiet their crying child via carelessly rocking the baby without any regard to the actual problem, and keep talking about that new Dior bag that Veronica just could not live without that they just think is trite.\n\nThere's a tendency for haughty privileged middle-aged couple to boast about their 401k's loudly in front of you in hope of you hearing how successful their meaningless life is.  If you can't tell, I don't really like the fanbase that La Colombe has.  Let me put it this way:  I'm surprised I haven't seen Mary Kate Olsen talking about her Vera Wang snuggie in this joint.  I've never gotten through an hour at La Colombe without the need of rolling my eyes at some absurdity like this.\n\nI'm always amused that these people that are enthralled by expensive things go to a place where the coffee is mediocre, and could be better somewhere else by just adding a couple of quarters to the price.  I think La Colombe has a certain reputation of being amazing in Philly. I don't understand it though.\n\nIt's almost mechanical, where people expect the same cup every day when they go here, and they will get it here. The blend never changes, from what I can tell, and there's nothing truly exciting about La Colombe.  I like their carbonated water machine and almond croissant. That's about as excited as I get about this place.\n\nIn summary: If you're a douchebag that's spent all but two of their dollars on a new Michael Kors bag, and you need to go to a place to be around like minded douchebags to display your newly acquired display of \"wealth,\" get a coffee here, and put a bunch of sugar substitute and skim milk in it.

It really focuses on the coffee, and I'm a tea person, not a coffee person.  I'd appreciate more effort on tea too.  It doesn't take much effort to stock a handful of high-quality loose-leaf teas along with coffee (tea is easier to prepare well than coffee, IMHO), but this place doesn't even seem to try, it just wants to be all about its coffee.\n\nIs the coffee here good?  Ehh.  I do drink coffee, and I have opinions on it, although I'm certainly no expert.  I will say, the stuff I've had here is good, but it is not the best coffee I've had.  In order to justify its coffee-snobbery, I think this place would have needed to really like, AMAZE me with their coffee, and they failed to do this.\n\nI do like that La Colombe does direct trade -- that's great.  I'm also a big fan of shade-grown coffee, both for the taste and because I like the ecological principles behind it, but currently, I have yet to sample or even see for sale a single shade-grown coffee from this company.  Supposedly they have one in their \"workshop\", but I have yet to try it.  This company is lagging behind others, there are so many good shade grown coffees on the market.\n\nWhat about the ambiance in this particular shop?  I don't like it.  The walls are red, and it feels...for lack of a better descriptor, arid, conjuring up images of parts of the American Southwest or drier parts of the Mediterranean.  It doesn't feel cozy or comforting to me.\n\nThere's also a sort of weird vibe here that I don't like.  One of my friends articulated it to me, that there's a long line of people who seem to know a lot about coffee and know exactly what they want.  The people working the counter are nice, but when I've been in here, it's been busy and high-pressure, you get to the front of the line and you don't have time for chit-chat.  I don't like that sort of vibe.  I'd rather go to a sort of friendly, down-to-earth cafe that offers a few shade-grown coffees and has a good tea selection too, a place where I can chat with the people behind the counter a bit without feeling like I'm imposing on the people behind me.\n\nAnd lastly, the baked goods?

What actually happened was something different.  When you first walk into the space it looks pretty cool.  You get closer to the counter and the baristas are spot on friendly and make you feel welcome.  I see the two big espresso makers behind the counter, they look convincingly cool.  I get my cafe mocha in a ceramic mug since I'm planning on grabbing a table and being respectful of the planet.\n\nWe eye an empty table and snag it. I look down at my mug and the coffee looks good, a nice finishing touch with the froth. I sip my drink expecting that moment of it's going to be pretty hot, but it's going to be drinkable.  Well...turns out my coffee was not very hot at all, it was a little warmer than room temperature.  That was the first let down.  Then I take another sip, where's the mocha flavor?  The mocha is TOTALLY lacking, almost no sweetness at all to my drink.  When I order from of my usual coffee joints I usually ask for half the amount of mocha.  I don't seek out mocha because I want a drinkable candy bar so it's not that I love it overly sweet.  I just like a hint of mocha, yet this drink, no hint.  In fact you could have told me I was drinking a cappuccino and I would have said you were right.  Big time fail on the cafe mocha guys.  \n\nSo, as I am complaining about my drink to my wife I am also noticing the decor.  The incredibly half ass \"faux painting\\finishing\" on the walls.  Seriously. can you please put some money and imagination into what your coffee joint is going to look like.  Sorry, but besides very good customer service this place failed miserably.  One last good thing, the price was very reasonable.  Then again, bland, semi-warm coffee doesn't deserve a high price tag.  \n\nThe place was packed though and kept getting more and more packed.

My first time in I remember being a bit underwhelmed by the taste of the coffee, but I kept going back to La Colombe because that's where I would meet my friends, I knew someone who use to work there,  it was close and convenient, and frankly I wasn't aware that better coffee could be found in Rittenhouse. \nNow I've found the better places, (read: Joe, Elixir, Nook). At La Colombe the espresso tastes  bitter and gross, the cappuccino has a nice foam but you can barely taste the coffee underneath all that milk, the regular coffee also tastes burnt and forces itself to be consumed with either milk or sugar.  Also it is very lame they don't offer soy milk. Now I don't really like regular milk, but I make an exception to drink it in coffee sometimes, on a regular basis however I would prefer to drink soy milk or I choose to drink my coffee black.  When I once inquired about why they didn't offer soy milk the barista told me the owner was a traditionalist. Hmmm interesting...  I could go on a rant about that in itself but I  won't.\n\nAll in all  I think La Colombe is the kind of place for people who have graduated up from drinking Starbucks and Dunkin'  and by that I mean they still take their coffee with lots of cream and sugar, but they still don't know what wonderful coffee can really taste like. \n\n \n***Also yes the water machine is really cool, I get it, I like it too.

I already knew something looked wrong from the darker color of the coffee swirled in the milk. It was burnt (yes i know the color of the crema doesnt matter but it does matter if it normally is lighter and the same coffee) I drank it, but I didn't enjoy it. I probably should've said something, but alas I didn't and checked it off as a bad one-off... \n\nA few weeks later (a month maybe?) I return to the same location and decide to order an espresso.

The barista started talking to me, asking me questions, trying to have a conversation while he was pulling the shot, maybe that's what killed it. I took my coffee and sat down with the rest of my party already having noticed that the \"crema\" was very dark, not a definite sign of \"burnt\" but i could smell it. One other person in my group also had his coffee (their regular drip) burnt as well. Even less drinkable than mine. To the point where he, a person who basically never takes anything back, took it back (which they did when they smelled it and realized it was really burnt). I had already chugged half of mine so i decided to stomach it again... \n\nMaybe they're fazing out their Nizza? And I should try their new single origin? Next time I will. Stick to the craft coffee my friends... La Colombe atmosphere is so nice, their pastries delicious, but I don't dare try their Nizza ever again at this location. Will update my review next time I'm in town.", "date": "2016-03-17 18:07:17", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "_UpLg9avlNvvB7JbEj0KtA", "name": "Stephanie", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2012-08-31 06:34:12", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.0, "fans": 0}}

You used to be one of my favorite coffeehouses and I used to beam with anticipation every time I got ready to take a cup of your coffee into Rittenhouse Square. But I have to jump in with the people who say you've been going down hill.\n\nYou still have an incredible product. I love picking a bag of your Corsica at Whole Foods and brewing it at home. In a lot of ways it's the best part of waking up. But I agree a lot of times that I've picked up your coffee recently the beans have been burned to hell! You could definitely learn more than a thing or two By going down to Bean Exchange Coffeehouse and figuring out how to roast coffee right.\n\nand whats with the attitude that some of your baristas have? grant it I do get great service a lot of times and you have some good people working there. But often times as Nate says I get a snobby server with a high and mighty attitude. um, your pouring me a cup of coffee! maybe you should send them to one of the other cafes that sale your brand so they can learn to get a better server attitude.\n\nYeah. your still one of the best. And in a lot of ways you helped shape the indie coffee scene that's is so prevalent in Philly. So you earned the right to have some off days, just not as many as you've been having. look around you and you'll see a ton of coffee places that are stepping up their game better than you are. Maybe you can work out those kinks and get back to the way that you used to be. Either way I'll probably be back for a cup in the not too distant future.\n\nSincerely ~\nMcThrill", "date": "2008-03-31 15:10:02", "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "user": {"user_id":

This location is in the heart of Rittenhouse but this espresso bar is not one of my favorite.  Came here with out of town family and found it strange to find no menu anywhere in sight. There were long lines so do they just know exactly what to order?? Were they all regulars?? It just felt strange.  I just ordered a medium ice coffee since I know they must have that...right? \n\nFunny thing was, my husband and brother in law ordered the macchiato thinking it was a drink.  What they got was a shot of expresso instead.  Since it was our first time here...who knew? We were comparing it to Starbucks....which is not a good idea!\n\nAlso, I was looking for the restroom and since they had a long line....I didn't want to interrupt the staff.  I started to proceed to the only door I saw that had no sign what's so ever.  I didn't know if it was a door to the basement or closet....Jeesh! I think it would be helpful to have some sign for those out of Towner's or non-regulars. \n\nAlso, my 7yr old ordered hot chocolate but she complained it wasn't the same as her regular hot chocolate from Starbucks.  I tasted it and it had no sugar what's so ever. The server should have informed us since he saw that this was for a child.  Since we already left the spot, I had to make my way to another coffee house....and it happen to be Starbucks that was close by!", "date": "2014-07-23 20:06:26", "useful": 3, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "t8lkeiI5ZE5EWbHdI2FwBQ", "name": "Ratha", "review_count": 74, "yelping_since": "2013-12-17 04:32:22", "friends": ["7XwoWzjGTHV1a4vIpgGGkA", "2qKOL7C7WbG_M3EOWvTFxA", "qFwJ08Fs1Yvk-cJ98j7xsw", "Part5zzvcDDdQDt_Yd7VJg", "URTnq_KYnZtKZOhPvAIlwQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "wEYuzAy871ENeovi7IN0yA", "ARC6rEVmnVkZtnQ8apDX6w", "hhUzvEUsr5WivXpXw-sAjQ", "Y2sxi9Kc4tc7WvB_idxjAA", "i3jcM4k0rjUYrnPD-Pg5fQ", "-OZPBHH7RzyPIai4AlPWKA", "hJt1Wq0j5Xfha6BvgwE5pQ", "uDxktCK52XT0iOn7mrYnHg", "jnP_wqOZGUsWVMwNH5jD0A", "l_5iaa0MREofT7KIZIH4ug", "Wk_xohYcysEWnkhOp3sBSA", "bTiQztu4X5tG45Lnt-GIwg", "bsMGQruRQGgQZK4KA9Q4Aw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "tBp3RR6P_i5ztaDlValLbw", "IbcN4166DZfIaGqWgkZhNw", "ReF7OCyPA516XDtP-c_fFg", "6_UAPDLKiK8Vi_q9DOoLAg", "INfMSXEkdlqeCG60RWhm3g", "YuhkGJzn7mowTx1HmyxugA", "sppG3hwAzwwutTy6vcp4Rw", "VcOZajIATKWc9XUm5PiDng", "Mh1UjLE3usbzqeJtVD6L5A", "HJXMnyQc69k2S9FlEYbbQQ", "VVs0OoDD7ikOS5Qtme6YQQ", "DQlFEyiZtSHA5tm1BGP20g", "oLhl1wAWl3dR2H0A5waOqg", "RI8WxmUqIlyTG7RzPjz3GA", "bySrw8VrB_dddh60xpDcbQ", "dsX3MiQiTy3OVI8MKn0I4w", "81E27lL25iFXinm-fLRo3A", "904ZF83mcJkvJSoPYn00bA", "sQqC0QGQsPo7_E76ZccFNQ", "av29hHTIYR3LgtljozyqzQ", "904JxVNiO6rPJ4iQuYTyiw", "2OiyOHo7CQY05bFwY55HjA", "91swy_LSXRETGSAqEV0Oew", "YLLYzelJPS1Hd96BFOPFMA", "ClrG28HXVKhBR56r7XIv-g", "W2a6alHQjywluE-MNpr6zg", "1JlOo8MoX4e67l34aRulrg", "o9WyNGlA76Sjk3JxkTX8JQ", "mrPubn9rD6U-jGE61O49fA", "PyDgLxQUIwjQTlQIkjOSgA", "ofcNXCyNDkZ7kEKKqMazGQ", "O8bZP_pQT3WWplV3fxawFw", "rQpeGsQxKeImuUS3QP7OcA", "h0N_nxjHRgb9yNVJLu0WGg", "48E3gBLdgDRZxF6--O6vPQ", "MFn8xqkVklmb6KelS7jUiA", "taqZAz48zB6P0OyzHl9owQ", "57Cx52STMoGZXYJuRIZ2iQ", "unfMni6NMuWKF6AC0XdTLQ", "dxUhjUbLs5IZkn1V37Kp4A", "WroWA_0PNRecLHhWdlxpnw", "FsMs2Zozu8SH7hUZJTdqFA", "P2epFHigkHzKhggZqb4hOg", "i6OW527S2JQTCKg496C1Gg", "-5taYR7RP4a-moPqkzWJUg", "MgGzrXm2ZV_gC-jG2MwWyw", "ovsLfNfqY1a1tPjsQ8xeHw", "tixCwvN47VQTYeEkQjeGRA", "7v8XgnLAFHuhSz6-A5OC4Q", "Ub6HqZHMw94ok-aOZpw8_g", "-hUq14HolMwoooDkNTbbCw", "VsKKGKX3pOiApq5SIZ-J8Q", "bi5YvSX9TNN_im8j3zdS3A", "WdQCQMjBBWG5fj1qCkNL_A", "vxKBLHGVmvYjFTAviA12Cg", "91WrTCJ7o9oZF1oYd1K8AA", "ykQ7a9jwpZPQIXP6_us8zQ", "lZbotco47bHU7oE5b3d1DA", "bQ18G0_EK-ExXL_GcZ1cYg", "Ppy3_a44YggnckypQi2BuA", "c5Dj2vvNwpk7x9ZGIPfsNg", "2bjyS0F9Fg1p5McJQ7xyMw", "gRPza9BNbe9XURzNDZMk-Q", "WKHsyopwzYKNCZQH7S5SJA", "190KwlSWfxzxKvWl5aoKAA", "yBpajT9TpzIpLtINu3Xl0w", "gezIIZfShcv_oMY9nFtAng", "TvzNt0Mz7J31SJ87SnVO5Q", "C4B6RgkukpYin_Avl3c8Ew", "XhIPYT_sAGb4W020fwmkHw", "FVXLwworadK1v77iaNVQ3A", "Xmx22-8r0mHa6kyJWnfM6w", "7RlyCglsIzhBn081inwvcg", "0l-6FG2dqWJIlQIBeERTyQ", "zL-NgjIoK9peXeSS9ODkbg", "hIZiWElzEfM4Jh_xkrDVpg", "0FFJUW2QHjCYIerdyXievw", "E8RgeQeEF3xD6CcopTNjhA", "GTM0Jv2ayEgjcwnXXP7D8g", "mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB-MmS9g", "CEUswYigWrIH7a-_LlLuVA", "E3XSqVciR1Ecj_yhDoDMGA", "S15xlPJpL057M1pSa6lwrw", "YurXSioXcr2JETjB_vS4WA", "vg798k_JsrlC7zA6SY1SHA", "8oSeZxyxoTlmY046CMu71Q", "wrSgIfKfrHcN6meDFp68MQ", "K_dM0CZKjMi5SM9P8q5C8w", "TwgQb6iTLcBSs4hzErTRag", "OmL2bjLvvRxg1brM5Pehgw", "HJ9cvmb3OK9nicr7KVJkKQ", "qLhcnvoavuNDOcUXWqgQlg", "PhUqhfyk3jdaS0Xb619RJQ", "yRXT-LxmlSXxMFxIjle0ug", "HumTBsORL4u0RkdgO8bAXQ", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "JOQriYzT5_vaEYKgx45Ebg", "Q4EAPcnRENIIHFBmO3JLvQ", "YWDD8KqwwMytBMaUPl0McQ", "gFVLJRSTeHIQs97vIVGI-g", "xbgCToPThK1IVNdt3nkvGg", "W1eHcjd6kwKAzeFwDoOuJg", "67jznGBPOlZiZfC71RipQA", "KtFZl6UHtxG9aAcnyV-jMQ", "N0LfSpP4RNS9t3GwIcuNxA", "QWiPqi3QIX42xQ16jKUG1w", "aliZf4gG4xrclljDGFX_Jw", "wUmQpPuLWrSUvVW7YzdAWg", "lRRuTimITgwzoXLIM3g9qw", "9KF-XeG3umKXSyMbdx_raA", "quwGxY_f9AW8PIRUztSqjg", "IwHLuykqqmGVNHJ_UCwXWg", "n5wsebG0VV4-q4Wqf029dA", "fSHV5ayWBSlWvT9ujgYaHA", "o8GPP5w3fE8Q_KzifxlxQA", "rtWG9aXKqx-SNp4-NqiBeQ", "DsHkwKjrwl-RUxTvmFcO_w", "UdGNZaiYK49H89hXAoOK8w", "g5od9T4-hBMqKPdzsdPGOA", "kwcZaFdfZlGiFfeDxvuyNw", "7KqlIsj24Udez1jwMMiN3w", "Am1OzH6VonNo3Kcs4iaq-A", "pRT6Mjn2tnyVp-7fvValbg", "YdifV7V8Mv3DMISCDSVmSQ", "PUmH9xUVMo2azbdGwcVnEA", "1JfC2XDvEKUp8ZCatD4AVw", "DXV1RlL75vuEzHkVPqmyXg", "h7l9rdBwafO63BUxqcMZqg", "h1jRN69RHNkmvhpAeYsGug", "uAxT_ymDBlvSdnl91xgR6Q", "fC8bVXOaHV7DRNkvWkH-aA", "nAf3vXdyQDIvIgHprruhOg", "sK2rNBz39JxEs5i-mHuXcg", "jYvyfDJg_3nu5eAxGhOCJw"], "elite": ["2014", "2016", "2017"], "average_stars": 4.01, "fans": 14}}

It seems the key attraction of this place is that they are not one in a chain of stores serving up commoditized beverage widgets. As you'll notice, when walking through the front door, there are no price boards. They simply assume that you are willing to pay, being that you've decided to visit. This can be a classy alternative to dealing with customers that hold up the line as they attempt to make a decision. Most patrons seem to know exactly what they want, so this is a coffee shop where no explanations are necessary. \n\nThe customer profile seems a little different than the regular coffee shop. They appear to be just a little more mature, just a little more sophisticated to a degree. From professional mothers to grad students studying for their upcoming exams, you'll find a subtle difference to the kinds of people filing through the door on a hectic weekday afternoon. \n\nWhen I approached the counter, the girl attending appeared to have a bit of a poor attitude, but when I heard her speak, I realized she was foreign. I appreciate friendliness more than the exoticness of the nationality of the person behind the counter, but I'm not complaining. She handed me a paper cup of the drip brew, then a lid on a dish with a spoon. I really appreciated the way they have all their sugars and creams seated in ornate pots on the front counter. But I wanted to discover the fineness of their brew unmolested by those fixings. \n\nWhen I asked the male at the counter, he told me the coffee was their \"Corsica,\" a multi-region blend. As I sipped it, the coffee seemed to be only medium bodied, with little to no acidity, and an underwhelming flavor. In fact, it seemed that it was just a little bit watery. They may want to check the proportions of their water to their coffee, because as it was, I didn't think that it was anything to get excited about. It may a few steps up from the brew they serve at Wawa, but hardly deserving of the title \"gourmet.\" \n\nThe furniture in the lobby was fitting: tiny chairs with tiled tables. I noticed their furniture actually matched the ceramic items with which they served their coffee, and that was a nice touch. The music playing in the lobby had it's moments. I prefer the nondescript drizzle of lightly thumping electronica in the background as opposed to a music selection based on the tastes of the people working there. How many times can one hear Rob Thomas and Santana's \"Smooth\" before you get tired of hanging around? \n\nOverall, La Columbe is impressive as a sole proprietorship, but as a coffee shop, it's only a notch above average. If you're in the mood for something different than your regular corporate coffee shop experience, than this is a place for you. It's not like the city has huge variety of options.", "date": "2008-02-21 19:58:42", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "_ipbDsFa8UYu3SRYNPUUXg", "name": "Jason", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2008-02-06 07:59:35", "friends": ["SIMO-3LqLKLJs-_zxCv3CQ", "-blIGZ9I30dabVhLl87ZXw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.75, "fans": 1}}

I am a fan of La Colombe over Joe or Elixir. Elixir's coffee just wasn't that great and Joe's latte cost me an arm! \n\nNow, I'm not going to rave about their coffee for too long (lots of posts about that on here I'm sure) because I'm usually a drinker of decaf. I am super sensitive to caffeine and regret it every time I order \"full caff\" coffee.  I try to be super woman though and think I can take it. I was too excited to try their ice draft coffee (something they just started offering in the past couple of months and no they don't offer it in decaf) and was jittery within an hour.  Don't let la colombe's 12 ounce cup size full you. I feel that smaller serving of coffee from la Colombe packs the same amount of caffeine as a 16 ounce pike place roast at Starbucks. \n\nNow what I do want to rave about and my FAVORITE drink here, is their HOT CHOCOLATE!!! This is hands down the best hot chocolate I've had from a coffee shop! Usually other places make it with chocolate syrup or that nasty cocoa mix made with powdered milk or some kind of hydrogenated milk solids and tons of sugar! I am lactose intolerant so powdered milk is no no for my stomach. La Colombe's hot chocolate is like a cocoa powder latte! I get it made with almond milk. It comes totally unsweetened. I add a bit of simple syrup to sweeten it. It makes the perfect true dairy free dark hot chocolate! I wish I can just mix almond milk and cocoa powder at home but alas, the steamed almond milk makes it.\n\nThe baked goods here are delicious, too, although they are expensive. I like the chocolate croissants. My coworker is a big fan of their chocolate chip cookie but it's a hard cookie with hard chocolate chips that stick to your teeth. I prefer mine chewy and gooey.\n\nThe only reason I give this place 4 stars is I agree with another reviewer about the less than inviting ambience. The hipster male baristas aren't the most open or personable. They seem too busy or coffee-snobbish to chat with you or make eye contact. I always feel pressured to order fast. There's also no menu, prices, cup sizes, or explanation of what the weird coffee apparatuses on display are, so if you're new here, the vibe makes you feel like a total uninitiated noob. Maybe a lot of people feel this way, so they just stick to ordering the same thing every time. It makes the line move faster.

My fellow Yelpers are greatly divided in their reviews of La Colombe of late. It seems as if a lot of the negative reviews are due to either the clientele, or the fact that the coffee is not that good (due to the hype?), or the place hasn't changed with the times as Americans become more and more particular about their coffee. My take is that I like this place. I like the coffee and the staff, and thankfully, have not had to deal with all of the A-holes, D-bags, and Upper Middle Class J-offs that heaps of a Yelpers have been crying about. Trust me, I can be as cantankerous and bitter about uppity wankers, but usually I speak up, and just tell them to shut up. I show up to La Colombe at odd hours, and am never here during a mad rush. I don't live in Philly, and am usually in Rittenhouse in the afternoon, and early evening, so my only pissy gripe is that they (understandably) close at 7pm. And that the bathrooms are sometimes filth pits. \n\nI do agree that La Colombe's coffee isn't the best I've ever had, but its WAY above average. One fellow reviewer stated that he's seen steaming wands crusted with milk, and that the baristas never clean the machines. I disagree. I've seen, the guys and gals that work there take care in what they do. I also ask them questions, and everyone I have spoken to has been extremely helpful. Granted they are not slammed with a million customers at this point. Also, my only order when I go is an espresso. Single, double, or triple. I really don't drink a whole bunch of frothy milk products, so I can't tell you if they do that well or not. The espresso is definitely pulled well, and certainly not the best, but blows most places out of the water. I have been to many European coffeehouses in places such as Austria, France, Italy, and Hungary that have been operating for generations, and have had coffee equal to or inferior to La Colombe. I think coffee can also be a very subjective topic like the cheese steak. Everyone has their opinion of what is the best, and their criteria is almost always different than your own. Anyway, La Colombe usually does the trick for me, and the sparkling water machine is a real plus.", "date": "2011-06-23 14:44:10", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "IWxNILja-WvurTuJWJ4skA", "name": "Jeff", "review_count": 73, "yelping_since": "2010-11-19 18:05:16", "friends": ["2BQSwNG0iHSY9Cesd3UX7A", "RgDVC3ZUBqpEe6Y1kPhIpw", "-1MgskKaxHt5pttc6hz6PA", "0ssC5ACRGNLQ_i-vX8GqwA", "edeA6G4mxGNGYhxYznu9Eg", "9BBSCES-qXCn8ReFVL_bfg", "x1_sp_rHxZtI8VLX_IF5cw", "ljDvuID7AyHmJ0GJqfV5_A", "EwC2yKxGHCa78YodCp-Sfg", "tn6qogrDbb9hEKfRBGUUpw", "AtZ5hAERArUCN-9L6SnoPA", "pw21atkeOy5CUtp8z5RCPQ", "bBd8sOgkhbaEeZHjczV8ZQ", "MPh-WwKYBU76l1EXPW6v5g", "I747RIfuvimyWPGbMuj9Sg", "gyMSJrfyGPdcOeYBK2cqmA", "YDJEIfOlIFoTKTqhhtKtGA", "wu0bQJxq_XdIpH_VMU0KRA", "jXTXRch5oHyKaS4ZodVs5Q", "S1bcv4QpwW7Ysy0T9edlOQ", "ij7kqaoPR_Zwtcrxn11kXQ", "z9uf9-0uX5Jh8-4Y5l2PQg", "cbBDbbaIw4E4mR6dmZSwQw", "arqU7NBFx8m0zVB1_egcXQ", "vTULFTxtXjy-k4vnRTckAw", "bErSSaGsJwPVbuXms_XPgA", "KlnpGuDLd6ASwRhWYSPtsA", "eXxLvHu2Zzypg9LSZad8ow", "N7rhhn0pMto6yHAAPxdjAw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "qsSDaQ_X6yVHuNxnH1tLpw", "mIwm8NGgUR87lHrdXHQ3rg", "29iHfQysJu-a324U0uV8yw", "a4G3TONJtiL3FvnwRUV05g", "fZaWWxwwHGtH-8Vhx7qE_Q", "cNkykJO6ToQiALs_fogI8w", "ciq8BBW1fjdo_2FfS5kFAw", "9E1ZgRNi2F9SM1WAFHj0DQ", "24uDtsT2ItNHjQG9s5jh5g", "wGlFBrs8B1J8bCeAjx7q-w", "HZ8T5hogUEmY86-zCVLwKg", "ioRG1N4D1goK4HseXXkKsA", "P36J7o10_YSIywaWX9YjCA", "nDxdIakvOD1RP-qIPEdXSQ", "TATK7JhmINXt3ShXEI2D-Q", "L_Pzod1xZTpkl534gqkpiA", "8J5IviWeu2Hc9ccvFGSYCA", "RTQ9HEPfrUrtwSDtzY1cKg", "6WTtnegZdbbrSdp_7lsk9g", "i9sIWJoQAvjvWECR67b-QQ", "kdjgtsaeNurC0OX9O4CyNw", "q9b6ReEc--F_M-elUfxwSw", "rZg5xWm--gdr6LiHoqe_AA", "ABLR75XWwZ__ogztTRU-gQ", "kBQk0NrIKuC7ummi2WNJqg", "UFeO9CvM7zkpK0IH6tsY4g", "KFV9jDa1Lb36nZ5MGcrVcQ", "RoE58wNtlEmzd-kgTzQKhg", "lRvVaSIPosTTbOYFC3HPAg", "ZCJ3Hk1tGRUrf4Z1fo9cFg", "KANwrGfsU0Y6EZMTg_Rg2g", "FFP5vcAhE60SGqsluvvXVQ", "plaAwbdAV_kua1K2ztZHVw", "fsJIbcJf88cKKQU06lv6iQ", "P0wENWX4LNg84G-nsqcGFg", "Yqrn6a5c8lhpllL4nkldwA", "8x9mZtqdfbhoy8aoBpkB4g", "3u0Qmj5VnjC2BOvgDsg_8w", "Jbwvnl64HPBseSynnceeAg", "DPnFw5eOsSOeWBymXgTeww", "I0ezkVvCcBnavJf2soWHjA", "zHN5zaszgP4y2PD2O9b9oA", "IjMqP31a1ncQEU88zWr5Ow", "mHjbNKpJaAcyElR12sP6lQ", "JBFS8plYMBW6NmCswpLFlg", "QA7IaX81E4lAR7D60zObQg", "B1fy4noPdAsk3BMJckWvMw", "8RFa8H_qkbWyRTQ9ecx7mA", "VO374rMu6c7is1_CIcfbag", "_mYOAnfgrL2-7ezJxh5M2Q", "AYQGK2AZkIPkrqgAb72Qkg", "yScJXAY4A5rRJrxVOYEEcw", "2JIxJTfb8KIivUrv9MExwQ", "2wA3hhwnnT7kfYOYosrb_A", "hUZgKznyIJjAK3JJ2DPx8A", "pBHOGICe9e1bOcMjbQoONA", "s9DD4l3J9t_bYEVztJVcTA", "j-4A4PnrKGCyjVgkb598ng", "QRUCiW1LwtHiRDjorK3UHA", "nXqkc3hlTwFGDzWqmU5nlQ", "XXTPILp6EsH7DfBKfuAglA", "Cp8Dplz2yBwYAMFL99vlKA", "owQqWfiEnsHGJIcrzDJ_Xw", "coZij58dCHAUVGFyxrBrHg", "qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ", "PCTpEXyUif_-Ak8c4aap3w", "8fplxDoE06YTwMSkLGKNmg", "snfg5hrEoUVYwkD4IcKeuw", "NMOxipsnXc6olWdHYzXiYA", "OqSr2xL6S5qDMGuW3iZz8A", "GIK3ZeadxsC23viJZXq3Mg", "YEz8qEbmoFkp3dOFeDUPbA", "CIZGlEw-Bp0rmkP8M6yQ9Q", "okNTdZixJh10W8v_Njeu6g", "IpLRJY4CP3fXtlEd8Y4GFQ", "TOtCT6RbDCALsfcM_Pqe8w", "5fowB3w0KMisJsS9r1s7sw", "0WaoLtB2BTcKH8u4KlESKg", "IaX73WNkQtspGsF3Xwgm8w"], "elite": ["2011"], "average_stars": 4.05, "fans": 2}}

And it's only appropriate that a coffee shop brings me back. La Colombe, in a word, is fabulous. While their cappuccinos do not feature the perfect combination of espresso crema and milk froth to create glorious \"latte art,\" I still gulped a couple of these drinks down during my three random trips to Philadelphia. The espresso was not bitter and the milk was just rightly sweet. I couldn't complain. Their large mug of coffee is great too. \n\nRelax - coffee snobbery is not all THAT rampant here. The lack of a menu (which tells you that you are only allowed the classics - the way it should be done anyway, frankly) balances out with the OK espresso shots. However, if memory serves me right, the shop uses a La Marzocco to pull its shots (WAY snobby, but in the right way).\n\nMy favorite thing about La Colombe, though, is the atmosphere. Large windows are placed opposite a warm dark wood interior, which truly provides a world that is the best of both. People-watching is a definite do here. True characters haunt this place. One time when I went, a scrubby young man, who had just seemingly finished smoking his cigarette outside, came back in with the stub of his cigarette enclosed in his hand and jacket sleeve. Was he trying to create some sort of hot box in his sleeve? Beats me. Weird. \n\nI haven't even gotten to their cups. They're gorgeous. Cappuccinos are served out of beautiful sets of cornflower blue and maroon Deruta ceramic cups and saucers. From what I hear, they're custom-painted. Some of the tables in the cafe even feature broken pieces of the pattern. \n\nIf not only for the pretty good cappuccinos, you should try La Colombe just to see the cafe itself.

My days started and ended with La Colombe's cappuccino, enjoyed in either the Rittenhouse Square or the cafe itself. I've found only one other cafe, Cafe Trieste in Berkeley, whose cappuccino matches La Colombe's.\n\nAt first, I only studied at La Colombe. (To be honest, I still haven't found another cafe where I feel comfortable studying as I had at La Colombe. Must be something about their seating...) As I became a regular, I found myself drawn into intriguing conversations. La Colombe remains my dream cafe: an excellent team of baristas serving great beverages to interesting patrons studying, reading, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, and engaging in witty conversations.\n\n******************\n\nIn reading the reviews thus far, it seems there has been plenty of coverage about the coffee but only mostly negative feedback for the cafe. So here's my lowdown. Decide what you will:\n\n*Opens and closes early: 7am-6pm ish. There are usually a handful of people already waiting at the door before the barista is ready to open. On the weekends!\n*The baristas are amazing. The best I've seen anywhere. Incredibly efficient and fast! It helps that most patrons are regulars and know what they want. If you become a regular, the baristas will remember what you usually order and ask you if you want your usual. I varied and hence they never presumed. However, I've seen them notice regular patrons standing in line, serve up their drinks by the time the patrons reach the bar, and off the patrons simply pay and go. It reminded me of a well-choreographed dance. Tip them well if you become a regular. You may get free beverages and useful connections out of it.\n*The baristas are all very attractive. They are all people who've other lives, for which networking at La Colombe comes in handy. They know who's who. I consider them to be, to some degree, involved in the weaving of a particular Philadelphian scene. They've never snubbed me. I've never seen them snub anyone. They've always been super professional and discrete.\n*There is no menu. Can be intimidating for newcomers and those who like to know how much things cost. Order what you've liked elsewhere. The baristas will make most drinks people would ever want, and they'll let you know if they do not make/have a particular drink/ingredient. Just don't ask for soy milk. Skim is as far as they go. Remember, you're at a cafe owned by a Frenchman. Don't balk at the price. It'll be worth it.\n*The iced cappuccino is crack.\n*In terms of food, they only offer a limited quantity and variety of pastries. The almond croissants are fantastic. Less a fan of the scones. All can be gone by midday. There's a day (Mon?) when they have no pastries due to logistics. The baristas don't mind at all if you bring your own food. The regulars can be seen eating burgers from Loie's next door.\n*Only cash.\n*The place can get packed. Then, take your drink to go and stroll through Rittenhouse Square if you were planning on lingering. Or ask someone if you might share a table. People have always been obliging. Then, table hop when one becomes available. I've spent entire afternoons table hopping to my preferred spot or from one conversation to another.\n*I tend to see two types of patrons: those who want conversations (i.e. are networking/socializing) and those who want to study. If you plan to study, don't sit near the front. Sit as far away from the bar and door as possible. Generally, although not always, this is where the studious sit whereas those who want conversation, the regulars, choose tables closer to the bar and the door. Invest in noise cancelling headphones, although they'll block out the music but definitely not conversations. If you're an attractive woman or man who comes regularly, the regulars will strike up conversations with you sooner or later. If you don't want that to happen, good luck.\n*The baristas and the regulars are characters. Interesting to get to know. Consider yourself warned.\n\nLa Colombe Cafe off Rittenhouse Square can be more than just a cafe. Your experience of La Colobme, ultimately, is what you make of it. I chose to make it one of my networks/a scene. Those who prefer otherwise need not. But I do hope you'll really appreciate its contributions to the vitality of Philadelphia.", "date": "2007-07-25 06:19:43", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "FleKL7VuzfB9-oLT7YjxUg", "name": "Happy", "review_count": 109, "yelping_since": "2007-07-25 06:04:32", "friends": ["5KDScSOM0BSm0o5A8mZWQg", "DRpN_kT3saOiFkNJOD3LXA", "qVc8ODYU5SZjKXVBgXdI7w", "5F4MyQ8HrWOscQJDWKmoEg", "9LNW7PCV9bXwb7SiU6Bv0Q", "9CPjldVBiMLPEkggSUzOpQ", "l7xatkBieP2okLKfqOrjww", "74DWdS-iMZ-1H86ZT8MM1Q", "DGszSnRNWoAOtD8WGf9wpg", "3-t_uaPKVQQmOUAIu7C-PA", "JbQnuMvo0NdlKVWIn-3wIA", "u7ZMdq9RmLIc5mhpZ9YJZg", "vqxPzelXY4QPTEcW983-lA", "OKZ0w2QuUqeoFBLNw0vpOw", "tkN5wyxImFKN-CnfpQ2LGQ", "OKepNICCu0WhVxY4cTfwVg", "XN7gmypk2antDlllPKFgxQ", "lxwLSuihz9owishmiu5ojQ", "WYXwfxdHoPyJPbEfhGC83g", "Dlo9MJlx6WVPWy_sL9L_XA", "rcBksQNmJH-KRmLperzn_A", "v-HcprOKPC1_F5_15t4JDw", "r48HEAVYxURXzUXVp0-MIg", "y1B1eZzZ6qP_yz2Tom7yRA", "3M-2GS2eWVozHADXzU49CQ", "MpOMfaq4ikuhmFqj2tJx1g", "4c476nX33LrEFvtNToF4Ow", "MXkmcIkCeMUbxXp3xiSzmQ", "UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA", "VgCFRKlepyMAWA-t0lzS6w", "bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA", "NJkvRlizBu-OyGQ52tLS0w", "B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg", "q-m5ihnO-qHtal5tDGYC5A", "weqC4t_LtNyu8PnOmTIZPA", "bx6AcusVzV17KMX8i5J2XQ", "hcfNvTM43x9ZZ8QqHJPbkg", "w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ", "mPmbOkH3NxXbdoJ-lejjzw", "OG3fmkNktn-uq2txTc2hiQ", "RjQkoF8llTiXoO1bc4gOMQ", "MrpvV8fjhm3tBBjhmZP7EA", "ZEc0-R55zIQdKrVzkO99NQ", "dUzt4saw5wb7a2Os1kX1VQ", "MuhUC0v3qBBTj6D2DO0H_w", "ruwTuM09-jVWMT9YROLgMQ", "eKRZ3GqAARhgU_JoL7kxAQ", "dDHiYfwOvzOkp53E1V_fTQ", "cjotiAHFSbFuvbxTWmGi1Q", "v0JtfrbTDNPvSp3rXv8IRg", "cAmd-fttNSq-8zgreIy2YQ", "Sa9F3vbq7pUx5kfWO57YrQ", "2aJkurDqDtVcGBsuAmeUfg", "oWIQMZUltpvohmQ8_zMmyA", "j_P1wbNmK0uBo7LBv_Teag", "_f4VFhCR746xhnsmxlcmLA", "JE2pyEew6XtQxZojRNmbKA", "rkflAeoDFEUguQdsTbizuQ", "4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A", "pgI7gBPhuVmrCgzP-YSh9Q", "KI-9yFtnX0xKjR0810nJjg", "gm_1Sjihr_BQgXT20MsD1g", "0oFwsICNyFoQFwGTpe19Vw", "F9tOE0d09SLkCIZwt8I-0g", "0-nqab5ZBwS2KszYzlzF3g", "gReqm4q-A-vfsAgicBsbtA", "OuVm8cGPE_RKfCyDQ28Bag", "BUMeksFMG-B4uaJ222PsSg", "GrrmKyXBvX7bpkUetV9JNA", "GGWjA8v479feCo6OPTLQOg", "6s-g2vFu12OemhiK3FJuOQ", "Hh7GQIAf3m9ONiL8bGz9sQ", "7XYqRpVb4eASRF1D--hE0w", "-9-7rfnAhekgWTH_wmXvrQ", "cGa4vDjLuXMZSUaWvnmlqA", "6DC0wklyCCirKpglOOCyow", "txcuW6vtUxQIermk89QuIQ", "ij7kqaoPR_Zwtcrxn11kXQ"], "elite": ["2009", "2010"], "average_stars": 3.86, "fans": 40}}

It is 2013.  It is real life where I am a girl who gave up on the feeling of ever being sufficiently caffeinated.  Long gone are the days when a simple cup of coffee could give me a flutter in my heart and some gas in my tank.  I know caffeine is a drug because it used to make me so high and by high I mean euphoric.  It is a legal drug afterall and boy was I an addict.\n\nNowadays, I settle on just functioning with a cup of coffee and Dunkin and Wawa are acceptable means to an end.  I haven't felt the surge of caffeine in years, but this week that changed.  On a quick lunch break, I was treated to the presence of Aaliyah P (who delivers a burst of energy to all who surround her anyway).  She bought me my first cup of iced coffee from La Colombe.  I was happy to see simple syrup and all sorts of fun additives to make an already cup of iced joe better.  \n\nBack at the office, I began to feel something.  That flutter in my heart that left me in my early 20's after all my all-nighters came back to me.  I didn't know I could feel this way again.  And of course, I needed to feel it again and again like a true addict.  So 2 days later I went back and found myself in a blissful state again. it only cost me $2...I'm done for.  Sure, this too will pass and I will become numb again, but for now, I have found my liquid joy again. \n\n*Apologies for such a dated reference, but I just recently got cable and learned that Friends is on pretty much any time of the day.

Robust, full-flavored and without the inherent bitterness of a major national coffee chain that will remain unmentioned........you can buy coffee beans, either relying on their standard \"house blends\" or turn to their more experimental efforts at new and textured blends. \n\nI hit this place on the way to work, getting my lattes to fuel my early work processes.... the line can be 20 deep, but the servers move with lethal speed and courtesy, and that twenty-person line takes less time than a five-person line elsewhere. Could it be because it is about the coffee?  It is my understanding that the founders have restored a way of roasting coffee beans that maintains the robust flavor, but removed bitter aftertastes... which explains the range of choices, explains why their coffee is featured at numerous restaurants in Philly and why, as they expand their network of shops, they continue to succeed.  I have the fortune to use their coffe shops in NYC and in Chicago due to repeat business travel, and marvel at the clarity of continuity - great coffee, efficient service and more great coffee.\n\nAs a sidebar, their coffee is sourced by the original owners -  and they work to source through fair trade practices, thus allowing me to serve this coffee at home to my Quaker wife, for whom fair trade practices are essential...\n\nDid I mention that it is about the amazing quality of coffee?", "date": "2015-12-23 19:08:36", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "qdow-tkbM0CtZa6My8NDFQ", "name": "Eric", "review_count": 12, "yelping_since": "2010-08-02 15:03:43", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.79, "fans": 0}}

Yes we italian are much less cerebral than here in US where you can write book about coffee. We just go to a bar for a good espresso or cappuccino prepared quickly. Here it has become (no judging) a ritual.\n\nSaid this I did try the Bodhi's and Spruce Street 's espresso, in both places  the time to wait for a coffee is unbelievable long, price outrageously expensive. Maybe the trendy and very expensive  Stumptown beans are perfect for hand poured coffee but certainly not for espresso I can tell you this much, those beans are way to bitter. \n\nBottom line La Colombe offers the best coffee beans for espresso and cappuccino prepared in a short time with no wait as many of my italian friends agree on. All baristas there are top of the line and I am talking not so much about the decoration with the foam (they are very good of course) but the efficiency and fast service they provide no matter how long the line is. \n\nFor what regards the owners of La Colombe I honestly don't care much of what they do with their personal lives as far as they run a good business !!!\n\nIn terms of dates form  roasting he is correct , coffee should be consumed within  2 weeks from grounding but with the big sale they have I don't think  that is an issue and even when you buy coffee in Torrefazione in Italy they don't put the date.\n\nOne last point if you make homemade espresso you know that coffee machine should keep a little residual of coffee grinds. As a matter of fact when you buy a coffee machine in Italy they always suggest to run for few time to condition the machine.\nI hope this was helpful !\n\nPaola C.", "date": "2012-06-02 13:54:05", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "SIiaAU4V1OvOVthJVHumxg", "name": "Paola", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2012-06-02 13:53:18", "friends": ["Xoe11-n2JFYUKjqARD4yjA", "GCJBMMZzdoxS-seyEysE5Q"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 5.0, "fans": 0}}

Hence the 2 star review. I feel like this \"coffee shop\" is set to attract a certain type of person, which I am definitely not (which may be the point). It's definitely not what I think of when I think of a coffee shop. A better term here would be \"coffee bar\" or \"coffee themed restaurant\".\n\nNow don't get me wrong- I know plenty of people that love this place to death, I'm just not one of those people. I think it's appeal is lost on me.\n\nAnyway- everything here is expensive. The food is small for even coffee shop portions (think Starbucks-esque, although Starbucks really isn't a coffee shop to me), the taste of the food and drinks is pretty mediocre, and the customer service can be pretty standoffish / leaves something to be desired. There is no wifi- which I wouldn't mind if the food and drinks were great. That's how other coffee shops get away with no wifi- they have other draws and perks! \n\nBasically, I feel like walking in here means you are going to be paying for the 'experience' and feel of the place. Not for the taste, but for the perfect Instagram shot that you will have to use data for because they don't have wifi.", "date": "2016-08-20 12:19:23", "useful": 6, "funny": 9, "cool": 2, "user":

I went on a Sunday, which I know can be extremely busy. I placed my order and waited. I see that a couple of people behind me already had their orders made. No biggie, maybe their drinks were easier to make. A few mins past by and I'm still waiting. I went up to the counter to make sure my order was not mistaken given to the wrong person or misplaced (it happened before) I asked nicely but the guy with the handlebar mustache rudely and rolling his eyes said something that was condescending to me.

You actually see people all the time just wandering around inside looking to sit down with their stuff yet no one moves. I don't know how, but this place needs to find a way to put some kind of limit on how long you can sit at a table. If your at the counter that's one thing I guess but come on folks, make room for others.\n\n- The baristas have zero interest in being friendly, you are there and they could care less to smile or offer friendly suggestions, etc. They take your order and move on, no thank you, no have a nice day.  I get that hipsters are all tortured souls who generally want to discuss the terrible injustices of this world in their tight jeans, flannel shirts and boots but come on, your in retail - FAKE IT like the rest of us had to or get a job somehwere else but this is the fault of the mgmt team.\n\n- the pastries, I have given this place a few chances now to wow me in the pastry dept but nope, hasn't happened.  I've tried their scones (dry and not flavorful), their muffins all have crumble on top, how about some variation??? \n \n- I know that La Colombe prides themself on legit good coffee but when you get into the latte and cappuccino realm please add flavored syrup to the mix as an option.  Plenty of organic coffee shops in the city make their own (Plenty on Passyunk as an example), even if you just offered vanilla which is nothing but vanilla beans steeped in simple syrup, people would be very appreciative, trust me.\n\n- I have been in line plenty of times where people were confused about how to order their coffee, maybe something hung up would help them so that it's less confusing.", "date": "2015-02-09 22:13:40", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "oWHif-LSkZIc-jj4vTF0lA", "name": "Penelope", "review_count": 32, "yelping_since": "2013-09-26 23:40:16", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 2.58, "fans": 2}}

I heard this new beautiful space just officially opened a few days earlier and decided to try it out for lunch with a friend.  \n\nFirst off, the space is incredible.  La Colombe has got the aesthetics down. BINGO.\nEven the men's room is more stylish than most restaurants around *see photo.  \n\nThe lunch was good.  I chose the Porchetta sandwich and it was wonderful.  Their baked bread on the premises has a great affect on the menu.  My friend's tomato and ricotta sandwich was on a beautiful sourdough roll that was light and puffy and just the right amount of chewy.  She noted, however, that the filling (very tasty tomato and ricotta) was about half as generous as the one on display, which seduced her into that lunch choice while in line.\n\nMentioning lines, it wasn't surprising that the lunch crowd had a long line.  It did seem to move pretty quickly and hopefully more smoothly once the staff get their sea legs.  There was an over-all feeling of being new drivers, just short of panic but far from relaxed and confident.  I know, this is maybe being too picky.  Our friendly cashier will be much more efficient once he figures where everything is on the touch screen register.  Until then, he can hunt and peck while I let my eyes wander over all the pretty details of this cavernous stylish den of hipsterdom.  I think this is the coffee-version of Fete Sau.  It's the hipster alternative to the frat-boy Frankford hall.

It's definitely my favorite coffee in the area & I would go out of my way to get first thing in the morning.

There were a lot of people behind the counter and everyone was kind of frantic which was bound to happen during the grand opening of a sought after business. \n\nOn multiple occasions, after my first experience, nothing has changed.

On many occasions, I've stood there waiting for my coffee while the 5 people behind the counter socialize and don't communicate with their coworkers to prepare drinks. After ordering my simple drink, many people who ordered after me had already received their lattes, macchiatos, food, whatever.  I've even contemplated reaching over the counter to grab my drink that had been sitting there, sans espresso shot, just to GTFO of there.

La Colombo coffee taste really good but I am not a fan of this spot. Parking is almost non-existent, you either have to park a few blocks away or park illegally. I typically order the same coffee, iced coffee with light cream and extra sugar (they only have liquid sugar) because I like my coffee sweet but it's never given to me sweet enough and that's ok which is why I taste my drink before I leave. Welp, I was immediately checked for tasting my drink inside the store and was asked to do that outside.   now I'm aware we had/have a mask mandate but I've also watched others place their order, receive their order and taste it before walking out the door so I didn't think it would be an issue.  Especially since I know it's never sweet enough to my liking. Why walk outside to just walk back in and request more sweetener?\nI've tried their pastries and they were very tasty and fresh.  The scones were good, I wasn't a fan of the lemon. I've have their breakfast sandwiches (bacon, egg and cheese and the egg sandwich) which are pretty big but I'm not a fan. I felt like my eggs needed seasoning, I personally needed ketchup, and I didn't like the sauce or whatever it was on the sandwich.  The sandwiches are pre-made. \n\nDue to COVID-19 there was no indoor dining, everything was to go but I'd love to come back and get a tour of the brewery.", "date": "2021-08-01 12:25:48", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "M7XPWbierjOgpEIA7zNpYw", "name": "Audrey", "review_count": 256, "yelping_since": "2009-12-30 22:49:16", "friends": ["uvnRoSD7a8LZnLmPieS3zA", "4s8EJ_GzGAqwdmFtHc2zjA", "_La2zuZhDN2XhNUeYKnBXQ", "WCcOhFu6sOY-lVskffpB1g", "t5Zn2Xbx3JFJIguLhjtIag", "qs6vWCfSobr9eH-bcOQ0Kw", "gB6VFWBgP2yyOC91OiFxrQ", "PfGiARmiJBo5DY1pOwGvuw", "_A50ck1lbXZdHqVmP2mjUw", "UaczFaLrDXZtxXpfOd6NYA", "bMr4WpQ4N5e2hAwxtZc-XA", "AZG-U4YAs1k_7vpXVpJD6w", "DtYKaSIuJwTMmhD_7JQC7Q", "5jgeOE9JZkJbH6chCKSGlg", "9rf4kk5icMkBkv2q-SXXxQ", "o_1a5xm0dBxHySHwrai6nA", "LObU6KzPZY9gA1l_QYTNdA", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "0WJFKtAqB-eQcRH_04PUWA", "Y2PVfJG-HNZL9leixmuapQ", "OrWmowLTQSuGsk28XVDKfA", "0xGf3NlkPuLeIOaIhyTqIg", "C6aY1JVfjPudswsIXDz_uw", "5wkw8oWWumsncnyfdH56qw", "w_7juUwAwIRt8P5Bhziwdg", "BmQkyaMdszSzUoUPai-d6g", "5gUfFKWI3gPdbEED3hO8Jg", "l4iQ8z7Q6PFatFx_UUMpCw", "CpkdLBHDEErM6oMRKth63Q", "xbaH3FXNeoZL_CPcVuoCug", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "PWfAwKh-1Yc5b6S2t6Ksdg", "m0yOS2VDeP6PQ-JNm-K_kA", "UZOm2svtUK-lGt4oTvh4LA", "1czfDyA7_qX02ObsdA5O6g", "gXH9jUZcvQT6UlEIQx-T-Q", "qcP2FVh19GBiDcXmdoFTTg", "L3lpkRQ0nH4VIclkEr9cnw", "cUKQEARhB6KAWCCLLpOZcQ", "8I7DLn7dPu76HQImdoqzQg", "6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q", "yK7TE9YZjjoktQcLkYkrEg"], "elite": ["2021"], "average_stars": 4.02, "fans": 6}}

Let's talk about the good stuff first... \n\nThe artsy Fishtown location feels dominating and towering inside, like a large night club, but guess what? It works phenomenally for coffee and spirits! It's a breath of fresh air, compared to the average miniature coffee shop. \n\nAfter eating a chocolate chip muffin I decided to rob the place. I went to the counter and said, \"Put all the pastries in my bag\", \"and put whatever doesn't fit, in your organic cardboard boxes\". They stared. I frowned. Back to my seat. Yes, they are that good. \n\nI'm always impressed by the coffee selections, they live up to the unique descriptions. The fact that you can also get coffee been brewed beer adds a bit of fun and creativity to the menu. \n\nFeel free to skate around this palace and gauk at shiney espresso machines and beefy beer distillation machines... fancy-shmancy glam. You will find yourself surrounded by gigantic wooden doors, and bakers-a-bakin, I feel like I'm watching an Amish farm operate sometimes. It's very interesting. \n\nSo far, so gooood... but then, disaster strikes.... \n\nLA COLOMBE HATES WHIPPED CREAM... \n \nThey don't have this heavenly coffee balancing foam anywhere in the vaccinity. I thought to myself, are they a cult? What's going on!? I had to double check my surroundings, as I tripped over a little bit, I had to make sure I wasn't accidentally inducted in. I almost cried when I discovered this. I begged them for an alternative. Creme fresh? I don't know.. You can't mess with one of the best things to happen to my mouth since, ever. You might be the new coffee mob boss on the block, Godfather Colombe, but you can't mess with the Diety of the whipped! You're a whipped cream athiest. But I still accept you.. \n\nOk, so I'll forgive you (cringing) for that. But should I get over the fact that your baristas seem like they are best friends Juno? I'm not the only one who feels like this btw. Every time I visit I feel like I'm being taken care of by a mr. or mrs. hipster neutrality. I noticed some batistas smile, but no one seems that cheerful. Maybe they need some whipped cream? But overall all the workers seem cool and smart! The waiters are the nicest of the bunch. The solution for more smiles= whipped cream. \n\nThe seating looks great, and most of it is designed comfortably (even though you will only find solid wood for your tush..) but I miss a comfy couch or chair to study on. Comfort is half the reason I visit a coffee shop. It's still here. The rocking chair area is very comfy. Just no padding for the tush... The Amish nod. Did the owner grow up sleeping on a wooden bed? \n\nHonestly La Colombe is half in the 3 star zone, but makes up for it by going overboard into the 5 star zone, with great coffee and more. So that puts us at 4 stars. It's a mixed feeling kind of place, a fancy palace to take your out of town friends. It's already filled with touristy flockers. It's exciting but different. \n\nThanks for the great coffee.", "date": "2015-02-06 16:27:07", "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "H7lVlSAtpaTzt7eqr63sJw", "name": "Noah",

The space is HUGE and seriously gorgeous. The attention to detail is amazing and I loved the chalkboard menus, wooden tables, subway tiles, signature mugs, and adorable globe lighting. Also, the Steve Powers mural is worth coming for, even if you don't like coffee!! It is huge and fantastic, and adds a touch of Philly grit, in the very best way possible. Everything is open, bright, and beautiful. \n\nAt around 10:45am on a Sunday, there was a line almost out the door, which was surprising, but not terrible. If I had been in a hurry, that might have been a little stressful, but luckily that wasn't the case. I also didn't realize that this location was going to have so much food! However, sadly, I tried to excitedly order the biscuit skillet and was told that they weren't taking orders until 11:30am :( what a bummer! That is way too late on a Sunday! I ordered a scone as a consolation prize, and while it was good, it was probably the smallest scone I have ever eaten. \n\nYou can get La Colombe coffee at many places around the city, and it honestly was never my favorite brew. However, the baristas here definitely know their product because my hemp milk latte was pure perfection. I wish they had some homemade flavor syrups, but that's just being picky. I will definitely be back to try some food, although I have heard they don't have wifi, so I probably (sadly) won't bring my laptop and camp out. I will keep my fingers crossed that they start serving Sunday brunch a little earlier so I can come back for that skillet!", "date": "2014-10-07 16:56:43", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "PGx_pmKGlmzK4Y_15IWAUw", "name": "Larissa", "review_count": 214, "yelping_since": "2011-11-15 02:04:37", "friends": ["N4hlX5_VmtuZXJj_lec_TA", "iHEBw4W18vPh_Ou0aZyfnw", "9KPEd4l0S-dlWiXWtthtrA", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "XiMjphpRsjC4jK8_4jYQtA", "E8oQvwTBrWSi3QYirIvf_g", "FUUEU3ZN5cL1nNNR2AYZuw", "t2LoCqGXkr5mPtu2a336SA", "IKbjLnfBQtEyVzEu8CuOLg", "C6BMLq3JmA7KHoo5gL6wFQ", "Xsim_eDuetehqeaH5S8Fng", "HETMfo2I479lYqHw-f00cw", "1bjo-xG3tKF5rQjRx5zW4Q", "Hnm89Cb5nNStyU87yHtEWw", "iCpwPcn6_6G5Pl2YqI3Dpg", "8qub8Ksqk0NFa6JfSioARQ", "WXGO7X5rcOBCnlNhHHUDpw", "gP20yP4taj8EKLdV-P-fzw", "rQ249HmFb6jEUewYhXOYUQ", "ojyWQJtQ_ESVDvqL-69tLA", "U_izQr3uKJuzEDStfIyK4g", "ojpVeGhAE41d60TzSUHyYQ", "Pk-dihlvXRaVfE65ghVOLA", "xc1opNkFCnAjsPXs7jqtfg", "qtHjaPduuF253zcPub1vVw", "1jPgw-rEGAv1g0UqvqmbsA", "bBd8sOgkhbaEeZHjczV8ZQ", "HHB1ZUmORfSoGOCTif9Dsw", "ydvEeTKXtZN0pIVxZHpJbA", "E4mm63V1BRjgWMvNJNvBBg", "eWz272mQDO02gtI5KFmsJA", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "X_fIunOzB1MAVy0tOCtllw", "WxjaXcRxL07hRVFdkZtoxA", "QN_GMcuVbPeafQrB4MxAUA", "ceM3ke4sxXUo6Y_TIoV4kg", "tTMzx3ysDQVofykmkKTf4g", "b1JJU_U5lBwvM0Pc2XyWLQ", "DCY3RCMBVzyLUhTCfFwkdg", "OKGg5VYzAO-rtfzmtRFgew", "ksBkzFRMOwtDiW7KMyEkYw", "UcY94Gch9_4Gi3px5gR4_g", "j_orXueAYJBft-VUNbs1IA", "IgNktOkIskMMgyUACntmMA", "RfMoBHB2-pdEw2pjpoMgTA", "TsUrs6s-4InzrgU22Bc7WA", "eAzEj3Qq6yvkbeTl4pGxcw", "P9hbcVoZIPKF4gV8KH427A", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "0148_ANrCwWbpgRCEM9X-w", "ajCBUlkRk7sdNqwIgvPh3Q", "VEsC22Y5RAdJyWrSfcSoMA", "UiRx8jyS6H957ItwFsP2nQ", "nnZc4F8ZykvL4mKRcH2M-A", "rUV1FUhji5xMjNBpcq5SXg", "DTNAb-1gJ6e2nyqCc3fdcQ", "HW-QgyCq4DzUQCFRaYn6Fg", "40YPBCW4IWxvgUMVgq78gg", "ZrarkxIF7BCb9ZCz797Zig", "mVkopn2FcSNOSrirL84v0w", "usEUv59McbXJ3sg-ZuTkZg", "EQpFHqGT9Tk6YSwORTtwpg", "Evb-f8pWtASrIsvqml01WQ", "VnpVYbyTWoBYqZ7nwWooag", "aISCSMvsLXamoguZy89h4A", "9ghfNfx6sGpK12RfTtpaVg", "z9sL9d4kfAiQeGJ1dGmBng", "9gurTp-5qaWQBOBw2lwYBQ", "9CspCs3E8tZnbsWWQD-wVg", "hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA", "kbaWzfIrsc9h3e9ROSD47g", "4o3Pfu6PPTlMSw2ICGyXIg", "6YV7qnyafpA4xTou1S9UcA", "5zJhxwEfEHpKFxMtKjPlvw", "uVO-bSLTjUPvBB4_tNb6kQ", "0eQr_XzEBFtF3i6kgF79Fg", "J1gc2iMG-xAF9GCxZvcdKA", "7vndEwoBACxaWi3r0AdYDQ", "F1V-YF-nHy1miIofqpwphA", "m8YprUGuAmGo0ANiMXRTcQ", "JtWh56v26oYf0VjjyWsS9A", "REnIBVutnk7CBmy8auVGqg", "cAK8y69d3jWip1k8Zrf5PQ", "SGPCLi-kVZ_pz1w7VJtkeA", "gkYMDZags2aJOVSst5k6xg", "dYEHTYJeDJ4v8AUiExaVsw", "M5YR5mhULixYjEsmVbPr9Q", "90U9Qgse46LfGRP3dGNOgw", "jhvreOViehq5zA4p2dgSVg", "V6R0djDaUBqSDEXPhEI6eg", "zdG-WWaGi6B1d_P6_3Q8sg", "6qHQKCUvOMlP7cvKCoTyWQ", "fCvMnJU1Z-XhAjKg99wK3Q", "1K5D_Ama82o0lUtT3t4JYg", "mzCGPZuzC9PdZsuNFyY04w", "cjoCsuzSVUIhJpuYMRUJ1A", "zZrmQwU7YS3b2UfhL7h2zQ", "Smyacwv0EHz451D_FfW0Eg", "UdziHTwpJLzE9BaBewmerQ", "wH5Lvc_K2gzCgi4jTx_0Og", "gwbu616L4XSH7mzKB-eD6g", "JQhOnIgDALdsXQkUwk7Z0A", "B9iPTih0dmpZn6fRyZnLLg", "Wo9PbIVqBtAbu6ZuiTfI6A", "nUcGHZkJQ1nohMPd36t5nQ", "ALehxcwDM8U1b02qbwKgOA", "kyI_3H0gY_HQ9Qv6ouzt8A", "a68fTwBqLwYDp80ZPQo4NQ", "AFLID_qyrrbEepehgVvbSg", "DBD9dnIV0QqVnPqjNKL0QA", "GUV6ayMvlkfUBeduJUUpEg", "9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg", "cntN1wM3P4LsL74E_ESrBw", "spz1yqOO2wKlyjcwpjwpZw", "8wQIoFapkegkC5fcVYg_Iw", "V1rial53zLecglzJl9cIMA", "ndTvomwHt_aePL9Bfc9QYA", "3WQABqoadQJoE_jADNNYHA", "BvgvWmOE0nKB-SZGmRc7fg"], "elite": ["2014", "2015", "2016"], "average_stars": 4.04, "fans": 15}}

My whole life I had been used to the taste of imported pineapples from Costa Rica (and wherever else they come from to end up in the Philly Whole Foods lol) and then upon having fresh pineapple in Hawaii its like an entirely different realm of flavors you never knew pineapple was supposed to have because you thought it was delicious before. \n\nThat is my complex and weird analogy to describe the absolute perfection that is La Colombe--if you thought you liked coffee before trying theirs watch out because this place will become an addiction. They make coffee taste like nothing else I have ever tried in my short 24 years on earth and the latte's DAMNNNN they're good. I would pay double for one of those because honestly they're that good (don't go getting any ideas now!).\n\nThis location is gorgeous and its really cool they have a full bar/some of the cocktails looked super tasty and I will need to go back and try them. My only beef is the no wifi policy, sorry I am jumping on the bandwagon. I absolutely agree that wifi changes the vibe of a coffee shop, it makes people selfish and territorial over outlets and space, butttt at the same time if I lived in the area and worked from home I can't think of a more amazing place to do it than at La Colombe.\n\nMaybe if they turned the wifi off on the weekends when its busier and had it during the week on off-peak hours for people who are working/studying, just a suggestion!

Especially when it opening here more or less gave an independent coffeehouse that used to sell their products in the neighborhood no choice but to close down for good (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-lola-bean-philadelphia).\n\nBut when one of the largest and most pristine coffeehouses that you ever did see opens up in a vibrant neighborhood spot; and features vices like beer, cocktails, and Steve \"Espo\" Powers murals on top of your regular cup of joe, sometimes you have to play devils advocate and give it a whirl! And even the people who harbor the most disdain for La Colombe like me have to admit that it's a coffeehouse paradise like no other once they enter.\n\nInside you'll find tables to sit and eat at with a group of friends or book club, barrel spots to sit and read alone, and plety of sections to catch up on some needed work. Whether you go to caffeinate with their coffees or impressive draft lattes, imbibe on boozy items like cocktails with their Different Drum Rum, or Tandem beer that they did with Conshohocken Brewing Co; or savor some impeccable salads, sandwiches, and desserts, you'l find it here and then some!

La Colombe's first location to serve actual food (not just pastries and biscotti) gives me hope that they will open up other locations in other cities. (*hint hint* San Francisco please!) Speaking with one of the food runners, this is apparently La Colombe's new flagship and headquarters (since they're based in Philly). Hence why this is a behemoth of a location (and I say that in a good way). As soon as you walk in, you'll notice incredibly high ceilings, cute vintage lighting, and a bounty of pastries, bread (you can order half or full orders of bread), and display sandwiches. They also freshly prepare salads, tartines, boards, and skillets (which looked amazing, but seemed a bit too heavy for a weekday meal). Basically, this is more like a restaurant -- you order food up front, they give you a number, and they bring it to you.\n\nOf course, their star attraction is the coffee. La Colombe's single origins and blends are mighty tasty. I ordered an early grey tea to be iced and that was incredibly smooth yet still herbaceous and heady. It was naturally sweet in some ways... so delicious on its own I didn't even add sugar (which I usually do!). \n\nNow, I took the subway from Center City so I could EAT. And eat, I did! I ordered the porchetta sandwich. And, my gawd, I wanted to delay my flight back home so I could return here for dinner. Sigh. Oh well. It was delicious while it lasted. Piled onto a fresh piece of baguette was the meat covered in roasted peppers (so Philly!) and sharp provolone. That was probably the wisest $10 I've spent on the entire trip. I especially loved every bite where I could taste the fat from the meat and the natural roasting oils absorbed in the bread. It was so heavenly. \n\nAs mentioned, this location is their flagship so you can imagine this store to be incredibly handsome in regards to its interior. It is \"industrial chic\" (if you wanna call it that): modern, sleek, simple, and romantically urban. There is plenty of seating. I will say, however, that like all (I believe) La Colombe locations, there is no wifi and limited electrical outlets. They probably think it's distasteful to stay in a store all day working on something and not clearing up room for patrons (which I get to a certain extent). That said, come here to read a book/magazine or catch up with a friend. Don't plan to study for your final or finish up that complicated report for work. I suspect the no wifi and limited electrical outlets is intentional so one can engage with the world and not just zone out on the computer.\n\nI used to be somewhat wary of La Colombe because their stores often felt uncomfortable and uninviting (I'm thinking especially of the locations in Chicago), but this Philly location changes my opinion. La Colombe: if you continue to build stores like this (with attention to comfort AND with the ability to serve quality food [not just coffee]), you'll probably have even more loyal followers.",

It's more than just grabbing a quick cup of coffee...or at least it should be. The space located in the ever flourishing Fishtown neighborhood is absolutely stunning! \n\nIt's huge, trendy, yet earthy. Vintage pieces perfectly placed give the space an old time, welcoming, homey feel. The greenery scattered about gives life to the space. The ceilings are so high yet the place feels so cozy. Amazing. Exposed brick and beams had me \"oohing\" and \"ahh-ing\". I love the industrial chic notes! Definitely take a look around the entire space. Don't forget to sneak a peek at the copper topped wood burning oven! It made me stop dead in my tracks. \n\nThere are so many different places to sit, catch up with a friend, enjoy brunch with the fam, work on your laptop, curl up and read a good book, nosh on drool worthy pastries and local goods such as Inspired Brews Kombucha, and of course, give into your caffeine addiction. This is a place for everyone. \n\nEveryone knows La Colombe is some of the best coffee you can get around here! It's worthy of a trip out of your way. The taste is hard to beat! If you've never had it and you're an avid coffee drinker...what the heck are you waiting for?! If you have tasted it, you know what all the fuss is about! La Colombe offers classic coffee drinks, hand pours, French pressed, single origin pourovers, cold brew, teas and creative lattes. They are always adding innovative products. Currently their mocha draft cans have the spotlight. \n\nMost recently I indulged in a triple mocha almond milk latte. It was made with unsweetened chocolate and was perfectly bitter. \n\nThere's a full fixings bar with everything you need to top of your delicious beverage including non dairy milks, simple syrups, raw sugar, agave and such. There's also a complimentary water station there with real glasses. \n\nThey offer a variety of pick up and go pastries as well as classic breakfast sammies, salads and lighter lunch nosh.  \n\nThe baristas are always overly friendly and extremely helpful. They know what they're taking about, offer service with a smile and create your beverage with care and much integrity, the way it should be, in my opinion. If you're overwhelmed with the choices, simply ask! They have great recommendations. \n\nThis particular shop is the largest in the city and has all the La Colombe swag your heart could desire. From tees to snapbacks, fresh beans, ground bags, fun coffee gadgets including pourovers, coffee table books, even La Colombe chocolate bars! So fun! \n\nI absolutely adore a visit here and think you will too if you haven't already! I only wish it was closer to home and that parking was a tad easier.

I think I was really lucky to have my trip culminate in this meal. Ben Franklin's ghost must have guided me there. I did pay respects at his grave the day before.\n\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy as well as a cup of drip coffee (Corsica). Everything - every little detail - from presentation to taste was flaw-free. It was The Best meal of any type of cuisine I have ever had and this is not an exaggeration. I love soft, mushy foods, and mixing the eggs, biscuits and bacon w/ gravy was just heavenly. The gravy tasted like nothing I'd had before - it wasn't repulsively thick or salty, nor did it look like a slop of shit-colored grime. I don't even like bacon but I gobbled up everything unreservedly. \n\nIt was so good it made me genuinely happy, like my serotonin-level-shot-up kind of happy.\nSo good I stared into the pan after I wiped it clean wishfully thinking more would materialize out of thin air.\nSo good I would come back to Philly just to come here again. \nSo good I could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. All in the same day. With my hands. \nSo good I'm naming it my Last Meal on Earth on my yelp profile. \nSo good I'm still thinking about it now, over 24 hours since I ate it.\n\nEnough raving about this dish (in this review anyway). \n\nService: staff were courteous, helpful, considerate. The confused look on my face probably betrayed that it was my first time there, but the counter girl informed me that the cute numbered tin holding eating utensils was for the server to find me when my food was ready. Coffee and pastries are picked up on the bar after you order, but hot dishes are served at your table. My server also asked if I'd like hot sauce or salt/pepper, which came in these quaint shakers. \n\nAmbience: immensely spacious, well-lit, industrial decor. Lots of communal tables which are good for groups. I sat by the front but it looked like there was more seating in the back, past the distillery that I forgot to check out. There's also a little area by the entrance that displays their store products like coffee beans, t-shirts, etc. \n\nOne thing I didn't understand about this place was the tipping policy. I belatedly realized I probably should've tipped at the cashier when I ordered because that's when I got my receipt? Or maybe I should've left the tip on the table? I didn't see my neighboring table doing that (or clearing their own table) so I was really unsure, which didn't actually hit me until I left because I was in such a blissful state.

Period.\n\nThe Fishtown location is grand and gorgeous.  It is a beautiful space with industrial aesthetic.  Lots of natural light.  It is a really relaxing place to be.  Bonus: Unlike most coffee shops, La Colombe has huge, clean bathrooms.\n\nOn to the coffee.  I had a pour over of the Panama Esmeralda Boquette Geisha made in the gorgeous Yama Silverton brewer.  Deliciously floral with top notes of orange blossom and bergamot with a coca finish.  I loved the coffee itself.  The coffee cup too was beautiful.  It is a chunky straight sided mug with a Turkish-style motif, but I prefer a thinner walled cup, myself.  Also, I didn't get the impression that the cup was preheated and the coffee cooled faster than I would have expected (likely due to the thick walls/thermal mass).  \n\nOne additional thing I would change is to come up with a better way of signalling that the drink that takes 5-10 minutes to make is ready.  La Colombe takes a lot of care in making the cup that costs $6-8 (pour over) and I don't mind waiting at all - that doesn't bother me.  But when my drink was ready and they called my name, someone else tried to take it and I had to insist that it was mine.  The barista looked a bit confused and the guy who tried to take it wasn't being malicious by any means, simply misheard the name.  That process should be improved a bit in my opinion.\n\nOther reviewers have cited pretentious hipsters working.  That wasn't my experience at all.  Everyone was friendly and super excited to be working there.  I was talking with one of the guys bussing the table about the drink and he seemed stoked and excited to try one himself.  Great people at La Colombe.\n\nFinally, don't forget the rum.  This location also distills \"A Different Drum\" rum with coffee and just a hint of sugar cane.  It is delicious stuff and made right there.  Check out the gorgeous still in the back.  I've purchased 3 bottles so far and it's a great value in my opinion $30 for a great local rum to sip is a steal.  It makes a great hostess gift for the right person too.\n\nAgain, I had an excellent experience at La Colombe Fishtown and can't wait to be back.\n\n\n\n*There are other excellent options on the East Coast like Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, Stumptown, too many to list in NY, etc. I'm saying La Colombe is at the forefront of the top tier.", "date": "2015-04-09 15:10:49", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "AEAWnaFdTMCkpThPV__rDA", "name": "Patrick", "review_count": 65, "yelping_since": "2011-11-26 14:48:19", "friends": ["iqPLgN0-cavlXQMHxWCwSg", "a2VwSY7kFDyP4oZMAQJLJw", "H5ng3pDFO91OTyJuQ3XgsQ", "a8IX3D6iFf0evtLQ3Y77Qg", "KfwRblc8PdomqbCwbbrfvw", "XxmuVzRrmTtn2I7H1aaS5Q", "x8dgw5HFxCJ6KBPnlkwYqw", "PiLR_Hhb_nO_5OMgZhxmzQ", "S35-qW5tnHc0BFsdGmKYMw", "Lejj3ya0VajMFnZ81fY5kQ", "tdDe2rQiO4MnE2X68Tz29A", "CxKE1f3SfJltlExKIQvoxg", "xtFnd1DaHYOfG2W0gQVeMQ", "uXhbnQQnBGtdbon95i1ung", "U_izQr3uKJuzEDStfIyK4g", "Jn3OE1M0muEgPk2pD57Ejg", "dodh2M1s6cD0ar-ugdS2Kw", "rS_Y9yO-YPJIVu6Gkqiv1A", "mj3uLnszQowjNAGWg-5m8w", "KD1giv7lykIFVcsfnO5c7Q", "Q70fqvLHrmCXT4h2yy5Tsg", "1bjo-xG3tKF5rQjRx5zW4Q", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "9wEZMCmuxJzbti6E5dZtAw", "ROfVzUVSCVYCEuUb3mvo5A", "K9dD_NWnEFo9f_pLw4weYw", "lAJ7O_QMTBmjdU1BrnrlOg", "Xgdo3Xnvw9d4z_AsMe1YzA", "aznc6Uj81-YKZpunSK97vg", "M1vCqM-fIlNK0O-S8wX5Qw", "LRGbf-su7W9cytkBFiyq1A", "lsOedh_YvuBcdTZlA981vw", "AbrXXgFEYhseMmLgTizO-w", "x3-a8cKOsKy1GkUEZpnCfA", "LbeHQ0frxP6sJew2fKZ8fw", "rPJdGMt0IWovg75IvF7otQ", "SViZa0ve_tmd3VvgcoRnfw", "NQ8_UxDV5PpYVhkaIsXhbw", "sOmZOGNi-MZnKc3PMHO5hA", "nk641iaI_MJNkI1FGG96uw", "k_pS6y0nOI_fehlTpgkmRA", "hNB1ucw7IM-9x_jlM0Mp7w", "fb8LIT2TWkJEPehhYrh42w", "Ga7i2zStNGS9ZUSwbsp7GA", "ToVkCKcYOl7XcWNiudHYEQ", "7Zx5DyQfVKWwJe1JiOJLUA", "hcJzh-FFDEfYKGpyM0TpZA", "Ak2avB80xaXxbCvsGpf8JQ", "0EkHRuR6Wl4tdRqC5awA0g", "Kxr2DuTnGnsrftFcl-mu_g", "ZTzItL5fqVVoQAAxaXYvxQ", "g7V7QTATU1gCxhLI-13AJw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "jAAj8O857nfe2pAKZU21LQ", "3IFm3r6iw9kbqNZ__SxSCw", "K6QHO-gaWV1cSkGkDN0lKw", "Z7G8Dkta3_XJSVYflnVYHw", "ZSOwbFE6oHd5_N5knsuLDQ", "g-wlE-TR3XSKhi7E0rjQTA", "86vahEyOUSmeP44lXqBrTQ", "Qk1vorkdAyBplhS8gcpC9A", "XXcTk2paS0iJLfmKUHet4Q", "fMMKkrR0V5WpDVlgxxCYJw", "ZMVTOsZj4u1Wpk00-DtJqQ", "IeAMKLVZE2hE56QfQR5CpA", "FOXVQ2xTXUOj8QXDp1fQqg", "l-M5V6zq4DM8YNbAVoPIjw", "lDB0FxGcj5BT78oGTfD-dg", "vNSuNgV8RmJ6AxOMl37AHw", "iimrGz7_ycDN0gXA49PVtw", "BSYEGPU4NmMjFr_dB8-T1Q", "lvKn4qNjq7gMyumNXjs8Aw", "vlFWDya97DUPFUckhba7dg", "wcZKQnA8TcMjRVb2Xr9_JQ", "Mm_yQWWK1lyuwct8AE7YZQ", "P_U_0IcijSE6gy4FXgJnnw", "g5qE_wx0P3EPFVUqX66dfg"], "elite": ["2015", "2016"], "average_stars": 4.23, "fans": 3}}

Their model and setup caters to making them as much money as possible regardless of the customer experience.\n\nThe place is chaos. You order your food at the counter and then you drift out into ambiguously walking through the crowded small space trying to man a table from anyone who is finally finished their meal.\n\nIf you don't find a table before your drinks are ready, which you won't, you are now standing awkwardly in the cramped corner holding a saucer, your coffee, and a little sign with your number on it like a branded cattle.\n\nThe \"we don't seat people you just have to find a spot\" policy makes for a mad scramble for the basic necessities of any dining experience.

We didnt mind the cold air every time the front door opened but others near us did. Something should be changed about the table setting as winter will be unbearable on that table!\n\nWe ordered the drinks- vermouth flight of 3 & the turkish green - first,  but watched it be prepared and just sit at the bar for more than 10 mins while our server attended to other diners and while the bar tender was greeting his personal friends. No one cared about the drinks or even think about brungibg to the table. When we saw our food arrive, we wanted our drinks and asked the server but she simply said \"oh yes\" but kept busy at what she was doing (no apologies) We saw her continue to wrap up the receipts for other diners; she could have easily signaled to the bar tender to get us the drinks, but no. So giving up I just walked over to the bar and got the drinks myself. That is a BIG NO in service. Then realizing that we don't know what is in the flight, the bartender finally walks over to us and explains (all in 3 seconds) the 3 vermouths. What frustrated us the most was that not one of them apologized for the delay! And, this is definitely not the Zahav/Abe Fischer experience; we have now been to Zahav about 30 times, and not once have we seen this type of service. They are simply impeccable there and even 10% of that attention and care here would be higher than what we observed. Btw, we also saw our neighbors' iced tea not show up on time!\n\nThe food was tasty but again not at the level of the other two restaurants and definitely not worth the price. We ordered the cauliflower (seasoning was great but the flowers were a little too burnt for my taste), moussaka (pretty in organization but tasteless without the little tiny amount tomato sauce), foie gras toast (very very tasty), persian lamb shank (great!), and the malabi (tasty as in Zahav, as the chef created this amazing dessert there!)\n\nI am not compelled to go back and would rather keep looking for a table at Zahav than go back here.

I think maybe they were making food fresh when you got there- my food was piping hot, but like, what's the point of pre-ordering then?\n\nBagel was good, I didn't realize it would be hot.  I think this would be much better cold- pickles were weird hot, floppy texture.  Messy as well, it was so hot the butter was dripping everywhere.  Didn't get as much za'atar as I'd hoped.  Texture/density for sure was light though, enjoyed this, as well as the seeds on top.  Overpriced for takeout at $11.  Fine if dining in.\n\nCoffee was fine, Ox brand which is solid.  Would've liked to try the Yemenite latte but there was no option for plant milk\n\nPistachio bun was way TF too sweet, but I should have known better, I usually am not great at sweets.  I took two bites and saved for my partner.  Definitely fresh though.\n\nI got the Zahav cookbook recently and decided to work my way through the Solomonov joints as I may.

I got the feta borek--or boreka with the Hebrew name--They seem to promote themselves as Israeli cuisine--The borek was delicate, and covered in sesame seeds which really elevated it. That addition made it better than any I've had in turkey or Eastern Europe. But the other three kinds of borek were not covered in sesame seed so I don't know if they would stand out as much. I would've preferred the rugalach to be fruit options too and not only chocolate--But for those who like chocolate it was very chocolatey. Though you can't just get one-they give you three. My husband gave the pistachio sticky bun 8/10. It was on the drier side, like Jewish baked goods usually are. Their bagel sandwiches smelled amazing and appeared quickly grilled and flattened (panini style) and covered in sesame seeds.

The problem with this is you can't ask questions about menu items, nor can you ask for substitutions or modifications. And you have to spend 10 mins entering in all your credit card info before the order is sent in. Very frustrating and not congenial to chatting with friends.\nService: hit and miss. Nice enough staff but rushed and not able to help with modifications to orders. Once your meal is finished you're encouraged to leave quickly.\nFood: A very limited menu, but what we had was good enough. Everything baked fresh in house. We went for brunch and shared a very large lox and cream cheese bagel.

While the AIP was not all that different from how I normally eat at home (mostly non-starchy vegetables, animal protein, healthy fats and very low glycemic fruit (once every few weeks), it was stricter. No nightshades, no chiles, no eggs, no coffee or seeds (sesame, cumin, rye, mustard et cetera), zero dairy, no sugar (honey and maple syrup are okay), no alcohol, no grains. The first week was tough and I felt lousy, but 5 weeks in-woo hoo!-do I feel one million percent better physically and mentally than I did 6 weeks ago. \n\nAs a treat for my Spartan existence and as an excuse to get a massage, a mani/pedi and some time in Rittenhouse Square's park, I ordered some of K'Far's Breakfast Bundles on line to be shared with a few friends for a socially distanced picnic. \n\nOrdering is very simple and if you don't have Venmo (I don't), you don't need it nor do you need to download anything onto your phone. You pick your items from their site, ordering starts every Wednesday, you specify the day and time you will pick up, your order is confirmed via e-mail and you are told to arrive at the specified time, call the K'Far number, give your name and your order will be brought out to you. Easy, right?\n\nI finished with my sybaritic activities a bit early, so I took a slow walk to S. 19th St. and called in to pick up. The patio is open for dining but it's tiny; however, you can order at their window, take away or eat there, assuming you can get a table. Of course, depending on your arrival time and what's been pre-ordered, some things may be already sold out. Everything was socially distanced/anti-COVID compliant with 6 feet markers for the order line, masked/gloved servers and runners and recyclable to go containers with no napkins or utensils. That caused me to have to text the folks I was meeting, asking them to supply that portion of the picnic, but I had no issue at all that K'Far didn't provide these things in my order. \n\nFor our picnic, I ordered the Boreka Bundle (3 borekas-potato, feta and swiss chard with cheese), the Jerusalem Bagel Bundle with 2 spreads (4 bagels and in our case, za'atar butter and vegetable cream cheese), a Mushroom Kubaneh Toast and 2 slices of walnut cake. My fellow diners were bringing iced coffee, fresh juice, cold seltzer and iced masala chai, though I could have purchased tea and coffee drinks from K'Far had I wished. \n\nI waited on the sidewalk for about 10 minutes for the order and enjoyed being outside in the sun and people watching. 98% of the people passing by and waiting to order were masked. Diners, of course, were not but if one had to go inside to use the toilet, a mask was required. A pleasant runner called my name, handed me my full bag of fresh, warm, fragrant food and I was off to The Square. \n\nThe borekas were just okay. We could see but not taste the potato in one. It was very flakey and covered in everything bagel topping. The feta boreka was light on the very mild feta. The winner, if there had to be one, was the cheese (kashkaval) and swiss chard. Stina, to our tastes, does a better boreka. \n\nThe bagel bundle was quite a hit. These are not your typical New York bagels. Jeruslem bagels are in a class by themselves. They are oval, covered in sesame seeds, and have airy innards. Not at all dense and heavy. The 2 spreads were marvelous and we couldn't decide which was a better choice. The cream cheese was light, not whipped, but not the dense Philadelphia stuff one generally gets with bagels. I won't say if anyone in the group used their fingers to get all of the left over spread that didn't make it to the bagels. \n\nThe Mushroom Kubaneh Toast is a rich, HEAVY dish. The bread is thick, tasty and holds up well to the thick layer of urfa pepper mascarpone and the heap of oyster, shiitake and mitake mushrooms crowning it. We all split this one order and doing so did not make any one of us feel at all deprived. If you order this and plan to eat it alone, consider it a meal in itself. One order for one person would be extremely filling. \n\nWe all ate to satiation then stretched, yawned, rested, chatted, drank our cold drinks and basked in the dappled, green light of the park before finally tucking into the walnut cake. 2 of the party expressed disappointment that I did not order the Pastry Box, to which I replied OINK OINK, but when we divied the walnut cake, it was unanimously agreed that these dense cake slices were an excellent and fitting 'after' for all we'd previously consumed. I love walnuts; in this cake, just barely sweet and very well textured, the walnuts shine. It was superb with our iced coffee. \n\nDon't get any combo of these bundles/dishes expecting a bargain breakfast. (The toast alone was $12-but rightly so...)

My friends and I opted for late night dining, as reservations for groups of 3 or more are hard to come by nowadays due to their popularity. Our server informed us that they ran out of the Harissa chicken and the sour cherry lamb, and my one friend was very disappointed, as he really enjoyed the dish the last time he dined with K'far. However, it did not really dampen our dining experience, as we ordered a number of wonderful dishes to share. \n\nTo start, we ordered the baked feta, the foie gras toast, and instead of dessert, I asked for the konafi as an appetizer. \n\nBaked Feta - The baked feta appetizer is a block of warm feta, served with a harissa sauce. The harissa is spicy and flavorful, but I personally thought that the feta was way too salty. \n\nFoie Gras Toast - Thick cut Kubaneh toast drizzled with sweet molasses and topped with scoops of cold foie gras. I'm a general fan of all things sweet, savory, fatty and buttery. This was a decent appetizer, although I think the foie gras would've been an even more wonderful pairing with the toast if it was served warm, rather than cold. \n\nKanafeh - This traditional melted cheese dish is typically served as a dessert. I asked for the Konafi as an appetizer, so that my dining companions would get a chance to try this before they got too full for dessert. Melted cheese covered in a crispy noodle-like pastry, topped with a beautiful syrup - can't get any better than that. \n\nAs for the main courses, we ordered the salmon, the T'bit, the freekah \"risotto\", and the ribeye cap to share. \n\nSalmon - The salmon skin was delicate and crisp, and the fish was cooked perfectly. The salmon laid on a bed of mujadara rice. If I was dining alone or with one other person, I would say that this portion is a bit small. I had no complaints since there was a group of us and we were sampling everything. \n\nT'bit - This is a comfort meal for sure. It was a rice casserole filled with braised beef and vegetables, encased in grape leaves and served with a bed of dressed romaine. However, I think the dish could've used more flavor, because I found mostly rice and not enough other filling in the dish. \n\nFreekah \"risotto\" - If you are are a fan of mushrooms. I highly recommend this. I love the texture of rice and nuts, and I loved the roasted pumpkin topping. \n\nRibeye Cap - I saved the best for last. This was my favorite dish of the evening. We received four portions - enough for each of us to have a sampling of the flavorful, tender beef. I highly recommend this. The caramelized fennel was a wonderful accompaniment to the beef. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered a malabi custard, as this is my favorite dessert at Zahav. While the presentation is more casual, it did not take away from my rose-flavored custard, topped with a sweet jam and almond brittle. \n\nThe kitchen generously gave us a wonderfully tart guava sorbet topped with fresh pomegranate and coconut shavings, as well as a warm chocolate babka with ice cream. We really appreciated the service and the complimentary desserts. Overall, I was torn between 4/5 stars. I would say this is more of a 4.5 star experience. I knocked off a star, because some of the dishes missed the mark a little on seasoning, and I realized that most of our dishes contained some form of rice. I'm Asian, I love rice, but at some point, we felt like it was a bit much. I will definitely have to come back for their breakfast pastries! Overall, I highly recommend K'far for dinner!", "date": "2019-12-06 17:04:22", "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "49sNJ1cHVRW4ao2tAUL9Ng", "name": "Heather", "review_count": 159, "yelping_since": "2013-12-16 19:43:04", "friends": ["KnapIwupWzJNhuctqS6ZeA", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "qRXzho4tGMCfaTQ5rSCMGg", "m0hD9jCbODAY85EuXubX7A", "ETyduRMWNWg7cjoZaRxmaQ", "WLCUnZe81ow9nUomvzTjlw", "Lz09ILwaAWY7JpVYmNejKg", "FsqJOu_F6b7SgKLTEfqNmw", "aYveEctPYcZiubXyEgLhTA", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "U2jYhav7yQrDNcBzF7-shA", "XEwEdPIjryudxfU098wapg", "fozmaIO8zGH8slx6nQ6VQQ", "kj-jdhOYqi85101EEu1kTg", "0jfo1oOZrOQqWuaVa7I5Lg", "S1-cbVcXw7PsW1GGl1H-xg", "Kc83B5StPPg60uMQWocT1g", "JW5W4OZCohTvZlRF1jzrTg", "3W_7WTPHIVZQ30X3iRosqw", "zYkVWyD8y5UeYy9ftMR4bA", "C2nzoqU60AcRPHpCBsEScQ", "Zk5ynMSlnr2J_MD2cvboSA", "BeaP4KMuAp7B3f9M4F2P1w", "iX1msXXgIPXTa6vZ6izCZQ", "Iw6uScVAE_MA7cHZey67yg", "WVX17kw7pvFEI1850XHB3Q", "Q611Y5ydgZYnk4pgnZ7K1A", "8jJRsddE0GuQzoflJUvsrw", "TYCkjEHPSJSnFb6m6GDluw", "YOgsaRbJdgk26SaMRsfWkQ", "cyao2TVBtV7BFbXYif4OJw", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "QpZzTJPjpb7hkaMW-8Btkg", "n11zpLA9HwlSZXUDWmINsQ", "-xotbvscTK8t19mittfplg", "3WsFCuXKTIq7F2I4s1cqjA", "uJS2StuC1c60-GvysgRIJw", "4DyMRBKrokax6d8LCI3GAw", "DPKicEgvQPBlltQS18IIiw", "hv-GtL9hsBqz8oM4vteGiQ", "ALDcKC7m2lkqyi4epHiL4Q", "tpeSrIFB-Ce0CjtTsRE0OA", "f3ZBI7v6aLOCecagnx3uMQ", "rvYTWj_twMGMkT3k7qjxZQ", "9qD3XymuGRuAPY5vQ4t7tw", "DkROl1HVp7Eseya0FT7HMw", "_0Ex4Ejuye_7i1mNOx9VUg", "Bvz7fwBLYUvL_MHv9dyuQA", "jcySPLd7FcJIK7XxB9MGlw", "_fdtM3igBsbiY5AUZWOn9A", "RYfI2Vn-jciQjwGGQ1EqIw", "pjz7LWbOmJIkYYP_ohNP-A", "KjrzwLV1rUOe9zkaQMEyzA", "TZ81odnerwNh8As6ZY214A", "4NKd6tVhMk-FDSymrLyOzw", "rpNiVCHbdbrUp2Uv6Hz3Pw", "Ho0K0HmxxLYVoDE8Z6PvLg", "BBS9DBqPOi-gCOouggS0rA", "xqjhgh6G_fd0l6FPeKrp5A", "4-9txixpw1HO6CLE6JniIw", "0ZUHtvIiZ1DPKKDTiieuKA", "_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA", "HJ_SmwokNAbASCaHGqpkfQ", "RQDrNv3GL4TXmaxgtYVs3g", "ehGymmVlTUqfdYjbbmknDg", "JR82soazzphEgujTysi5RA", "dyAaNxc4QGNxOIYz5uSy4g", "eLXZSVZMPyht_e2BcZJ6HQ", "l1mIHxWw72e8jrCT1EL26A", "jm04yFf7d3emeObNRZXTfQ", "qNe3E6lmFkRWUPULf8Zk1A", "lYbvFvVScx55DXAzgtKgLQ", "h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg", "x1ZeQbGxfTPZ2BM0VcWs9w", "8dXmIZsBUZkLKOfluz_tVA", "aY-XadvzBhn7JiYpeHoUJA", "2v_Q85GTYk-Vk984du1vaw", "71Fl9rLZjKvxG-rvIDWHvQ", "meff4yE5gLIYIXt4G6BPmQ", "MzSE2FYkf0yvfs6RZQsLaA", "GbqmA7Ul-vrLg4jPVkYq-A", "97hsPQexihsbo_TBdPw0lQ", "vA4i8IpY5a9tJm5cJmAOcQ", "FaZl4crcfk40_7EWx12paA", "dvUlYoV4TAjz73_8eNUz8g", "osbjp2tbW4ZvRQ5Nj0JWRw", "ZcogXYI50Ja_6b4CdEG_0Q", "ej7l_MJWku4OyR7J3dknrg", "E_x4CzmNPuw_oTUxC9pi6Q", "UwVpw19B7uDli1XZYJsC2w", "oFuZcJakXnNJinl5B6q77g", "sq83vuw42-6xj1eA5w1zJw", "FdjFiGT7Pd5gnpbCsB_7Nw", "IxZAHq3u6rhPJ7SIbVOoDA", "hfmGZCaWHm6tulJLtMeGKw", "Ij3niC7KJbEh79DvesKj5w", "_iHbovM6oCm3fTu8ZqTx5Q", "DYM6AOAyUjidkLPlUl2FBA", "t57qgkqcDzPAAwo0gnHmKw", "7nq09jiKpW9xw9J9iKUbpg", "eJnwyot0rLyWN84DwyC0RA", "XNudJHO9xBElglTwqzhh_Q", "es1nGse48iITXcrN2wMM8A", "ISmjF1SR9N5kUHtzdNzGIQ", "qzqE25Ao2KXATSIULKTGcQ", "Nr4TN9Va4XNJJagfwR5O_A", "3yWuLNDs7lU3ZQ3UdGWPog", "a76iti8_bcmch7Ryg8DYGA", "2yj_CBL02NJjAnfm-1FPvA", "PkCVlQZ-TZIMVW3b6gst2w", "q1jnNKFId6jp4ZpJ1BM9gg", "a1Udkkcv3d_x0bfh1xJLKQ", "tt2rIv7oYXEp74eB8H44kg", "w6j_t6mTdowrUYbyCMTxVQ", "AHzQ9mjS4dVrt4HJNar76g", "0irIz_H-bCI0vdrtIU0Bww", "ne2cdSWUOsxUYkDJmenO3A", "4QHeBFpOZlKH5DR989al9w", "eQO_uhZnqiViSCvGlkCmCQ", "TgvVRf96GiTGD2Tu2hdVeQ", "g1vlAzfCeeej5DC7A4F36w", "d4DkT_u9AB1cjjApA3bu-Q", "LDDyvHQZnIfbI4gOH2yjEw", "kowqnnKkSmM52t5k9844Fw", "DupMhBjXJlfD0dNLNVj8Xw", "Nybrrlne_DSBFwv8ii8tXA", "VZpjCWuY9i9gvL8o_YpjSQ", "olDkSXrmptzNxGdKstB9nA", "fn5ROagjNc3yTv3Ly7NkaQ", "ZFR1aPaMDgWbzsBkVEHxQA", "6kGPxGGnxUnVbwuxwZo6VQ", "jVpvkriRR4Q8iDukh4rW-Q", "0QDpvX-qoKoY0Q0O1IpaCQ", "XmJcAGI2llzAM7out6NVGw", "_3QqVu2w_hE5aZFsjdTOSQ", "Xlq9tTYooM6j138mhjCu0A", "iVV4Iy4JMxWkblY6U6wpkw", "BCLh3b7rLhmBp8N2YJ8pLQ", "-upGsCIwm4myrOOXs27fgw", "HsL6RTNL9s6QMqhkEs8dgA", "b6b96urpuW1_zuyDU8_kMA", "c7wQVxBb5zOCGJ63BK_I0A", "G5uSyQYRMf6ZZAm-o1EIMg", "diic4odrjgSAYXJYML-PPg", "248L-kERydnMF-6eRKkiHg", "L3lpkRQ0nH4VIclkEr9cnw", "ynOKdr3bfj9MvTwhfis2rw", "k5d5ot-QZC_EtDaZPaqn0w", "v3asYzSUsauvsP9sM4TqSw", "8I7DLn7dPu76HQImdoqzQg", "Y0J1pnv0iNwdaSj6lxPTHA", "g-r6NMt10NntVjIh-fGVFQ", "WuiEYopWZOWOuWQD87fVSw", "Hpf0XejkQAIMSsZhZyj-FA", "wY5st0AKEslRhZ0WmrB_9A", "Y4bk7__AE1LAZUnu4JMMsw", "TY9hIfzKOyAsSeRAl0dzVg", "tETv94Qcn4xrN-cd2vnjCg", "cg0PHgJXRk7s9cDyYDqJEg", "vBuJWKucb5WAS0QNNOgXkA", "novFMPBgjicGHqNW0LqMmw", "Y9zk7CS9txa_DCwC8cP89g", "5WZaN60UGBa6Lnf08ND6-g", "T4d7CIz7hrcVacpxDEFL_w", "BrLJ3COWZibG7SI3w5JdYQ", "PCLFneuAC0QNr_6aK4ntKQ", "Gbv1QXrhmTE378guN_2UAg", "wfz2mlZ2OnpdUpUOw0732A", "z_IpK1U0Dwm-aW38uBO5Aw", "3Xh8F-V4Ey2LfDY2WcZrIQ", "jZFRZj6gJrse9UDXaGyKvQ", "8VPCVY70TcE353gRruotWQ"], "elite": ["2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.83, "fans": 26}}

I read all of the glowing reviews for K'Far and happened to be in Philadelphia on a warm afternoon and decided to try it.  A lot of the reviews stated that they waited over an hour to get in but when we arrived on a Wednesday around 2PM the place was nearly empty.  We decided to eat outside.  The inside of the place was really aesthetically pleasing with a cool modern decor.  The outside was just a few tables outside and nothing special but we really came just for the food.\n\nWe weren't sure if they offered waiter service or what the deal was so I walked inside and asked the counter person.  She explained that they don't have physical menus and that you just seat yourself and scan the QR symbol, fulfill your order online and a waiter will bring out your food.\n\nWe put in our order but it was a bit of a struggle because the online menu service they use was quite buggy (freezing up, wiping out the cart, etc.).  However, after several attempts we were able to get our order in.  We noticed the taxes on the order were 18% and thought it was just another problem with the app so I went inside to ask about it.  The manager came over and explained that the Philadelphia tax was 8% and the ordering service charges another 10% which goes to them and is out of their control.  In addition they add another 10% service charge.  At the end of the day you are paying 28% between tax and service on top of the bill. \n\nThe food was fantastic and unique.  We were a party of 4 and ordered 2 Jerusalem bagel grilled cheeses and 1 Jerusalem bagel with smoked salmon and capers.  A Jerusalem bagel is not your traditional boiled and baked rounder.  It's a thin oval shaped baked bread covered in sesame seeds.  It's actually delicious and definitely different than anything I've ever eaten.  We also ordered an Arabic salad which was dressed perfectly and had a crumbled, soft feta that tasted like a cross between goat and feta among other delicious ingredients.  We also ordered a Kale salad that was finely chopped and had squash, pine nuts, shaved fennel and more....equally delicious.  \n\nFor drinks we tried the fresh brewed unsweetened citron ice tea and berry iced tea which were great.  We also had a coffee that was notable as well.  All in all, this was delicious and filling.\n\nOne thing to note is that if you sit outside like we did you may experience \"street people\" wandering into the outdoor area asking for money as we saw.  We also had a guy wander in and start yelling and cursing which made the experience a bit uncomfortable for everyone in our party.  I would definitely not sit out there again especially since it's so nice inside.\n\nThe bill after surcharges was over $76 so it was a bit pricey for what it was (3 drinks, 3 bagels, 2 salads).  However, the food was so good I will certainly return again.", "date": "2021-10-21 21:00:45", "useful": 9, "funny": 3, "cool": 6, "user": {"user_id": "uYV4fdoQeJ99vgY6_SU-zg", "name": "Glenn",

Immediately, the space is beautifully decorated and every inch instagram-worthy, from the marble tabletops to the millennial pink galore. There was a small line to order at the register, but it moved quickly and gave us some time to peruse the menu. You have the option of either dining in or taking the food to go, and despite the caf\u00e9 being somewhat crowded, there was enough just enough seating to go around. After placing our order, we received our pastries on a plate, grabbed a number, and found a table to sit at. Although this is not a full-service restaurant, I noticed staff bringing water and utensils over to other tables and patiently waited for the same. I debated whether or not we were allowed to go grab utensils from the service station ourselves, but after half our food came out and we didn't want to wait until it got cold, my friend and I just went up and helped ourselves.\n\nOnto the food itself, we started off with the Grilled Cheese bagel. It was delicious and tasted like a whole grilled-cheese-tomato-soup in one with the balance of flavorful tomatoes, cheese, and za'atar seasoning. The sandwich came warm, but I wish it were hot and melty since it should be served fresh from the kitchen. We also shared a Tunisian Salad which was very underwhelming. The salad arrived messily presented with four sad little slices of tuna. It tasted fine, but was far from special. We asked for olives on the side since I don't like olives, but my friend found that the olives were quite flavorless anyway. I would probably stick with the pastries here rather than the prepared food. \n\nNext up, my friend and I split a few baked goods. The Potato Boreka was fantastic, with a savory curried filling. I really looked forward to the Pistachio Sticky Bun which was delicious as well, if a tad oversweet. I was missing a bit of the pistachio flavor, but the texture of the bun was spot on. Finally, we split a Mini Chocolate Babka bursting with chocolate flavor and probably a good alternative to the little Rugelach which are much tinier and more expensive than a nice fat Babka. To cut the sweetness a bit, I ordered the Yemenite Latte as well. Disappointingly, my latte came in a paper cup despite dining in and was not filled all the way. The drink itself was nicely spiced though and just slightly sweet, very nicely balanced. Again, not hot but almost lukewarm and as a note: you cannot substitute the latte with non-dairy milk, whole milk only.\n\nOverall, the food and experience here were pretty good, but did not quite live up to the hype. I might return to try some of the other menu items like the toast or other pastries, but the bagels and salads especially are quite overpriced for what you get.", "date": "2019-10-13 18:06:38",

Honestly, between the service, the food and the ambiance, we had a hard time even finding a \"con\" for my usual list.  Just great all around, and we will be back to explore other parts of the menu!\n\nPros:\n\nService was honestly elite for a place that's price in the less-expensive range of Rittenhouse restaurants.  Quick and attentive, very pleasant to deal with, knowledgeable of the menu and on and on.  It's possible I've never had better service in Philadelphia.  At the very least, it's close.  We sat at the next to last table in the back and our service was extremely polite, helpful and attentive - really, she was top notch.  \n\nThe food was a great experience.  I actually found the appetizers far more interesting and indulgence worthy than the entrees and I'm tempted to return and just order those.  We had:\n\nWhipped Feta - delicious and light and the figs were fresh and enjoyable.  I wish there were a few more crisps!\n\nBread and Caviar - I admit, my wife used this as a backdoor to try the bagel, which was incredible and the Labneh was amongst the best I have (and I make my own Greek Yogurt, so I feel a little knowledgeable here).  The caviar was an unnecessary excess and I didn't find the saltiness necessary or interesting.\n\nFoie Gras Toast - Whoa.  I mean, I've had fois gras before and it turns out \"fat tastes delicious\" this this stuff was a revelation!   The Kubaneh Toast was an ideal and enjoyable vehicle - I only wish there was more!  \n\nFor Dinner we had the Lamb Shank and Crispy Salmon.  I'm not one for Salmon at restaurants but I had read a number of reviews here and it definitely lived up to expectations.  The crisp \"skin\" added was incredibly flavorful and worth the price of admission.  The Lamb Shank was perhaps  more typical but met our expectations and was a little less fatty than some other places we've tried.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the Rugelach French Toast, served piping hot which was a crustier bread or toast.  It was delicious.  We also had the Melabi and found it light and enjoyable, but the plum jam was the star - truly something amazingly sweet to mix!\n\nCocktails were also delicious and I found the Turn the Table to be terrific with just a hint of coffee mixed with my rye to make a refreshing but warm beverage.  \n\nThe ambiance is a bit new and chic, but comfortable enough.  For such a great dinner option, it's almost a shame the cram a bakery daytime experience in as well, but it works about as well as expected.  Seems too fancy for breakfast, but too much of a bakery for dinner.  That's probably more of a note than a pro or con.  \n\nCons:\n\nI found the drink prices (a few fairly expensive sours seem out of place and a few more reasonably places IPAs would have been nice) and cocktails to be a little high, but food was comparably inexpensive.  \n\nOther Notes:  We mentioned it was our anniversary when confirming the reservation and we were treated to complimentary glasses of champagne (I think - we did see another couple get the same thing) and it appears the kitchen delivered a complimentary appetizer to all a few minutes after they sat.  In any event, these little touches are appreciated and make us excited to return!\n\nConclusion:  There's a whole lot to like at K'Far Cafe and not just for breakfast.  (although, I want to go back and try breakfast - my wife insists its equally delicious).", "date": "2019-10-10 20:51:50", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "kaOV2JYS0-hdGm0ce3AIDQ", "name": "Justin", "review_count": 168, "yelping_since": "2011-08-27 21:08:06", "friends": ["JrYNyHy-Hq528gWniALlPw", "ZFXhzEEqmqa9lIsiKJ_hAw", "9ZgLTK1jIsR5w62IRooXOg", "afDlnKEpvSaGAv8-m5j8xg", "Got79Ky6qDziQUxLtbgfhg", "ae-lyPURPNUZzSJ3MDSk3Q", "2j-B6RhNPvSs-3QNX5pXmg", "xlpQkwC4DTwxiKrckSCxug", "qJicjPge6Xe5M1d8HqHktg", "56SJgszuEW9bN6pO7j1AFQ", "6oviYs56sZPwVo4zokg7jQ", "NLdj8ORLa5AOtwfpfNcETQ", "NOqXzH3jCxKHHToEeSC-Ew", "q5tAod0Ze9QakODtOCvlzw", "wmCAsdwYjuTS4GiRizdVeg", "AuxHgLcPzgMcu0D98_OiSQ", "1WVneK5FPrj9Lm6vhN0spA", "oYmsWt-zArrtbnxJ3XwvSw", "7oK-QW_2TbFJIUKHIoNAgw", "7SXrvOXJLoo3TqUutAZn_w", "vN8_Fcbml_vjr-zCNQQanQ", "sP8AeikHC_2yWWYJ_p4Hqg", "NLd56svaPL7L9fYw0LMw3w", "BpjXX7V5To-bYSbr0vYQgg", "9AqpdsV56Wl8vhJuD7k8jg", "ZHb9Ud9IOAcceimiTyLGVQ", "soTD5yFcoZFAO62b9UnzAw", "ycdfGZHO7WTid_Ywk9-AYg", "VH70XtPxjMxImYmuqZy8vg", "JcN1lMFl6Y7mOH1YOwveWQ", "221x8_nOCxf00GFzyFznmw", "S4cMempAALRILD7HLu2m8g", "15wWIdO4rnrcoqXCL_ZG0w", "7rU8cEbQExlLiEcwWFoAUg", "UVjlzUMDYPoyC30Px829Hw", "CkZI19vYJVmxsAk-AppowA", "yfYuRrvCzKWbEbRCuiZhKQ", "RDkI7QdCDd9LnNeq7hW75g", "2FMvL1Y3MZ-KpSqBe0lUfw", "UeWVKusLa3oEDgcL9Y07Vg", "TIQuKbmJscxaRAPVK0VSAQ", "qOa41n_31BNkU7IlTb96fg", "oGgRwQo811fTf8eI1Wroiw", "UWJk74yrUhXOf7mBAm048g", "TBnYGQe_r00gAG_Y43Pecw", "HTfwSqbC8uRxfCP_CDq0ug", "aKEG55QUj2jBn6V2V0fG5A", "OUknaxqHuuXSU78hsGhIpw", "BoGR-M9vtU-NpWkhcXydwQ", "7Q050blMdaN8KvcCnX5-xw", "FS7AwLCIzfiEjAXh1eyE3g", "qP0Ras-8ANBbSvNzhc7qXA", "jkJifgUuE30XTMRxuGm8uQ", "ErV-2Y_toxN41br7UMBqnQ", "4e0UbmAgO-0Fxgcz6KzUrg", "kwVwogGqDpWebOMUPniJ0A", "o4m7bUoM9DUFT59uGDnMdg", "GfJq6QtqAAICVWW2XUKNZg", "bydKRJeVu4aq_qIISvcOCg", "zQ3Mfvc_hm36ODohr8W-2Q", "vFbtb0icO_OoWwQ0T-YE2g", "1V0qKqOeQ0tlkjymLjWkFA", "qpHcaQpmRVbngq1-7n_ViA", "uXXsNx7y15CG1YfXDDt0gw", "FTQh_jV0-VwOXGbAfd04Ow", "0KKeifz7iqsieg1K7FwFdQ", "xGIEx6V9IIu93B_nPpsM1A", "So1Z5y_TC--dSah7sDZDRg", "efWNglgdlO5zCNzadneGNA", "GFEeyfW1Xhz4ruw5PZCdYw", "P765i09nMDhVMS-tso7OIQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "iOMQliLocGzVTICMTPlmhQ", "0r86mV_Xgp_tT2Vq_Othmg", "e5N1IObk3MiBt0w2izg4Hg", "-kr_HD5Urr5ZXkF3ngkr-g", "0JWyqXOAZrR5Q_x91PXOfg", "7-bcA5yI3imb1Es8jkkoIQ", "UNJYAOenCM1ZVpxLsp4OKA", "088ltpB1EmH44c6eZh4jfQ", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "wS6fmf8L0SRCuqNJ1e4ArA", "zJet6_5dufC8TOiLgRxjrQ", "_25iw87HEdzwCbKRd8A-yg", "TQ5ko2-JOPpiJHLm4S1DHw", "JgwxAl6gcNTqPllF6DQ31g", "rjcCrTLqGHzWGWxPIn8GPQ", "iPKLKDKv466jekpdWLhAAQ", "afo1zRp4Yj2Euk2WiQqK2A", "VlvND4U6bLPJALVuawpPOw", "2QIae7bItX95DccGfDENNg", "eDIt1NPMZfEeh6OqIPeI5w", "2fp7vzpYqfAUapOdC4Wf5Q", "-_7BUhIh2QoXgQUSfDx5QA", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "NnS2QdNdBatlbL7b0nACOQ", "C5ZwAd7TlkbMQ93gk_zECg", "yNLF-V6MnDqZS0IoLKhhDQ", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "ZuRBTpKHifS0aXplqJLvGg", "iUeavUAJg74FWVTm4rjDmw", "QZjbE0dgqJUPa8hiP_KqEA", "pq-yPNeYzDmOjQ8QtCs6qQ", "PZkkmvynRQ4qgOYXyE8uDw", "2QrKOzcLFgMdHkcCn3rsCA", "PeMiNfukt2jLwWsy5QldQA", "gmnDCKElOqjyZPjNBUde9w", "TBgvReCIPgnGpZwT4l1eMQ", "4n2F5a9_L0kLPNxGwADiZw", "0zBCji-fVHuT2SdByFX22Q", "Z4DIscnwrUEkldAVL-A1-g", "7vdpbtRAzox_6HQvDUJ3nA", "z5-qmn4J9C8gxx3aIp2AEQ", "Oobm-32Tz73yyunymR9cLA", "s1icA3wRxZqjnObT9aQpEA", "7L92iWtXlyqrcLJMgBbs-w", "xZ89Gz6rTv09Lgz0tRUIkQ", "6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q", "sVjpwOd-JBJC89bg-_iY6w", "DaMZUgZgBps_g_7uyRykkg", "rFbVLDyHQu1obHQ1oQZx_A", "JZsHOVAw7zCXRsQ4QOIs4Q", "Vgk5Cnye-wjiSMGDBKoK9w", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "bwsFjXKJAdXPMzaj1ioAOw", "m1lOUWVqsxR61eGEENWIuA", "ro-eUe0_0ZdTYT1ltfVVog", "OjbLMrjuaqZBvp5lmq19QQ", "YgVDLoZXvoxBwfNEIJqnVQ", "fGK1hZWpLPAjcdOQCz8rAQ", "tkoYIW9OfIpzQGfSYqxLYg", "nmoLLLhHZFoiTPUUKzhKGw", "6KnkHKRIwG7hGJtybfcsgw", "NlcdeIguq27S7coGW6KTEw", "aLKlUiEoKNknjYWcuqpLPQ", "sqM3AGDyHsGcrj_ne74pDg", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "ystQlX6s6CE0XOg6PClXPw", "Rei3kDEZdBCtkdG0B_fFwQ", "CRTtDvQ6JBGbXFzGLVfW0Q", "-3BGQjt4zG3PFRVGoL2ylw", "HYTz3-TG-smbsnNcP-Oc1Q", "CMZDABnxD44sGlCPekFu3w", "eMmbb5Ijw8qYPZ9woGxxYQ", "Cq7DDOugoPXeRn2h1ED7dw", "dMRoFMtP0NGRefPA4krBDw", "Jym0yu-Ej35FC8z8GHkzPA", "iRqdn7wMD9kvqWkJ21lycA", "vYu7gncy1Lo44Dk98_hUuw"], "elite": ["2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.87, "fans": 6}}

In my case, the hiccup was that the dessert menu listed on the website won't actually be available until they start serving dinner in the coming weeks. I also didn't make it easy on anyone by putting in a pretty complex order (rugelach to go, tea, brown sugar ricotta toast and the salmon grain bowl--which wouldn't be available until after 11 AM and it was only 10:30ish--to eat in) and then making it even more complicated by asking for them to hold the toast so that I could have it after the grain bowl. Yet, they managed to handle all of that quirkiness with grace. My friend's food arrived--he got the grilled cheese on a Jerusalem bagel and seemed quite pleased with it--and Chef Solomonov, who was actually acting as runner (a smart move as the kitchen staff works out the kinks), asked if I wanted to have the toast now, and I decided to go for it, since I was pretty hungry and it was still a little while before 11.\n\nShortly thereafter, a thickish slice of toast arrived, cut diagonally down the middle, topped with ricotta and figs, with brown sugar and a strategically administered blueberry syrup. A home run. I (somewhat reluctantly) allowed my friend to have a small piece, and he fell in love with it, vowing to return just so he could have his own order.\n\nThe nice thing about the toast is that while it was sweet, it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and the portion size was just right, so when my grain bowl arrived, I was ready to go. The two of them make a great combination, in whatever order you choose to eat them. The dish was called \"mujadara,\" and it included slow-roasted salmon, labneh (dusted with sumac), cucumbers and rice with lentils. It's a beautifully composed dish, and the portion is sufficient without being overwhelming. It could be lunch on its own for light eaters, or with the toast is quite satisfying for those of us who eat a little more but still don't want to be stuffed to the brim.\n\nThe physical space is lovely--there is a communal table and counter seating in addition to a number of tables toward the back--and it's light and airy and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and generally quite efficient, though they're still sorting a few little things like when to clear plates and handling the traffic flow--all to be expected when you've just opened.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have friendly people serving delicious food in a lovely setting. Have a little patience, as you should with any new spot, as they fine-tune the operation, but already it's very, very good. Looking forward to my next visit to Philly, so I can try the Rugelach French Toast from the soon-to-arrive dessert menu. :-)", "date": "2019-08-05 19:50:41", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1,

But, I'll make an exception for Camille Cogswell. The talented Ms. Cogswell, whose superlative desserts have given us yet another reason to visit Zahav.\n\nThere's good reason to my discipline. The first few weeks of a bakery or restaurant are hardly ever reflective of what's it capable of. No such worries at K'Far. No apparent operational kinks. The service and execution is top notch! Mike Solomonov is personally present and bridging the kitchen with the client. You can see Camille walking around with the bemused smile of someone who's still not reconciled with her celebrity. The GM is cheerfully handing out menus to those waiting in line, warmly greeting those entering, and delivering the inventory reports of the latest item the cafe has run out of. I've ribbed her as \"the bearer of bad news\", and she mostly took it well... mostly.\n\nSpeaking of the items they run out of: in my experience, on weekdays, they're out of the pistachio bun by ~ 9 am, and the mini-babka by 9:15-9:30 am (cafe is open 8 am -2 pm currently, dinner service to follow later). These are the two most popular items, in order (though I prefer the texturally complex chocolate Babka with its accent of orange over the pistachio sticky bun - and expect my view to become the popular consensus in coming weeks). The next to run out will be two of the four Borekas (the flakier Feta usually goes first, and is my favorite). The Rugelach (my favorite of all their desserts!) are the next most popular item, but they'll be gone by 10 am. A couple behind me in line tried to guilt me that they'd come all the way from Nashville, hoping to warm my heart before I took the last available ones... (I left them 2). You can safely count on the availability of the Jerusalem bagels. I'd rank the egg and cheese highest, followed by the grilled cheese and then the Basturma.\n\nIf you're picking the optimal time to visit, I'd recommend 8:45 - 9:00 am on weekdays: popular items haven't yet run out, and the wait is minimal as the 8 am crowd (that's been waiting in line since 7:30 am) has already been served. Expect to wait in line 40 minutes on the weekend, initially.\n\nIf there's a weak link - and I'm stretching here to illuminate an area for improvement - it would be the coffee drinks section. My espresso drinks have been delayed, not been called out when ready, or have been served lukewarm on 3 of my 4 visits. The superbly spiced Yemenite Latte is excellent (and pairs off nicely with the grainy texture of the walnut cake), but it's not been served hot... twice.\n\nSo far, K'Far is mostly winning hearts.",

Mr. Solomonov is also hitting you with those donuts. Yes, I said donuts that everybody loves, that has an unbelievably flavorful rush hitting your taste buds. Always warm, always fresh from the oven amazing donuts, with that double fried chicken known as Federal Donuts. That is the perfect combination, a one, two punch to the taste buds if you ask me. So with that impressive resume (partial, there is more to him) we surely can expect K'Far to be nothing short of spectacular.  \n\nAlright my Yelp family I guess you would like a little more information than a \"Just go in there, he knows what he is doing\", so  let us dive into this review as I scream Mazel Tov! \n\nWhat to get if you are wondering? How about ALL OF IT! There is no wrong decision by the way, plus this will give you another reason why you should return. I know I plan on making frequent trips to K'Far. \n\n- Jerusalem Bagel ~ I went with the egg and cheese , and this was simply on point my friends. This bagel panini style has so much flavor to it with the herbs and spices all baked into it.This is a must, I could've devoured three more of these if it wasn't for my family wanting and waiting to experience what I was. Yes, there is no shame to my game.\n\n- Brown Sugar Kubaneh Toast ~ Words can not describe the amounts of pleasure I was experiencing with this. This had a ricotta spread over top, a blueberry type of compote drizzled all over it, with a fig sitting on top. Simply delightful. \n\nNow when you enter K'Far, if that heavenly aroma isn't making you go crazy, their enticing desserts display will. This is where you separate the fools from the diabetics. \n\n- Pistachio Sticky Bun ~ The Pistachio Sticky Bun is the ruler, the godfather to them all. I'll kneel down now and kiss the ring. Just prepare yourself for an euphoric bliss once you've bitten into this sticky decadent sensation. \n\nMr. Solomonov, you must have the blueprint to winning, because you did it again my friend. In all I will clearly be returning to experience more from K'Far and their delights. I highly recommend this amazing establishment, where everything is a must order.\n\nI am Nando, and I approve this message.", "date": "2020-09-07 13:07:12", "useful": 19, "funny": 10, "cool": 13,

We arrived and the hostess (who happened to be our manager) seemed to have a little trouble finding our reservation but then quickly sat us at a table.\n\nI told our waitress that I was \"gluten free\" (I have Celiac disease) and she seemed surprised and said she'd check and see what accommodations could be made. \n\nShe came back and mentioned that they'd sub a piece of focaccia for lettuce and \"maybe some GF crackers or something\" for bread elsewhere ... I straight-out asked her if the meal would actually be a coherent one and whether this GF accommodation was something they have done before. She said yes, and I agreed to go ahead with it.\n\nThis review is going to focus entirely on costume service and follow through of management.\n\nI did not sleep one minute that night because of clear gluten contamination. I called the restaurant to let them know about the situation - was transferred to a manager and was asked questions ranging from what I ate, to what kind of symptoms I experienced ... I told her that I was fortunately not someone whose Celiac's disease would hospitalize me within minutes and that I hoped this to be looked into. No apology whatsoever. I was then told that she'd be in touch with the Chef and Owner and follow-up. No such follow-up and no apology.\n\nHad the meal and service been stellar, and had the administration of this restaurant apologized for the contamination, I would have probably written this off as a one-off.

I went once during the day and had a chicken salad sandwich which was yummy, but we recently went for their secret supper club and I have to say it felt like a gimmick and the food was nothing special.  There's nothing exclusive about it.  They say they \"only\" serve 30 at a time and that it's like having your own private chef, but any restaurant that size can \"only\" serve 30 at at a time and it's a tasting menu, not a supper club. Stop pretending. The first course was a salad with extremely salty dressing.  There was a ravioli dish with extremely salty cheese.  There was a cheese board with crostini that was so rock hard I seriously thought I would chip a tooth so I just stopped eating it.  The dessert was essentially vanilla ice cream with a 1/4 teaspoon of diced apple.....like a lazy person's apple pie.  Even the couple next to us was complaining about the food and didn't finish their dishes. On top of all that, we were told that since it was cold in the restaurant we should keep our coats with us.  For their prices, they should make sure the restaurant is adequately heated when it's 30 degrees outside.  No one wants to dine in their winter coat.  I might come back during the day but we will never come back for this over-rated, gimmicky \"Supper Club.\" Also their website boasts that they use Anthropologie's dinnerware. Well, they must be using stuff from the clearance rack. These dishes were dull, beige and chipped.

I had already gone up the couple of stairs and put my \"stuff\" at a chair and there was almost nobody there; they clearly had not seen that, which is understandable but they are supposed to ask.

I said I was planning to sit and wanted a real cup and she picked up a cup, poured it in, and handed it to me--it was nowhere near the size of a single espresso and now wasn't even quite hot enough. I put one of their wooden stirrers in the cup and the coffee stain only came up about 3/8's of an inch (and let's remember, this is a small curved-sided espresso cup).

This isn't super quick either (because you have to wait for your food to be reheated) and it was hard for my party of 3 to find a place to sit. It's seat yourself  community seating but there aren't enough places to sit. \n\nEven more importantly, the way it all works is so wasteful! Everything is pre-made. You pick out food from the refrigerator or behind the counter and they then reheat your hot food, or toss the salad in the the dressing it comes with, or just plate the side you ordered.

The girls behind the counter didn't even bother to swat them away until I pointed out one was sitting on a danish type item. She waved it away but left the item that the bug was on sitting there. I said that should not be sold as I walked to get my sandwich. When I went by on my way out I noticed that the plate, with those items had been removed, but I'm not at all sure it didn't come back once I left. \nReason I  think not was that they didn't bother to cover up other items and the flies had not left the building.\n \nPro: They have bakery items under glass as well so you can get something sweet that has not been landed on. \n\nJust don't get any company that puts food out this way -esp things that are sticky - flies just get, well....stuck!\nSame issue with Corner Bakery in that regard, but at least they have a glass divider of sorts. None of it does any good - esp. when people are working over the items sitting in front of them (taking money, passing things, etc) things worse than spit and flies can fall onto the food.

I have to say of the all the times I have been so far, the experiences have been 50-50.  Half the time, the staff is friendly, half the time they act as if I am wasting their time.  Half of the food I've tried has been amazing, half of it was overpriced and not worth the money I spent on it. I have found that anything I purchased out of the counter, was not worth the $$.  From the cooler the puddings were amazing.  The tuna salad was so dry, the egg salad, hmmm. The turkey with apple slaw-yum! The grilled cheese sitting out on the counter?  So unappealing, and not even an offer to warm them up.  Even starbucks offers to warm up their meager food offerings... We had to ask...  No help, no assistance, they acted like we should just know \"how it's done, and where everything is\". Customer service does not seem to be their forte.  And does anyone crack a smile? \nOne thing that I have had on a regular basis so far and not been too disappointed, has been the coffee.  The barista is great. And so was the ham and cheese croissant, of which there are not enough!  I could not bring myself to try the quiche, which sits out for any and all friendly little insects to try. I keep going back, but now it's for the basic turkey and slaw, the coffee, the maple pudding and the veggie coconut rice pudding.  The rest is just un-amazing and overpriced.

The same goes for Talula's Daily. Maybe I missed something? \n\nWe came here for lunch. When we walked in no one paid any attention to us or steered us in the right direction. We moseyed up the stairs and asked to see the menu. The gentleman behind the counter told us there was no menu. Everything is out already and you just take what you want and pay. There were literally grilled cheeses out in the open stacked on top of one another. This is not what we were expecting at all. We thanked him and went somewhere else. \n\nIt seems like this is a great grab and go or grab and work sort of place. Lots of people in business attire and/or with laptops hooked up. If you are looking to enjoy a causal, sit down lunch on a day off this is probably not the spot for you. \n\nI understand now what they are going for and they may be great for that.

It is because every day there is something new you haven't tried or something you want that is missing.\n\nOne day there are cupcakes then the next, no cupcakes. After making the mistake of splitting their awesome red velvet cupcake with my bf, I journeyed back the next day to purchase another red velvet cupcake. Turns out there were no red velvet cupcakes or any other cupcakes for that matter. After asking one of the staff, I was told that what baked goods are made for the day are determined by the chef. There is no schedule. So if I wanted a few red velvet cupcakes, I would need to order some. Big sigh. Pretty much every two days, I would go looking for my red velvet, and left with something else instead. Here is a review of a few things that I am a fan of:\n\n1) Chocolate chip cookie: When served warm or a few hours out of the oven, it is one of the best ccc I have ever had. I have seen them wrapped in plastic recently on the side. However, after a slight squeeze of the plastic wrapped cookie, I know that they cannot compare to that fresh from the oven taste. These used to be $1.50 but now they are $2.00...\n\n2) Red velvet cake: Unfortunately Tartes Bakery loses the trophy for best red velvet in the city. However, at least I can count on Tartes if I am having a rvc craving.\n\n3) Quiche: They have all different kinds. I am not even sure if they make the same combinations of quiche daily. At $4.50, it is a breakfast steal. I split this with my bf and inside the quiche was packed with turkey bacon, turkey breast, arugula, and cheese. \n\n4) Bear claw: Delicious, but if I only have 3 dollars to spend for breakfast, it is not my first choice.\n\n5) Carrot Cake: Down home goodness. Used to be $2.50 now it's $3.00 argh...\n\n6) Pumpkin Bread: Snacked on this for a few hours. Great flavoring. A subtle punch of pumpkin flavor. Crisp on the edges and goes along well with their cappuccino.\n\n7) Scones: Apple and Ginger, Raspberry and Lemon, Mixed Berry...all great. Mixed berry is my personal favorite just because lemon in the morning with milk doesn't sit well with me. The scones  taste even better when you get one of the day old scones for $1.50 instead of the $3.00 that they usually go for. \n\n8) Mocha Cupcake: Usually I am not a frosting eater but it was so smooth and creamy, I didn't even notice that I was eating it. \n\nThings that I am over:\n\n1) That sandwich and salad bar! Listen, it tastes fresh but I just can't get with paying $8 and up for something that is pre-made.\n\n2) Where do I sit? Where do I stand? Where do I order? When it gets very crowded in here, I have no idea how this works. i just throw myself in a line or at a table and hope no one growls at me.", "date": "2013-09-16 03:56:54", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "e4z0a6hpIPOO1TtlO0UfsA", "name": "R.", "review_count": 27, "yelping_since": "2013-01-17 21:59:34", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.44, "fans": 0}}

The space is great, nice and large, with the coffee bar right at the front with most of the baked goods, and then the cheese/deli counters on a split-level that opens up to seating for patrons. They have a reasonable selection of prepared foods, and more that you can order freshly prepared, and everything seems to be really reasonably priced. They had a sampling of a salmon mousse dip with crackers, which was delicious (didn't pick up, but coming back to buy soon!).\n\nI ended up getting a number of treats to try out with my sweetie over the weekend, in addition to some very, very necessary iced coffee for $3 that was tasty and refreshing :\n\nVanilla Bean Panacotta: Creamy, silky smooth panacotta had a light vanilla flavor, and the balsamic strawberries on top were sweet and fresh, and together the flavors were delicious\nSalted Caramel Bar: Delicious! A scrumptious, salty-sweet, perfect caramel flavor, but it was very oozy because of the humidity that day. The crust was a thin, buttery, and delicious butter cookie. A very sweet and rather rich treat\nMud Cookie: This cookie was quite large for its intense flavor. The dark chocolate batter was filled with large semi-sweet chocolate disks and toasted walnut pieces. It was moist, chewy, dense, and ideal for chocoholics\nTiramisu: It came layered in a To Go plastic cup, and was a delicious example of the classic tiramisu flavors, with mini chocolate covered crisp balls on top for an added crunch\nChocolate Nut Truffles: The crunchy chocolate outer layer enclosed a creamy dark chocolate ganache filling, and was rolled in crushed nuts. Yum!\nChocolate Chip Cookie: A classic example with crisp edges, a chewy center, and large semi-sweet chocolate disks. My fiance is a cookie fiend, and he said this was one of the best he's had.\nBlueberry Cornmeal Bar: This bar was very thin, but made up for its size in quality. It was moist with the lovely, naturally sweet flavors of fresh blueberries\nCarrot Cake Square: This was really delicious, and a classic, moist, lightly spiced carrot cake with finely ground nuts and a thin layer of cream cheese frosting on top. The tart sweet flavor of the frosting was great, and the perfect ratio to cake, a real crowd pleasing carrot cake\nUltimate Brownie: Large, fudgy semi-sweet chocolate brownie that lived up to its name. It was moist and a bit dense, with (I think) macadamia nuts, chocolate chunks, and a white chocolate drizzle on top. I can't remember if there was another nut, but it was very yummy, satisfying, and filling", "date": "2013-08-23 16:12:47", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id":

I ended up dragging two of my friends along during a recent trip back to Philly. Being a small-ish shop with only about 20 seats, we unfortunately didn't manage to get dinner reservations for their secret supper club, so we went for Sunday lunch instead. \n\nTalula's Daily is divided into two sections: the bakery & breakfast side, which you see when you first walk in, and the cafe & market side. I'll admit that I felt a twinge of disappointment when I first wandered into the cafe side and only saw a fridge filled with prepackaged sandwiches and salads, like the kind they have in Au Bon Pain. But then I turned around and saw a display case full of non-packaged food, which instantly redeemed my hopes! As it turns out, the food in the display case is priced per pound, and you can get it either in containers to go or heated up to eat at a table. I decided to try the mushroom risotto, which cost about $6 for a scoop and a half(ish). A bit expensive, and it could've been a little creamier, but it was still pretty delicious. Friend #1 got the sweet potato and apple soup, which was fairly thick and tasted more like applesauce than sweet potato. Friend #2 got the chicken with maple and mustard glaze, which was also pretty good - sweet, and surprisingly tender.\n\nMeanwhile on the bakery/breakfast side, you can get different types of pastries, brownies, cookies, scones, etc as well as frittatas and breakfast sandwiches. I was still hungry so I ended up ordering the broccoli, onion, and cheddar frittata. For the same price as my risotto, it was so big I couldn't even finish it. I also got a free mudslide cookie (thank you, Yelp check-in deal!), which was incredibly chocolately and rich, almost like a brownie. Other cookie flavors they had that day were chocolate chip, sugar, and peanut butter.\n\nConclusion: I still like Talula's Garden (right next door) more for the sit-down aspect and the ambiance, but Talula's Daily is a quaint, homey option for a quick breakfast or lunch.

The earliest reservation I could get was for 8:30 but that was no problem at all - it was pouring rain outside and we arrived a bit earlier than expected since we decided to Uber over and were immediately greeted at the door, checked our heavy coats, and offered something to drink while we waited for our table.\n\nTalula's Daily is a super cute caf\u00e9 during the day that I've been to a couple of times for a macha latte which is always a very relaxing space to write or read. On New Year's Eve, it had been transformed into a formal dining area with gold and blue ballons and decorations.\n\nWe were seated at a corner table which I always prefer so I can sit a little closer to my boyfriend and not be at opposite ends of a table. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the 5 course menu and options. Usually the Supper Club 5 course meal is $55 pp, but for New Year's Eve, it was $75 pp which was understandable.\n\nMy boyfriend and I each got something different for each course so we could try the whole menu. We started with the butternut squash soup and arugula salad - both were great! The soup was tasty and warmed me right up while the salad had a delicious dressing and toppings. We then moved on to the pasta dish in a light cream sauce with huge shavings of white truffles on top - a very nice touch. The main course consisted of a scallops with sunchokes dish and my boyfriend had steak in a bordelaise sauce which he said was spectacular. The scallops were good but didn't wow me.\n\nWe ended our meal with a lovely cheese board paired with three mini desserts. We wished there were more crackers for the three kinds of cheeses since we were only given a couple each. The mini deserts were our favorite - a gingerbread cream puff, an espresso cupcake, and rose macaroon! How fun are those?! \n\nAll in all, we did have a really nice dinner and this was a great way to celebrate New Year's Eve. I get the price increase for a holiday but I'd say this meal was definitely worth $55 pp, although the $75 pp seemed a bit steep for what we got... we'll be back for the regular supper club though!",

GIANT HEARTS(insert emoji).\n\nThis review is based on two encounters once for a lady date with wine and cheese and the other for the secret supper club. \n\nI met one of my favorite lady pals here a few months  back and we did what we always do... share a cheese board and gossip over glasses of wine. The cheese board was the perfect size  and came along with a few house made accompniments including a TDF quince like paste. The monger asked us our cheese preferences and we both agreed we could do without any blues. The board that came out was pure magic and he even threw in a few slices of a house cured chrozio like sausage. It was a decent size board for two to share and they have boards to fit any size group priced up to 35-40.00. My only  gripe about my afternoon here is the very small and pricey wine list. A few blocks west and a few blocks south one could visit a well known wine bar with alot more options and a better price range for wine. i will pay for delocious grapes in a glass but my sav blanc here rang in at 11.00 and to me its tasted more like an 8.50 glass if that. The seating situation is intense and forces you to be a friendly philadelphian ( even if deep down you hate everyone) Get there at the open of the doors or stroll in after 1:30 or you will be fighting that old couple thats seated at a 4 top instead of  two top for a seat.  My afternoon delight here left me with a four star impression.\n\nI'm always a fan of group dinners and tend to stick with a crew who's down to spend a few shekels more for a great meal. From start to finish the supper club was beyond five start right away. We had a few dietary restrictions at the table , but our server Erin quickly diffused any bombs and the delicious food followed shortly after. 5 courses of well prepared food came out over the course of 3 hours. First the bean dip split between table sections with amazing crackers and warm bread. The salted flour pot bread that came out shortly after made me want to cry it was so good. Our next course was a smoked trout salad again fresh and light prepared and presented so well . The chicken and dumplings ( or extra dumplings for me ) was hearty and filling and the dumplings were so good . Our fourth course was a mountain cheese board and featured La Tur which is pretty much the most amazing cheese that will ever hit your lips. All the accompaniments were prepared in house and the local honey was a nice added touch. Dessert left us all speechless . A mini smorgasbord of decadence. Chocolate chip cookie sandwiches filled with ice cream and rolled in bacon = #sydi and love every bite . Our board also featured a orange scented Madeline , flour less molten chocolate cake and a pine nut square that made me drool.\nService from Erin was spot on. Our group got a little rowdy once the restaurant started clearing out and most peoples beverage pairings were down to drink 4 and 5 .\nI will most definitely be back. Did I mention the house made granola parting gift that made the perfect morning snack the day.\n\nPro tip- so Sunday supper with up to 12 of your foodie friends . Email or mark your reso with any dietary restrictions.\n\nDo the optional beverage pairing it's so worth it . Or split a bottle of wine.", "date": "2014-02-09 13:46:35", "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "P9hbcVoZIPKF4gV8KH427A", "name": "Aaliyah", "review_count": 590, "yelping_since":

Unfortunatlely, to our unpleasant surprise, it was not open until 4pm.  Next time we are in Philadelphia, we do fully intend on returning to Talula's Garden during their operating hours because the place was so aesthetically pleasing and I've read a plethora of wonderful reviews.... so, we can't wait! \n\nSo.... (Back to Talula's Daily)....We came to a consensus that our hunger could not wait until 4pm, and my boyfriend and I needed to catch a flight later that afternoon, so we decided to walk to Talula's Daily.  At a first glance from the front entrance, it 'seemed as though' our only options would likely be hot tea and coffee with pastries and possibly a pre-made deli sandwich.\n\nBoy... were we wrong!!  Once we entered this adorable little cafe... we soon realized that it offered much more than just coffee, tea, and pastries.  The options in the deli case were so enticing and mouthwatering that it was hard to narrow it down to just a few items to share! We ordered the kale and watermelon salad (which i fell in love w/ so much - I now make this salad at home with my own little revision), a mushroom quiche, grilled salmon, a sauteed vegetable medley, and the carrot cake.\n\nWe chose a cute round table in the back, grabbed our silverware, sharing plates, and some cups of water from the self-serve area under the window sill, and waited for them to heat our food while we oo-ed and ahh-ed over how cute and trendy the decor was... with so many vibrant colors, unique trinkets, kitchen and cooking essentials for sale with a mini market (selling fancy pastas, jams, crackers, etc).... My boyfriend and I were recently in Paris, and the decor and feel of this spot reminded us so much of our favorite little hidden treasure in Paris~!!\n\nAfter the chef adorned our table with the dishes we ordered, which were served in all different colored and shaped serving bowls, it was displayed so beautifully, that we could not wait to dig in!  We indulged in a little tasting feast of each dish and barely even spoke to each other during the experience, because we were enjoying the food so much... haha... each item we ordered tasted fresh, gourmet, well-balanced, and light.  Not what you would \"normally expect\" from food at a \"caf\u00e9 style\" fast dining luncheon, nothing tasted greasy or like it's been on the shelf a day too long... and we were pleasantly surprised and satisfied to perfection.  The carrot cake was a great way to finish off our meal... not too sweet, just enough icing, & perfectly cakey ... viola!\n\nPlease do yourself a favor, and stop by this cute little spot conveniently located at Washington Square.... it is sure to satisfy your appetite, and please your palate!\n\nCheers!!", "date": "2013-09-27 16:25:11", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id":

True enough, it was one of my best meals in Philly so far. \n\nThe vibe is very casual and home-y. It was very rustic with the whole candle-light vibe going. I found it romantic and intimate, while at the same time without being overbearing. I thought this would be a great place to go on a date. \n\nFoodwise, we had: \n\nWARM GARLIC BREAD: I think bread says a lot about the restaurant because it's often your first bite or taste of what the restaurant has to offer. In this case, they executed something as basic as garlic bread extremely well. The bread was extremely flavorful and my friend and I could not get enough. \n\nCRAB HUSH PUPPIES: This continued the strong streak of the night. The crab hush puppies were absolutely fantastic. It was extremely tasty and well executed. Though the portion size was quite small, it was still great. \n\nSPRING VEGETABLE CRUDITES: Talula's did this in two ways. First, they sent out a selection of vegetables on a stone plate that were roasted/steamed then drizzled with vinaigrette. Afterwards, they sent out a salad using the same ingredients and the same vinaigrette. Have to say, I wasn't that big of a fan of these dishes. I had a hard time finishing these. It tasted quite plain and was not that remarkable. \n\nROASTED ROCKFISH: This dish was perfectly-executed with the skin of the fish being crispy and the meat of the fish being soft without being over-cooked. That being said though the dish wasn't particularly remarkable. It was served with farfalle, butter, and beans. Everything was extremely fresh but I don't really have anything to say beyond that. \n\nBAKED GOAT CHEESE: This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The baked goat cheese was probably the best I've ever tasted. The cheese was flavorful without being overbearing and because it was baked, it was smoother and creamier than usual. This was covered in a pastry that was extremely flakey and flavorful as well. The strawberry-rhubarb conserve was a perfect complement to the dish. \n\nFOIE GRAS GELATO: Though the foie gras did not stand out that much to me, this dish was still a great way to end the meal. The candied fennel and butterscotch sauce, which I was a bit skeptical about at first, actually made for a great combination. It was great to see how all of these seemingly unrelated flavors complemented each other well. This was definitely worth savoring. \n\nThough their menu changes every month, I think Talula's Secret Supper Club is a must-try!", "date": "2015-06-01 03:38:35", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1,

I've been three times for the \"secret\" supper menu in various years and various seasons, and the experience has always been phenomenal.  I visited most recently on Saturday night with my fiance, and the evening did not disappoint our very high expectations.\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation, and the host kindly offered to let us sit in the cafe and order a glass of wine while we waited for our table.  Throughout the time we sat there, we noticed that he was equally cordial to others who showed up and had to wait for their reservation spots.  Once the small cafe was filled, he began directing couples to wait at the bar next door at the Garden instead.  We took the host's recommendation for a sparkling wine and were so comfortable we did not even check to see how long we were waiting.\n\nOur server at the table was just as welcoming and polite as the host.  He mostly left us to enjoy our dinner without many interruptions, which is what we prefer, but every so often asked how we were doing so that we never felt neglected.  The November menu was excellent!  The broccoli cheddar soup was more broccoli than cheddar, the braised short rib melted in our mouths, and I could be happy eating the butternut squash risotto every day.  The cheese and flourless chocolate cake provided just the right finishing touches, and we were relieved that those portions were relatively small given how heavy the rest of the meal was.  \n\nWe opted for the wine pairing and are glad we did.  I felt I was drinking a bit too slowly at times -- it seemed they always had another wine ready to go for us! -- but the wines complemented the food well and probably amounted to 2+ glasses each in total (for $35pp).  The wines included a sparkling, white, red, and sweet for dessert.\n\nThe ambience is understated yet classy, which I always like.  Every time I have gone, there's been a mix of couples, smaller groups, and larger groups at big tables.  It feels simultaneously cozy and special.

This time, with the mask mandate freshly reinstated, I came in without a mask, as there were no signs about mask required. I had a mask in my backpack, and my hands were very full as I approached the counter. I was told that I had to wear a mask to order. I let them know I do have a mask in my bag, and once I settled myself I would gladly put it on, not knowing the rules had changed. I was told no, they would not take my order. They watched my fumble with my bag with my hands full with a water bottle and wallet, dropping things trying to find the mask until they finally offered masks across the room. I asked if I could order and then go get the mask, not wanting to lose my place in line. I was told no again. The employees behind the counter could clearly see I was flustered and had no patience, or empathy/compassion/ just understanding that I was having just not a great time and was not trying to break any rules. Resigned, I went to go grab the mask, and took an extra. I was truly berated when I approached the counter again for taking an extra mask. At that point, I just wanted to sit down and study, which is what I came to do in the first place. As I settled myself, I realized that truly NO ONE in the establishment was wearing a mask while sitting down, while some people it was understandable as they were eating and drinking. But others who were on their laptops, reading books etc, there was no enforcement of the mask mandate upon them. I was infuriated that the rules seemingly only applied to me in that moment, that I had to be humiliated at the counter only to see that nobody else was being told to adhere to the rules. Truly a disappointing experience and I will be telling my circle not to come here unless they feel as though they want to be targeted. \n\n\n\nI ordered a iced coffee with caramel and oat milk, and it may have been the worst drink I've had the handful times I've been here.

Went in Saturday morning for breakfast and ordered a chicken sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and they got my order wrong twice, and a lot of the staff were pretty rude / didn't handle the situation well.\n\nWe got our food twenty-thirty minutes after ordering and after taking two bites of my bagel I realized that there's beef sausage instead of chicken sausage inside. I went up to the counter to let them know their mistake and the woman who I spoke to just sort of said oh and asked for my order again. No apology. I told them I wanted it to go this time since my friend had to head out really soon. After 10-15 min. when I checked back the guy I spoke to said that it was in the queue so they would get to it soon, and it would maybe be another 5-7 minutes. \n\nGiven that they messed up my order and that I was sitting with nothing in front of me as my friends ate, I feel the least they could have done was to make sure it was at the front of the line. Anyway, it came out a bit later and the guy who handed it to me apologized and gave me a card for a free coffee. \n\nI got home and took a few bites and then saw that 1. This time there was no cheese (which I ordered and paid extra for) 2. The eggs were not over easy (the yolk was solid) and 3. There were just two dinky pieces of chicken sausage one either side of the egg yolk. Two sausages each the size of your finger, and not very good either. \n\nI went back to ask for a refund because the whole thing was ridiculous. The manager apologized and refunded me, but the experience was just very frustrating.", "date": "2016-02-20 18:33:46", "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "CcqpZkc5ngs88akzQ0rFHg",

For such a nice neighborhood cafe, the service and quality of drinks we received was horrendous. We came here to order an iced oat milk latte and a smoothie. The smoothie was fine, but our iced oat milk latte came out with oat milk that had GONE BAD. I repeat, the OAT MILK WAS ROTTEN.\u00a0\n\nYou would think that the lack of mixing between the oat milk and coffee would be a sign that the milk had gone bad, but we were served the drink with a creamier oat milk and were confused. After just one sip, we realized that the sour flavor was ROTTEN MILK. Immediately, we brought this up to the people working behind the counter, WHO DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. Indignantly, the woman behind the bar took the drink to the man who made it, and he seemed ANNOYED that the drink was sent back. We did not receive any apology, and instead of remaking our drink immediately, they made MULTIPLE other drinks first so that we had to wait for our drink to be remade. We were not offered anything in return for being served ROTTEN MILK.\u00a0\n\nAt the end, I didn't even see them throw the milk out. It makes me wonder - who else is being served rotten milk? What other ingredients are sub-par that this place uses for their food? I will NOT be returning, and I hope that some health agency looks into the lack of oversight on the health of their ingredients. I highly recommend you go to the Starbucks in Callowhill if you want friendly service and healthy ingredients.", "date": "2021-08-13 20:35:36", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id":

The ambiance is inviting, the food is lacking. I've been vegan for 8 years and frequent many spots with vegan/vegetarian menus. The dirty chai was good; they offer different options of soy, oak and nut milk which is a plus. The vegan food was of the worst I've had in Philadelphia. The tempeh bacon was extremely dry and lacked flavor. It was not seasoned at all. The veggie scramble was also extremely dry and lacked flavor. The potatoes were undercooked and under seasoned. I tried to add a bit of salt and pepper as i realize each customer is different and likes different things. This did not help. I think vegan menus only work if the owner understands that vegan food should be seasoned the same way meat should.

Absolutely awesome. Best thing about this place. Aside from the amazing selection of leaf teas. \nSadly the rest of the service is really lacking. And the kitchen is all over the place. They served up a wrap that was cooked on one side and literally freezing cold on the other. There was a huge discussion and a lot of passive aggressive behavior over putting it right, instead of just smiling and saying \"I'm sorry, we'll fix this\". Or just decide - is it a hot dish or a cold dish?\nThen they dropped half the wrap on the dirty counter and had a conversation about whether they should put it back on my plate, before deciding it was fine to replate it off the dirty counter. Right in front of me!!! The people on the next table had their order screwed up too. Plain bagel with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Seriously? After waiting for half an hour?\nAlso, the bathrooms are in a disgusting state - a cess pit of germs.\nWhen OCF gets its food right it's great. But they really really need to get their act together in the kitchen and change the attitude of some of their staff. And do something about their basic hygiene standards.

Much of it sounds good and it's not terrible, but it's a little annoying to be nickled and dimed (really quartered and dollared) for an egg sandwich to include bacon and cheese (or whatever you prefer).  \n\nThe ambiance appears to be one inviting you to sit and stay a while, but its so horribly uncomfortable and crowded that it is near impossible.  The cleanliness is also average at best, with sticky tables and floors although the kitchen appears reasonably clean.  \n\nService is mediocre to good.  I will add, they use ipads with what are effectively automatic tipping requirements.  Good for the worker, but I'm not apt to add 15% on what amounts to pouring and handing me a cup of coffee.

The baristas are very kind, friendly, chill and are always happy.\n\nAtmosphere: Big, wide, open with lots of light and windows onlooking the street. There are plenty of tables that are easy to seat 1 or 2 to a larger group. They have huge windows facing the street that open up during summer and look onto Eastern State Penn. It has an earthy, modern, 'studio' feel. They don't have many outlets in general so if you have a computer and want to plug it in, it could be difficult. \n\nFood: Meh, this is probably the biggest reason why I give this place 3 instead of 4 stars. I've ordered some things that sounded really really yummy and have been pretty disappointed. The fig & brie sandwich? Sounds YUM! But it's not :( I think I could make something better. I have not had anything off the brunch menu, sooo that could be much better than the other things I've had. I'll be back again and make an effort to have something from the brunch menu.\n\nCoffee: Great! I've never had a bad drink here. They have lots of options for tea and coffee. Try the Nutella latte if you need something sweet and something with coffee. I love coffee, but for people who don't- it's a great intro drinking coffee. \n\nPrices: Because I don't dig the food I've had, I'd say it's overpriced. BUT the coffee is reasonably priced. \n\nParking: there is street parking for free for about 2-3 hours without a permit. There is also parking with meters down the street a little.", "date": "2014-12-11 17:40:32", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "p5sRfw_mDHha3JXf7akIOA", "name": "Jezelle",

I was comparing it to an Arnold palmer, but with coffee instead of lemonade.  It was very pleasant and I'd probably order it again just to see if I can recognize more flavors.\n\nThe chocolate covered bacon, IMO, was less successful.  It was... well.. bacon.. covered in chocolate.. which in all is what was displayed, is what was sold, is what is expected, yet, I wanted something more.  The chocolate on its own was delicious, a dark variety and the bacon was pleasant with a touch of smoke and salt.  You'd think these would be more successful, but it just didn't do it for us.  Either the bacon needed some more sprinkling of something or the chocolate needed to be thinned out a bit (it was quite thick).", "date": "2015-03-23 18:00:40", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "2-IA-jVpiZIxC0gi8QQUpQ", "name": "Dan", "review_count": 117, "yelping_since": "2012-12-31 13:53:20", "friends": ["x6erNzhuM_c7xW6PlqClIQ", "90LRTAl9knIOAN_HwHqcBQ", "_hPjqzQDiyw1-4U_IAETpg", "6hSNTPQ3Dn4q1cSXKnqyCA", "Ky3SbNgQf8dmKM3DumRTYw", "-E5ludIj5mWg9bXlH9jJSQ", "37cpUoM8hlkSQfReIEBd-Q", "135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A", "6vXkAfEqUHgNGilY_Nxm_A", "QGM4ZOfmwxMj4hpe8cTSUw", "HxyLRaoH9PS09M6R3rV-EQ", "hQjN1FuYaB4pQACZwfrclw", "HjyeYbnxg20fzRK7jyqPHg", "X-8WUdJ1hYidYXQygzTEBw", "E-A3ei62Y1vXj9_UPVvarQ", "61FNJUiDqXReViksOYiILQ", "5i5OMr5TWrhFqVI4W_xhKg", "MW965c2DykiU3ehen8bdKA", "80bhTVC9Ks1KlkmhrowJhQ", "UiRx8jyS6H957ItwFsP2nQ", "F1V-YF-nHy1miIofqpwphA", "B9iPTih0dmpZn6fRyZnLLg", "z9sL9d4kfAiQeGJ1dGmBng", "A1nIXS5XEWeZ2EUUcOsurA", "r0EMarP03IzTX1zLBH3Aiw", "rZg5xWm--gdr6LiHoqe_AA", "VClMTiHXXYlLNjalD3N4XQ", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "P4G5AT0eSTXUC1vUxiKOlA", "BTHXLOCKyo1z8ZrWq8-9_g", "sO73BTsT-HKSCEFA2fxX0A", "w1O5Ifjaf0y7RDJjFWEDlQ", "89aoy6WORObOOdU5yPQxoQ", "bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA", "TR7ezcRznfr1Jif7euZZJg", "UJEjJgi1xpmLR4b3J8fn2Q", "oBOTde_uEobbnUcgU9wfDg", "8eoJqXX2qkj4I7cRZhXE6w", "kUifZFxMQzNl4rW52F3m3Q", "Kc7IwXLrJVqAVMkX6pxWbA", "8MrHNUT0QBpD5vHxn1rD2w", "jQyLHq_YNCdD578JMQB4AA", "1N4HNCbMIead4r_22jseHw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "qav-dqbcMysEkxABRcI18w", "N8ITUUDRBpo1hTNDvk1byA", "7XXKi6pgXeX1uJZcGjKNRQ", "XJBwTudV0ds9r1MNhQj3Xg", "N9hqTPQu2bmI8c2Pj8F1ww", "FlXBpK_YZxLo27jcMdII1w", "oM_H0lSJDGM63K7kPx95dg", "8aoRZKdr4q6VC5J2lDsvqQ", "0mYni30yNjmPQKn92maGyg", "5GLB61xLOP6T-pNsr7rslg", "Aau_Dv6rUx1CIMDI6iPxNg", "z6yiUezvRETRFFTQeBfThw", "mvpJlHfhn1yQsrS2TH-yKQ", "3oPsQOuuwtl3ITdiT3L2ig", "t-cWCcy1T6gv_JuL8Lsksw", "MvpLTu64iSKNgwrcS5_r3Q", "sE1T1wT2alHRdy5iRezN0Q", "Xejp85N5_YwaC7eOwO3MmQ", "ZOAJ6tt9hRhJNl-ICdgjBA", "yIsQ4qFCyY-clmlRwQlw_w", "_W7GXF-Kf_prAOCSz08Caw", "t0H40VMYAPY1GPrzc_C10w", "iN0A6QIrEFYoSGHFaknh8Q", "yiASjfFlDJdNk9bjkZb2Cg", "GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w", "FqKDxc3zWyREuRLXTpC1iQ", "JnUObp6gj3HUvaI6ubTzWQ", "ixtKgePFibGVpyMrPogstg", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "scMLUgV1SzTe9TjBBuf3tg", "1yrLU60_9QYzpmTP8OG0wA", "_pLiYUnQ10T9S25A-30f3A", "sl-BlaQGCpPS-08jsSqDgg", "NFeNXGbZWRCe6qMEppNdRw", "QCNLvK6xxebYoItPU49-Og", "ryisT19-tzvMyVVi0iLvwA", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "W1eHcjd6kwKAzeFwDoOuJg", "GcdYgbaF75vj7RO6EZhPOQ", "-y4O_E79Z6QwEI1p4OU_0w", "hj5Ja8M2vSTLgmcgzOW0Gg", "Um_v7uJeGlvfqff5l8tjLA", "_tDsHb122SE9PUaTXzgrag", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "LBnub5RKV-vaadj2pa_zHQ", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "KO_w7opb4VthO-69-qU6JA", "QRUCiW1LwtHiRDjorK3UHA", "YzXQQX0Fb3YfFEQ22tQh8g", "iEONL-v4W46yliYsovCP_g", "f_1bRw8RuK-zZAKuUMTqNw", "-fOI-8ELzpAMvmyjk-mUSw", "1JfHD63MIZbOjrYQ74vzvQ", "grTjP2l2FnAzj8CdbT3M6A", "GRaDwcClp6bONpWBoU8Qbg", "2QNB9bvIkq71FvrJoqGgeA", "IxoM8mRDv0T9J1SI5fFlQQ", "DlFbNJyOovNZm319yKJqSA", "EJ8pe71KG0UXb2SbI9ACKw", "PZFrRD8EHsd3WLzDOYv64A", "4lXwcTkAaoZoO17y9eOljQ", "eMch5xR2VzZtxGBMpq_VRA"], "elite": ["2015", "2016", "2017"], "average_stars": 3.9, "fans": 14}}

Even with my head phones in and white noise playing I still heard the music. I don't mind music in the background but when it completely over powers everything else its annoying. \n2) The table height is not set for the chairs it is matched with, makes it incredibly hard to type/write do anything when sitting in the chair normally without having to compromise your posture or comfort. Granted, I am on the shorter side so maybe its just not for me...\n3) The lights are so weird that when it started getting dark I could barely see...I sat all the way on the right side of the place against the wall so I can only speak for the lights here but it seemed like they were more whiteish light than the natural yellow light which is better for studying/looking at a computer. Honestly, I don't know the technicalities of light fixtures but what I do know is that my eyes were straining...\n\n\nAs a coffee/food place this is a great spot! I loved the coffee and foods.

Also it is reasonably priced for most items on the menu and they have many options available.  I would've given it 5 stars except for one thing...\n\nWHAT IS WITH THOSE CHAIRS?!?!? These chairs drive me nuts.  This looks like a similar chair( http://goo.gl/CM0Nc2 ).  Here is a breakdown. The chair itself is made out of a sturdy, hard, aluminum-like metal.  I don't have a problem with this as chairs are meant to be sat on so they need to be sturdy.  On the other hand, chairs are not supposed to inflict pain on the user, unless used in some sort of late 90's wrestling match.   The seat is broken into 3 slats of metal, I assume to save in cost when using one continuous piece.  You don't notice this as a problem at first, but after about a half an hour of your cheek bleeding through the gaps, it wears on you.  This same slat approach is used for the backing of the chair.  While I don't have the same critique of the back due to the weight of my body not being forced through the gaps, the angle of the chair is not conducive prolonged leaning back in a chair while working with a laptop on a table.  Let talk about how this chair works with the tables at the coffee shop.  Each table is suited for one person to squeeze into the.  I use the word squeeze because the width of the legs of the chair are only slightly smaller than the width of the tables.  Pulling a chair into the table is near impossible and requires some ninja like scooting & shimmying skills.  Including yourself, if your party is greater or equal to 1, I highly suggest lining up your chair precisely in a manner that allows you to scoot with minimal effort.  This is easier said than done.  Don't even think about combining tables after sitting.  Better to just sit a separate tables and shout.  So assuming you are there to get some private work done, and your all set up in your chair and have passed the puzzle of pulling your chair into the table the next thing you must deal with is the table height.  For some reason the difference between the height of the table and the seat of the chair was extraordinarily big.  I can only assume OCF only wanted people with tall torsos to drink coffee at their coffee shop.  For the rest of us normal-torso-lengthed individuals, working from these chair-desk combos is extremely painful after a little while.  You must hunch your shoulders if you plan to type on your keyboard or use the mouse because of the disproportionate table to chair height.  Imagine a mummy or zombie like creature walking toward you with their arms out and hunched shoulders....brains!!!  Now look over at someone in the OCF coffee shop working on their computer.  Now remove the table and laptop while the person holds still.  Although this chair dilemma haunts me, I do frequent this place a lot.  I struggle with this problem often and think I deserve a free coffee or scone or something.... that is all.", "date": "2014-03-24 22:03:50", "useful": 4, "funny": 3, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "feW6c3thDiwEPX6ntLILBg", "name": "Ryan", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2014-03-24 22:03:26", "friends": ["1HNx7ZWtYCBzgqT3tSeB_w"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 0}}

We weren't sure just what to expect when we met for a brunch date here in our old 'hood, Fairmount.  \n\nWe used to live in area and would frequent the business (Mugshots) that was formerly at this location. While I do feel the space has lost its cozy 'Friends' type coffee shop vibes complete with cozy couches, a newer, brighter, bigger, hip and industrial chic place has taken over. They unexpectedly offer delicious food and beverages with acknowledgment to vegan and gluten free patrons. \n\nThe new space is literally double what Mugshots was, but now heavy on the wood with exposed beams and huge windows allowing for great views of The Eastern State Penitentiary to be seen while you dine or get some studying or work done which it seems most people that weekday morning were doing. \n\nThere's a little something for everyone here from a simple cup of joe to fancy lattes with diary free milk options. Healthy fruit smoothies are available too. One even named for the street a few steps away (Corinthian). I loved the recognition of the neighborhood! Made me miss it! \n\nA variety of baked goods from muffins, to breads, cookies and such with vegan options as well. I took home a pb cookie for the kiddos which I had to taste! It was VERY good! \n\nStandard breakfast bagel sammys were available and lucky for me a few key vegan options! It was hard to choose between the quinoa bowl, pancakes, tofu scramble and tempeh sausage. The sweet girl behind the counter suggests I do a single pancake and a side tofu scramble in order to have a taste of everything I had my eye on. Hubs and I split the sausage and both added some avocado to our meals. He used his as a side to his sausage, egg and cheese on egg bagel. \n\nWe both loved everything! We were very pleasantly surprised!! Who knew? We left thinking \"is there anything Ori Feinbush can't do successfully?!\" I mean really.... realtor, neighborhood developer and coffee shop owner with really tasty food. You go dude. \n\nPrices were extremely fair. Service with a smile. A nice, super casual place to grab some brunch or a quick drink. We will be back.", "date": "2016-07-01 11:49:49", "useful": 6, "funny": 5, "cool": 7, "user": {"user_id": "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "name": "Sari Marissa", "review_count": 1403, "yelping_since":

I came here when it was Mugshots Coffeehouse and fell in love with the decor. My sister lives close by and suggested it for lunch. OCF renovated the look and expanded it as well. It's a very open space, modern, and lots of natural light. Long tables for bigger parties, private seating to have alone time or group seating which was perfect for us. A nice sitting environment to chat with friends over good eats, a cup of tea/coffee or to read/study. There were people casually sitting with their notes, laptop or books with a drink. They have a community calendar which was nice to see. It provides a sense of caring for the community. The specials for the day were listed on a board upon entering which was a nice summary in addition to the menus and the board above the counter. The desserts were cased by the registers and all looked scrumptious! The tea - never saw so many options in one place for consumption! I definitely will have to try the coffee next time, we came for lunch. \n\n\nThe Food:\n\nTheir food is pretty darn good taste-wise and health-wise! Their options are generally local, grass-fed, or organic, gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options, which we appreciated. It felt really great knowing that we were eating well without breaking our wallets and the best part was that everything was delicious too. We ordered the Power Salad, Roasted Vegetable Sandwich - that came yummy veggie (terra) chips, a vegan peanut butter cookie that you will LOVE I promise even if you are not vegan (which we aren't), and a peanut butter cake with chocolate ganache which we split as well and all enjoyed!\n\nI would definitely recommend OCF, the staff were all ready and willing to answer any question we had. They offered suggestions based on questions they asked and they were so pleasant. Our food came out quick and service was excellent! 'll definitely come back when I am in the area again and try some other yummy menu item with some coffee.", "date": "2016-08-10 14:20:36", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "9gZ4R3EHF__2S9gSRHdr3A", "name": "Lisa", "review_count": 123, "yelping_since": "2011-07-24 03:50:14", "friends": ["o26aoEfZUzHbtyrrGYD3fw", "qURWZlrnr0ZVOtv94ghWPw", "XUYJyKmjUtG7g6xQdrmXGA", "oLu1BpDWp-2cNwb2TWQstw", "yBQEOTjFlZkjf3rcwDxAbA", "_u2A-8CdpnlXVSb5SCXOBQ", "CbA28kS-UIEZf_uPI46e1w", "I7kbTZG3LYgMdVZ6bYXh1w", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "_iHbovM6oCm3fTu8ZqTx5Q", "TbRE2l-g6FSPPXo-s-Szgg", "X68NWhjjm7YHfxkFUxwlww", "eK6nuHgVbLkDiYsoLp3ugQ", "MFVHPttPPtvd_7l7e1uKwQ", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "yKis4vn4DOl8Owr8b0FSFA", "jwnzQUCy8oBeyYUhBcv3bQ"], "elite": ["2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.83, "fans": 5}}

CH-CH!\n\nThe coffee: 'mazin'. Get it from some small roaster in the midwest if I recall correctly. Anyway it's the chronic. I had two iced americanos, one just as good as the next.\nGot a big ol' selection of teas as well. Bottled bevvies in the cooler.\n\nFood: Got a veggie potato hash for Sunday brunch, topped with two fried eggs (they don't poach eggs here...almost annoying). The rosemary potatoes were killer. Think I paid ten bucks, but was full for a while. No pork bacon here, only have beef and turkey bacon. I had the seitan bacon with my plate, it's made in-house and is a tasty alternative to breakfast meat. Most things are made in house, including baked goods though these are a bit overpriced. They do outsource for their morning pastries, like croissants and tarts. Le Fournier, I think. They look great. Also got a cooler full of sandwiches to go. \n\nStaff: Supa friendly, from the order-takers to the food-runners. They're all smiling and chatty. One of the ladies was explaining that most the staff begin as buds, which is a business plan worth replicating. Place is busy too, so they're running around and still manage to maintain good 'tudes. Much appreciated. Could also have something to do with the extraordinary\n\nSPACE: Makes sense that OCF Coffee House is associated with the realtors. The space is gorgeous, lookin' like a converted garage whose doors can open on nice days, right onto Eastern State Penitentiary. Lots of natural light, wood floors & tables, exposed brick, high ceilings. Overall great aesthetic. Bright & clean. It is a little on the loud side, and on a Sunday afternoon the place was full-up. Sitting at the table I was a bit too low to do work, but it was great for eating. Bathroom wasn't the cleanest but like I said, place was poppin' so I get it. Perhaps not the best study spot I've encountered, but just as well because it is not anywhere near where I live :). Doesn't stop the loads of laptoppers takin' over the tables. I'd suggest bringing headphones. \n\nGreat change of scenery!

We thought this would be a great spot to stop before starting our Saturday in prison. \n\nThis place gets 5 stars easily! More on that later. This place is trendy with a casual vibe. It was busy with enough seating to handle the crowd. They have coffee, tea, smoothies, lunch, and brunch. If lunch plans at another place wouldn't have been in the Saturday lineup, we would've tried brunch here. They have your basics. Pancakes, french toast, various bagels, build your own egg sandwiches, and various other things. A lot of times coffee shops try to incorporate food and forget about the coffee. This place puts coffee front and center while bringing in food. The good news... the food seems to be good too!\n\nI drink my coffee black because you're not really drinking coffee unless it's black. Just kidding. Just kidding, but seriously! Since I don't put junk in my coffee it's critical that it has a great taste. Bring up coffee around me and I'll mention this little shop in Atlanta that always has one little old lady in it. THAT was my favorite cup of coffee EVER! This OCF location is easily not far behind. It didn't give me the ATL coffee shop nostalgia blues, but it's officially the second best cup of coffee I've tried! It was perfect. I can't remember exactly what flavor they were brewing that day(August 6, 2016), but that's the coffee that makes dreams come true. \n\nI also ordered a slice of banana bread. Fresh enough to earn 4 stars by itself.\n\nEvery time I drink a cup of coffee, I always reminisce about that ATL coffee shop.

Lots of vegan and gluten free options. They have homemade veggie cream cheese, which was really good. The chai latte was awesome. The eggs are farm fresh from Green Meadow Farm, which is a local farm.  Last time I had the sweet potato pancakes, which were delicious.  They have menus for brunch and lunch with a variety of items like egg sandwiches, vegetable sandwich, bagels, and even hummus.  The hummus was great with a nice lemon flavor and it comes with homemade bagel chips. \n\nThey also have gluten-free items, such as bread and pastries!  \n\nIt is a really bright and open space with large windows. They have a lot of tables and it feels spacious, unlike the other two coffee shops on Fairmount Ave.  This is a great place to sit and talk, or meet someone for coffee.   It is SO much bigger than the old Mugshots! They did a great job re-doing the space. It is a great spot if you have a larger group, kids, need a meeting spot, or want to relax and take in the sunny space. \n\nI was very happy to hear The XX on their playlist = nice Sunday am!  The staff is very friendly and constantly clearing plates and making sure that you are taken care of.  They seem genuinely nice and friendly, not the snobby coffee shop barista attitude you get at some other places.  \n\nEverything is reasonably priced and they have a large variety for breakfast and lunch.  \n\nThey are also BYO so they provide mixers like bloody mary mix and orange juice.

I was originally drawn in by the tea selection and then stayed for the gluten-free grilled cheese.  In the week that I was in Philly, I ate here three times.\n\nStaff here are good with questions and are set up to make sure that no evil gluten touched my beautiful precious grilled cheese: gluten-free grilled cheese is baked in the oven, not fried.  This means that it takes longer but is wonderfully toasty rather than greasy, the cheese is all melty, and it's that rare sandwich that is both safe and delicious.  The only way this could be better is if they had pesto, in which case I might just die of decadence.  \n\nThe tea selection is quite good and it is all steeped at appropriate temperatures, so you're not going to get scorched or oversteeped green tea like you might at many places.  I particularly enjoyed the french breakfast, which has dehydrated strawberries in it; the green with apricot and mango; and of course the earl grey since I love pretending to be Captain Picard.  \n\nThe space itself has great light and a high ceiling, and sound carries decently such that you'll be able to hear your friend but not be stuck listening to the people next to you go on about their terrible political ideas if you don't want to.", "date": "2015-11-01 12:41:07", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "d_lpeMZNVRU0d-t50BGQ6Q", "name": "Penelope", "review_count": 267, "yelping_since": "2006-10-24 19:32:15", "friends": ["RpI9a_pglhOqpPB0NF2BYA", "FGmWx0hFD-h3YuTEql1x2Q", "ivXADOyWAwWdseTJHzaYbQ", "AVMe2V3Ru19nD_bBSsiGRQ", "LMoK9BUP6Tgfc0AeDVbZHQ", "NcIVAyjpdXVNomQej-bATA", "GKrkTMGYFiusVgB0pYqiiA", "f2FJzb1YrO2RLI-NKKnWqw", "CWhRP1PIBU-FjSUEEFCAjw", "4TCOItk-gIJROyNA5ftZ-Q", "190KwlSWfxzxKvWl5aoKAA", "ugufOYlwt2pUasEwBbcnlw", "rSsbCUYJpw0mkqZ-Hwlj3Q", "mGTLj3FGCCtXAK8-W4Cw5g", "y_Q6AvCo_qlUb7WIyPP8TA", "VTR-U9JZ4PdLqqJm2gJ5mw", "5IdSwwjII5GWUCXCgbIS0A", "G0SMRIL2L0n8YURL484PFA", "OEMLUDIlVywXI28Eq5Rstg", "zJ-kIfUqnyDcJpamumDlRg", "6JoqpSndFILKDnwKpJrSeA", "RKULSOrIvvYpDmtuYXEXzA", "CZoFlkO9uqhE2soP1sJP-Q", "UUqGHQFu2tQDGv5r3yJWPA", "w850gjGAL8fOy3C3eh9a9w", "pXeebMvieVuxb1P2DnnB0Q", "ph16HnMAZAuRmnBDCNjrMw", "ALrtGexCZuwAnAk3t9Sy0g", "jYvyfDJg_3nu5eAxGhOCJw", "kkrp6mK4bHl5n7Vm4Bn0vg", "lMY8NBPyzlPbbu-KBYfD9A", "lnBY0zXSWG8q8-JZLTI46Q", "idYYmk_Z1mVKaFT4OiWX8A", "MR1UmrgO938K3EnGBUZdng", "qhbzoef7wkBHj9UL9Oxb3Q", "4Z_xWLhoPJ6WsSoVmbNx9A", "3nNjiBNb63OYThauysn9Lg", "J1gc2iMG-xAF9GCxZvcdKA", "jhvreOViehq5zA4p2dgSVg", "f034fbf0ZZP0tlRKhlpImg", "HjXeOGdzKCfIelhpNjsdzA", "SQeFWFiL0R0btFDEJca0Qw", "d8uIIxFhHmSZgxsCZ4rQWw", "gJUrWiDoxOgJvRJeWay8gg", "U8f06vx7p7ttV6MgxSLCyw", "k5F0vGdVWwYCUyLJi89ukg", "yDgBhl1QH-z7UMb6i98SOA", "fW-mpoEAZfSj0IY_JnLNpw", "1FgTr6aTL7W0tHSTYoR51g", "rTy_AevgQnfqV-b0cajSqQ", "P9dY5bhJvkJhjzYbA7cXTQ", "HbtDu8f3fxT6A3xubLYfGQ", "625lP42x64CQois2PkqCTA", "T68PUOXE8kzjsDQbOYjjbg", "f7jg69qMuLExp9SMh-lYwA", "Dg-3-ot03BJy7jq9McNP8w", "xq39qAPXilmaaJNu8Tj-lg", "dfI0samzsscjY31An702fA", "Mp9dsUhdBWPMMjJ9riBIZQ", "RbMta8rXN3nBaKbloDWeng", "VvVasSDpQR2DoEDl_wmbNg", "Z2Sf8WoWJULVe7YQ8iSfAw", "8klNL9dQjZ_iq5bzTINMtw", "Jn4EAp5oCrlncQIA6DyPOQ", "1vh3MGM67d8HG2ZrkQfOXQ", "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "kzDzdbPupHiglDzs9HD0vA", "RENDi6PaDTaVzJFMxb1IQw", "E00m8mNCgjqkovcBH42o8g", "FSfQzpkOripe90CLG5_MVw", "hK2gYbxZRTqcqlSiQQcrtQ", "Kf5PVQUdDvQYf-MXoeWqZA", "vIuEBI6oTyNxFWkW0fQWEg", "s7jnxE3-9JZKEG3csmJ2-w", "ID0U33c-aINV6hbiQ1MvmA", "hcJzh-FFDEfYKGpyM0TpZA"], "elite": ["2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"], "average_stars": 4.11, "fans": 16}}

However, I rarely stop by for breakfast, which is what I did this past weekend. Food was probably 4/5, but they're quick and have plenty of tables/wifi/coffee.\n\nAtmosphere: VERY casual. This is the neighborhood coffeeshop most people go to for studying or meeting up with some friends. Plenty of 2-people tables with outlets all around the building. They also have a huge space, there aren't many coffee shops of this size around the city. They have a few larger tables for bigger parties, but I'm sure you could always just ask to push a few tables together as well.\n\nFood:  I usually order coffee, also had an everything bagel with jalepeno cream cheese and a side of potatoes. Coffee's always good and strong, bagel was standard, nothing new, potatoes are on the soft and mushy side. All in all, food is ok here, but the coffee and overall environment is a plus.\n\nDrinks: get coffee! they have a bunch of specialty drinks as well, but i've never ordered those\n\nService: Great service, quick, efficient. Very friendly staff all around!\n\nPro tip: bring your laptop charger, and you can spend as much time as you want here while you do work or study! there is so much study space.

This place continues to disappoint!\n\nMy first experience included a $5 soy latte that was half foam.  The person at the register was less than friendly and a bit stand off-ish.  \n\nThe owner was extremely frazzled the second time I tried this place.  For whatever reason they didn't get the shop open on time and were scrambling to get things done (didn't even have any coffee brewed).  Absolutely NO customer service on this visit.\n\nToday was my third (and FINAL) experience.....apparently THEY DON't OFFER DECAF....ANYTHING!!  I recently gave up caffeine and now enjoy a triple decaf espresso over ice with unsweetened almond milk.  Unfortunately, they lost a customer today and because they don't cater to all coffee lovers - I marched right down the street to Starbucks.  \n\nI was a barista for 3 years back in the day and to me this is just CRAZY!!\n\nIt's a bummer because I believe in supporting local businesses (even if they are WAY overpriced).

One day, however, there was some chaos. I got in what I thought was a line, and when it was time to place my order, this is what happened. \n\"Hi.

I did ask for two.\"\nThe woman is now furious. \"Well I only charged you for one.\"\nI pull out a $20 bill, which is more than enough to pay for the correction.

Since I suffer from an affliction known as 'hanger' (anger resulting from hunger), Lady Mary suggested the nearest geographical place to our location, Cafe Ole. \n\nWe walked into bright room, full of hippies, and free spirits from the continent. Joy. \n\nApparently there is no table service. We arrived at that conclusion after sitting at our table for 10 minutes with no greeting. The sign directing orders to be taken at the counter was either backpacking across eastern Europe, or was never conceived. We waited in line to place food orders as elderly couples caressed each other, and looked longly into each other's eyes. Nothing to whet the old appetite like a long haired Spaniard snogging his 4th wife. Hanger was rapidly setting in, but I couldn't see my way clear to order any food from this establishment, and opted only for a coffee. Lady Mary, being much more gentile, granted Ole the benefit of the doubt, and ordered the lox plate. \n\nTangential Point: Where does the food come from??? I can't see a kitchen, or any room in the building for a kitchen. Perhaps it is prepared in the basement? \n\nThis tangent doesn't much matter, as there didn't seem to be much cooking going on anyway. Lady Mary's dish was a crudely assembled miss-mash of lettuce, old vegetables, and a spot of salmon. 'Worth every bit of twelve quid.' I remarked sarcastically. Even my good lady was unable to pretend that this plate, and indeed place, was anything other than bollux. Hanger got the better of me that day, but I shall live to fight again...just not here.  \n\nPerhaps Cafe Ole is the scandal in bohemia to which Conan Doyle referred??", "date": "2014-06-13 16:12:18", "useful": 0, "funny": 6, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "JlUFYRdIvbElmUqQX8wF8w", "name": "Jeremy", "review_count": 112, "yelping_since": "2012-04-05 15:11:08", "friends": ["N4WD9p53f5ltdLvWfVuPPg", "R7oqm48wW0h0n2veJOdJlw", "CTWyE8SM9EXMcCiMVnz5OA", "63eZawys5jnk_RjA9mGZqQ", "ZtKll2ySQfGftaXqAFe8Zg", "Rr8q4cB14FOAKOhsdSuHMA", "aAeOv0ll7gJJVMk94ffPKQ", "EQpFHqGT9Tk6YSwORTtwpg", "cntN1wM3P4LsL74E_ESrBw", "slpyLHWsvPXwj1XPoyjugQ", "1JfHD63MIZbOjrYQ74vzvQ", "cIVmIJD7nIiEcVGamfBoVw", "i_DV0qtD0JZHZ7swhaR7Ng", "lu12uo_PjohGOhDuV16gKQ", "Ia6W2Ml3QsFVPvh__38BNQ", "LiX260mfnPgbtfHkOXCWiQ", "DkYgL344vM57LJQLQvywgA", "DGBEkOjpmKGEaJnN34_ILA", "7MqZnQPUbEkZqhgSJ2T0bw", "gP20yP4taj8EKLdV-P-fzw", "fLA4QKxEgjOuWZs04VZ6KQ", "nS4GMmrb7SmnsLh8dg3DnQ", "VeeAPub9GS5Q3GdAD6AQeg", "BPtpR_xdlMnfUqHrORyD9A", "GRYegpWUUnaerQLqlv4b3g", "-CW8d0B6pTDLFu7xHbtKdA", "-qAVRQzvL2cNt1S4Umn4sw", "RYKF-828hPSbjlsGw8ZPpw", "ofg_8N53_zak9gyVv9eUHg", "5AWxeQ_aOZgP541WcwEW4A", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "1k2ilG84PtPAm9cP_EQHjQ", "LrWgKZ0jfOIJbCv1hVm5iw", "zg5D4CZhnZJEU_RWU-aM9g", "vRIHldZTi8vgOy-wsBWKPg", "4I75CfHLoj4dFwx4f7CoeQ", "yOLXoEGrpIxsWGfihJjZFA", "Ru3VD7T8fpGHs2pEyw6V1w"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.46, "fans": 18}}

On a previous visit, I asked for a toasted croissant, and received a sad, squished croissant paddy (I guess their only means of warming up anything is by panini press). I asked if they would remake it. One of the Baristas propped up the panini press with some sandwiches, and then the other barista promptly removed the sandwiches so that the second croissant got squashed too (womp womp). On my last visit the barista behind the counter couldn't be bothered to help me until she was done counting all of her coin tips, and trading them out of the till for different denominations.

I'm sorry, but I've worked in food service, and counting your tips when there are customers waiting is a cardinal sin. \n\nIt's too bad they haven't yet been able to successfully replace the old baristas.

I understand that coffee is like gas when it comes to prices and sometimes the market dictates it. However the food prices have really gone up as well. Ex.  Got a breakfast wrap 3 ingredients.egg,cheese and 1 link of turkey sausage cut up. The online menu said 7.25, got to the shop and the menu on the wall  said 8.25. Ok I figure the online  menu was old...real price 11.75. I ask about the price on the wall shoulders are shrugged and I'm told \" oh yeah we have to get around to updating those prices\".\n I walk out thinking why am I coming here anymore I just paid $16 for an egg sandwich and coffee, the high price coffee is just ok and it isnt like you walk out smiling because of the nice customer service and great food.

Both the exterior and interior decor are quaintly charming and homey. Upon stepping in, the wonderful smells of shakshuka, baked goods, and coffee fill your senses and any attempts to resist ordering something is futile. \n\nPros:\n-- Food is obviously delicious\n-- Service is fast and staff are efficient\n-- I ordered a Lox Bagel Sandwich and requested very little cream cheese. They are the only place that has actually understood what \"little\" means!!! So Cafe Ole, thank you for making my Lox breakfast the Lox breakfast of my dreams!\n-- They bring the food to you after you order and take your plates away when you're done\n\nCons:\n-- Outlets are accessible to only a few tables really. Perhaps if you have a longer charger, you could reach some.\n-- The high table near the door is the most spacious in terms of surface area and has 4 outlet jacks, but it is right next to the door so be prepared to constantly be hit with cold area if you dare sit there\n-- Cafe Ole is super busy on the weekends (regardless of time), so it's not an ideal place to do work if you easily get distracted\n-- If you're doing work with a friend, I wouldn't recommend Cafe Ole since the tables are small and it just barely holds 2 Mac laptops\n\nCafe Ole is definitely a place I would go to grab a quick bite for either eat-in or to go, but not somewhere I would try to sit down in and do work (at least on the weekends, anyway).

The barista suggested a Chai tea which I tried (Peppermint Chai actually) and it was very very good.  I also ordered a chicken, mozzarella and pesto panini (which is such an odd combo w/ the tea) and it was a perfect snack as it was much smaller than their sandwiches.\n\nThe hummus plate is still designed exactly the same after all these years which is a relief b/c it is the best f-ing hummus in this town.  I didn't have the room that day to commit to it though.  In the past when I was entertaining at home, I would bring my own plate to the cafe a day before and have them make me a hummus plate to go.  Gayuela (sp?) is the owner and very cool.\n\nThe music is insanely loud and 90% of the time it's horrendous, but I appreciate that it may be the only Israeli coffee shop around.  The smells are nice and not overwhelming (like in Starbucks which makes me nauseous), and you never feel rushed.  It does get very crowded and would be a challenge with a group to hear each other.

Speaking of getting things done, no one bothered me or gave me a second glance as I read D. H. Lawrence's the Rainbow (well, the introduction), and a communist newspaper. Both are good qualities in a cafe, at least by my book of books.\n\nSpeaking of which, the majority of the customers/visitors were indeed doing work--reading, such as myself, or using a computer, or engaged in some group activity. There were a couple couples that chilled outside, as the December Globally-Warmed Climate allowed for that to be comfortable. All in all, there are probably ten tables, including the two outside. But the place is a bit crowded, with tables each fitting around four people total, so I would not recommend large groups.\n\nThe food was fine. Check out the semi-strange selection of sandwiches and omelets. I tried the Brie Sandwich, which include Brie (not sure the kind), granny smith apples, on toasted raisin bread. It wasn't the most complex thing in the world but I've never heard anything like it so I gave it a shot. Great bargain--four bucks. There were also bigger sandwiches on hoagey-style rolls, and salads, and soups. Also, sandwiches come with free salad or chips. I went with the salad. A lot of cucumbers but I hear those things are good for you, so I'm over my marked distaste for them.\n\nThe barista, or counter help, was a nice woman who seemed helpful and friendly to most customers. I'd definitely go back, and in fact, let's switch that tense over--I will definitely go back. It helps that the place is located in one of the hippest neighborhoods in Philadelphia--Northern Liberties--and it helps that there's a lot of cool galleries/bars nearby, Market Street a five minute walk southwards, and highways on the other side, tearing the neighborhood apart.

And yelp pointed me here. \n\n3.5 stars\n\nPS, i love this part of OC now! I haven't been in a few years, but now that i work here, i love exploring the streets. \n\nIt was a super hot day out... an iced coffee was needed. The place was a bit understaffed for a late lunch crowd. However, the one worker was not phased and hustled well and didn't break a sweat. The place felt and looked more of a neighborhood'ish spot where people would meetup to eat, drink, chat. \n\nI don't think it was wise having the front door open on a hot day, with no central air (only a window unit from what i saw). So it wasn't super cool inside, but not uncomfortably hot. \n\nI got my iced coffee and first sip smacked me in my face! The flavor was super bold and jarring. I've been getting cold brews most of the summer, so switching to an iced coffee was a shock to my palette. It took a little bit getting use to the acidity and deep coffee flavor, but overall, i did feel it had a burnt finish to it. I'll update my review when i come back to try food and their hot coffee.\n\n***Update***\n\nStopped by for a cup of coffee earlier this week. \n\nThe place was really busy despite being 1:40pm (after lunch rush?) but there were still many people ordering food and drinks. There were two workers that day, one was somewhat new i guess as she asked how to do some things. Everything went smoothly and again, i feel this establishment has a neighborhood vibe and following....all good things. \n\nMy small black coffee was on the pricier side ($2 and change), but i assume its because of location/rent, not a deal breaker. I usually get coffee in my mug so it stays hot (or cold) for a few hours. I poured the coffee into my mug and saw there was a lot of grinds. I can only believe it was later in the day and they never made a new batch of coffee because they were closing early  (2pm). It was a bit of a turn off BUT, the coffee did taste pretty good. Hence, the bump to a solid 4. I had lunch already, so i didn't order anything but i feel like iwant to the both times i've come in.", "date": "2015-09-16 03:34:57", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "Wk_xohYcysEWnkhOp3sBSA", "name": "Hoang", "review_count": 358, "yelping_since": "2009-02-16 21:18:52", "friends": ["OmL2bjLvvRxg1brM5Pehgw", "hP3Y6-m1aA_UZaa4X3T1cQ", "BrfStKKOVtT-BZGuT9qJwA", "JTqQ9C9S2Qc8_aHtO1965g", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "z7whl1KjkBqugUZRG2G69A", "eUlLKiRbX3k4VS3Ko_WxTA", "IhtRI074XXiv54cCODlLdA", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "p7POoguI7_aGWdwOJ_0bvg", "3-6rWmwcMZroo_VYygOTqA", "WheWOIL2MJQDXoAEWY8RHQ", "t8lkeiI5ZE5EWbHdI2FwBQ", "AnEPqys9NYHiHZG28CvFjQ", "HxyLRaoH9PS09M6R3rV-EQ", "BzcTU6B58qKZIbiikQBirQ", "v98WXw1EToiuPIxtE0aekQ", "x4dFJHNzZVnmLBbiaoIF0A", "F4Mur55GwMNbV00-DyAy6w", "kV98zs6zkL8DXtx6h1_wrQ", "RqXxCyA2DK6gMVz7QnyiDA", "DvX2HfOnGx4tQWlaAB2olg", "NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A", "-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw", "D2VBAKQjN2L5P7RxflQFMw", "AVEJb-lCEY_WPExMoBr65g", "bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA", "f-QXnHjEX-txhBHnTxJiuw", "i3jcM4k0rjUYrnPD-Pg5fQ", "N8ITUUDRBpo1hTNDvk1byA", "l6kWqlYQqVm7b1bM-iGYqA", "EouCKoDfzaVG0klEgdDvCQ", "u7lGgwVTmPaILJ0C1CwnHg", "RKG7aVka0eqPNyvi7vTkOg", "23jXJGZ6YaHdXmMKGpJOgQ", "RKULSOrIvvYpDmtuYXEXzA", "mVkopn2FcSNOSrirL84v0w", "hfZiJgz6ipKp2oBQbtnehg", "PJLzbA6p2brE-jJYJ0fl8w", "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "mIsZHbewRk_aY1Gjdohkwg", "fs28C8xiMn2l-J5xM-rk_g", "sTYbNsv022stynVVzrsj9A", "R95jUAYcnhesh9L5kCSeSA", "1bjo-xG3tKF5rQjRx5zW4Q", "KBLRmuXeLI5b6DUdtYib3A", "NFeNXGbZWRCe6qMEppNdRw", "18IfGto90jqD-FotHqq90w", "1ZFOZV7zA-6yZFZWoZSwxA", "hNc9ICYav-FcOkcKaGBZDw", "d8FwfuFM9SJA3kU_cIQ3aw", "mNB-RGqN62h9edxkSqk81g", "gPv6bJ7Ob0-07DRhSbV4XA", "xjtOgEi9ajcfbpQdMUbZZw", "iyI93tcSuQ54ckGyjaLP8g", "q9uTZRlWg9v-WG2v76gGcg", "BJKWprcdWcx07bah8yfobw", "6U6AWjbQBRaZkeT80K4_zA", "ItNR1CxsYcyiMDENM-eYqA", "IIB_s9SiBCtUf8gXeFKKUQ", "RgDVC3ZUBqpEe6Y1kPhIpw", "sPzvgLUFoGaPUbIKtx73mw", "IxoM8mRDv0T9J1SI5fFlQQ", "rzCiyp1IRi3ewcRuUPR7AA", "iY262MNxieewhtFInDY4Rg", "N9hqTPQu2bmI8c2Pj8F1ww", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "KVtb6ebSbexQPMmIgxDL_g", "OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "5RHa6ARjqHnjkk2puc5y_w", "eiiXoxbl2nzTy3VTsOd-Qw", "b5GDJjsN1O7D_K27Zscyjg", "GO_HbtRE63mdZXIVmidVmg", "VVs0OoDD7ikOS5Qtme6YQQ", "ynO2E2xuey8iT_q8y-Dy8Q", "67jznGBPOlZiZfC71RipQA", "qFwJ08Fs1Yvk-cJ98j7xsw", "gzQaaoPzzQi83QMS7XdrKg", "syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw", "zOg0wEW2adv_vwuYt1LHOw", "QHuf0mWbHmTiWTzrc9o2Xg", "BS3cZAKF2Cuacqd-NQzUTg", "a9-3NDi9_rm9y8hjJHgM8g", "CAElBD0ReYRnSIItIoMhKQ", "T43MnZ-ZUuRrG3ECzqPMJw", "J5UPYTxWBvlToYtX6T-bWg", "EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw", "vU9_lZqJQIR8btUYw7fqxA"], "elite": ["2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"], "average_stars": 3.83, "fans": 24}}

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I saw that they had good reviews, so I was hopeful.\n\nWe were surprised at how busy they were, considering the weather and the holiday weekend, but the staff is clearly used to a rush of people, because they handled the crowd effortlessly. Even though it was very busy, we didn't feel cramped at our table, or rushed to finish our meal.\n\nThey have a wide array of freshly baked goods, breakfast options, fruit cups, salads, and sandwiches. They also offer standard coffee options. I was planning on getting a latte until I saw the varieties of chai flavors that they offer, and went with a dulce de leche chai latte w/ soymilk. They have non-dairy milk options (almond or soy, from what I recall) for a small surcharge. It was very delicious and not overly sweet. My friend ordered the spice chai latte with almond milk, and said that it was also very good. \n\nFor breakfast, two of us chose the pesto omelette, which had pesto mixed into the eggs, and was filled with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and olives. It came with a warm roll and a side salad. The bread came with a dipping sauce with oil & sesame seeds, but I am not sure what it was called, or what else was in it. The omelette was fresh and very tasty. The third person in our party ordered the egg & cheese on a croissant, and had them add spinach to it. She said that it was very tasty & satisfying.\n\nI would definitely consider stopping by here again sometime. I think I'd like to try one of the fresh croissants next time around!", "date": "2018-05-31 16:01:41", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "2UH-1Dlml_3wLlcICfalWA", "name": "Dominic", "review_count": 111, "yelping_since": "2012-11-24 19:18:28", "friends": ["_AN5jkTP3PV6Vyoe2Y7u-Q", "Vw2mqNQzG3yPuGhSRWjohg", "IXnjX2apmcsAm6kLZY4BLw", "RnV6Ohrf8Td6GDKa167xxg", "w7dWeK2SKc4AJH00pgm8qw", "CdAf_1dzgQ3zV6pxx4IU8w", "1N9A5z-07MimZBU-o69kuw", "044B9bYKblMk8lBgcroVSw", "QLpQ8ynY8Vxi9OK-vGy8ng", "BmRgnDrHFAQGcClwJbldrg", "dyAaNxc4QGNxOIYz5uSy4g", "-vbla5U57-Dymiu3e11-2A", "Xu7itIAz90gMsN33mzbO9A", "a9buGrspntL1cKaNZtv9zQ", "BwascNQD_4oVJpis_AxDQw", "bNjAsdsi3gjSzK30r-j-ng", "F9JHqWXe9b4I5wOBQSuhbQ", "a-r2F5U4jeOR-jpR-Ycb-w", "uro0BmbWaNq3hrCWRwCkmw", "z23vo7x8QHrbx_AHKHKAlg", "3oxQeXhov8CGZzuq5HDN4w", "TDNIX2g1jAOQw-MW5d_KAg", "vLSKfxquToSdB7NL09XRUQ", "XJQgiI3pfgWCk8sEYGE-jw", "QqhT4pLw_ZY99sGMp657nA", "uKNuZbbY0vZb_p5-44Ppdg", "QnLdXzpyScAf0m5f0FDL_Q", "6eHlYrYSPDNlvvtEvmIwpg", "Zk6K1sB3nsFtfaaRhFJ1MA", "XD5fdn1lWp_1G2uIPVFLBQ", "h4NH2JJG0Rk7KBY2AL8Hlg", "OatuHhCraRD0XDPc-yx5uw", "aqiLPslrUS6p5hw3ym4RJg", "n3E67ZsEDzKkQzObPNmYzA", "y4lpRMjx5TrK5564j8AwsQ", "VzgNVhoKk0Axwi1u4g_qUg", "yEElH4dFjHVqHBfb_lRb9A", "rjTliyIyc56Oestk-I2N9g", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "p1UqpRtfge6RNkUB4VNWhw", "rmTiyhGP4t3FT973gK6t6w", "0RX9w878R80Ok5iPrNBv3g", "LNQLEgJGHx2sXJYH1AgnWQ", "iDlf4Mu7ppj81sVxN9R0dg", "-hwIz6kTrH1AeZvBrbXJqw", "vpN36DoXoY8ZDhyujEHcCg", "2bEDIXHzynXQP2_YJS754g", "9PWruBp8PY1TJTxoxiycSg", "TIFuTbhRcrn3k_reUZR3iw", "beKaXYEmLGRlsIKHLndSGg", "xVdRDNttuh_estjgkMKU9w", "hho5fOjmCk8KesPj51aa_g", "A9-dVNOu82umHrbqVKBM7Q", "OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g", "o530gxOkSGmj8cXbRL6AQQ", "mIWi6iSbDD7T0isWFBFLTw", "tUW0AXg4C3H9TP5lyhoQuA", "6IMqQQmLBrcjuf4EZoj0IA", "5hT3tIClV6-qO0Wl9ADCNw", "-8uDneh8BA4SM28w-DhcCg", "s4s0qf7T30W--QLM3gyWKg", "N13eFEA69kE_jE1fhuDqVg", "ryxa_on9OIOK9fdDSx_c9w", "ExUFBfvybQcf1as3Gx5h8g", "LFVUr3-8F38Vo22IsXIaqA", "wsU5iKIv7YxmGlYEt6dvvA", "kCRy5_ebFemftLRBOR2vBQ", "8L7iN4z45SoMHv-8uASKtA", "ZNlyxwOpFaiPYMjCEQ5woA", "msyy-8gYzelsKJmCNQIByA", "V1wPX-4ugSsb1z5pCf3h_w", "PFHZz4j0RGcr-4byyijeOg", "5eoRMAlG7QhQa9zya67TvA", "48lrLoht_wxS0PZN4Q7xlA", "LY2by0pHtUnqZeQZQKxU1g", "IHZLrOLZhocIf3X6xQkMbQ", "Wtb5zhJRsqXXS__5uuJStQ", "5nagrYuS4oxsvirHpzqYBg", "EIYpgtr135tC3h9aXeLnwQ", "OeXcRkIW1gQxBHqWqtq5FQ", "25WHb3fPZlicGDke5XrCfw", "uiwvcQ6ev1EsFzNoitteWQ", "VhYpZY6BvRu46oa4k4nuOQ", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "hrTuA7AeODXG8rt-xOfB4w", "9PrjJK1-Z2AC3H39JLUeVg", "ZV7CRmwjeaqrJH5oINEV1A", "FyaR35w2tjG-og1JA9wexA", "T7kNl4_Rszm60m3nCGhRew", "rApwXSXrWJ52nywzgwN54Q", "--vUSB1jJkSB0Y4jXEmimg", "z-SlUVaneYHgejvzzO1xaQ", "UIX5TEYEZsgnxjTS3xvdGA", "rvIoySIANxRlsrQwc41IYQ", "ahiYFyGxLQTx7VdjkccFIQ", "Epea00ht6A_d4wW1DAcDvw", "n7pWK2QnWiovh1mhv3cnzQ", "AZjAgsjvQ58c7AmQoLlTXg", "GnCLBk1XTp_EUUN86I8cTA", "Jn6LU2pG_Gg0cJkvjcHTHg", "cIpDQH-FM-v5lAdAsQNSiw", "ZIXtrQMZ4G7hA1rgBULZ3g", "Nlqdu4OLXXIlRA5piNst0A", "CYlPO_Qzxw8UpyvaOM1DVg"], "elite": ["2018", "2019", "20", "20"], "average_stars": 3.95, "fans": 9}}

I searched for \"omelette\" on caviar and this place came up. MULTIPLE omelette options that extend beyond boring and standard omelette options. There was one with PESTO literally mixed into the omelette itself which surrounded tomatoes, mozarella, and olives. I was sold (I typed old by accident, fml) immediately. Bubba ordered salsa omelette (brie, salsa, and basil) with sausage. \n\nUnfortunately caviar took literally FOREVER to come, like about an hour. There was also an issue of confusion regarding where our residence actually is. By the time it arrived, our omelettes were ice cold requiring microwaving. I thought mine was absolutely delicious and ate the entire thing. My fiance was absolutely repulsed by the temperature and subsequent texture of the omelette and could barely stomach eating any of it. \n\nLuckily for this place, I am the one writing this review and thus a positive review. On second thought, our choice to order an omelette for delivery was probably questionable. This is a good place to order brunch if you're brave and hopefully have a good caviar delivery person.", "date": "2018-12-20 20:08:51", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id":

For those of you who aren't familiar, Shakshuka is a traditional Israeli dish made with the sometimes hard to find in the US--\"Harissa\" spice--and stewed with tomato, then topped with q perfect poached egg. They give you warm pita to dunk and sop up this juicy goodness and they now have both traditional, vegetable, and chicken and olive. To. die. For.\nAs opposed to the more hippster-fied digs around south philly and fishytown, old city with it's \"once so cool it's now not cool anymore \" vibe--the baristas at this cafe still tend to be quite friendly and chatty. While I was here, most folks had cleared out of town for the July 4th holiday , leaving the town and the cafe blissfully quieter than normal. When it's busy try to snag a table in the back nook along the banquette or the cafe tables when they keep the doors ajar for a nice breeze. Also not to be missed are labna (creamy cheese like stuff spread on bread and topped with olives and a drizzle of olive oil and spices  (sounds too simple to be good but something makes it special ) , the salads, the panini made to order in many varieties, and also the fresh brewed flavored iced teas with flavors like Rasberry and tropical green tea. Since it was so quiet I even managed to have a great discussion about metaphysics  and politics with the lovely Steph with the long braid, before ducking out just in time to miss my ex boyfriend and his new girlfriend popping in for one of their yummy cappuccinos--come for the food, stay for the coffee and pastries :)", "date": "2016-07-02 00:16:28", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user":

Most of the places I have been visiting have been nothing short of 5 stars and this tiny cafe is on that list! You may ask why so many stars for a little coffee shop? Let me paint a picture in your mind...\n\nYou are tried and thirsty from the heat. You turn down 3rd street to steer clear of the crowds on Market and come across a little shaded cafe. You order an iced coffee and iced green tea with subtle hints of mint and lemon. Suddenly, you feel refreshed! \n\nIf the beverages of this cafe aren't enough, you can look to their tables outside on the sidewalk or the comfiness of the chairs toward the back, where you can sit and chat and not be bothered.\n\nI know what you're thinking. So what? You can get that anywhere. Well here's where the five stars come in. \n\nSince that iced tea was so damn good and refreshing, we decided to order another one only large this time. Instead our server informed us that there were free refills and that he could just refill each of our cups with iced tea. I don't know about you, but this is kind of a rare thing to have happen at an independent coffee house. I mean even Starbuck's (a large corporation that has mediocre drinks at best) charges you for refills (I know unless you have a SBUX card, but still!) I was just pleasantly surprised of how nice our barista was and how he didn't charge us for the refills.

I've just transcended back to one  of my favorite times with Cafe Ole. \n\nI came here for coffee only, as I planned to bring with some friends later. I'm a good window shopper, so I looked at the menu just for fun. I was stopped dead in my tracks when I saw 'the' item. SHAKSHUKA. \n\nWhat is it? You ask. Let me explain. This is a middle eastern dish where a few eggs are cracked into boiling hot tomato sauce amazingness. The eggs cook in the sauce, you sprinkle with herbs and then it's a Moroccan festival in your mouth. If you haven't had it, you must. \n\nThe only time I've had it was on a trip to Israel, which was one of those life-changing events that Shakshuka brings me back to. Cafe Ole brought me back and in grateful.\n\nEnough about me... This place is adorable. There is upbeat middle eastern music playing low, but high enough to make you get a sway in your hips. The place is decorated with uplifting colors and they serve on yellow interesting plates--- just reminds you that ambiance is everything. The employees are super nice and the place is usually full. Cafe Ole is a small establishment with character- something lacking in the huge corporate monster coffee joints.

The waitress/hostess behind the counter who took our order probably could've perked up a little bit, as she seemed a bit moody/distracted/inattentive.  It's fine, as you only have to order and then you can go find a seat and wait for your food to be called.\n\nThey have an assortment of chai tea lattes, which are super delicious, a bit sweet, and surprisingly a little filling.  When our food came out, we were shocked at how much they give you - a full plate of 'shakshuka' - two poached eggs covered in tomatoes, onions, garlic, and a tomato-based warm sauce.  The two sesame buns it comes with are super flaky and melt in your mouth delicious, along with this creamy butter with olive oil to dip it in.  It was by far one of the tastiest brunches I've had, as the flavors and aromas work so well together.  It does pack a punch, not in a spicy way, but in a flavorful way.  It can be a bit messy and definitely eat it quick, because as soon as it starts to get lukewarm, it doesn't taste as good, as the texture of the dish also changes.\n\nOverall, a fantastic spot and I'll definitely be back to have more!", "date": "2017-06-09 19:31:04", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "L9MlCg2yg8AYDrSz6_UDFg", "name": "Sunny", "review_count": 389, "yelping_since": "2010-09-17 17:24:01", "friends": ["bL76sCeMYN1puCgIu37JHQ", "R9la_jTIXEY4JBI5F8f1fQ", "2iQOfqz-bVoBfb6P2hLylA", "LYOvyedhKD3eqs4dJrp6yQ", "2Bn504zvZIqIOjjBzmj2FQ", "_otPDGFmszOeU1RXnarV2g", "R95jUAYcnhesh9L5kCSeSA", "_hW83nxqx1HrFOlNqqL1IQ", "lR3H1RYKOCYZ0Awf3J933A", "HNReGVpMIKSpOzuZXyP4Jw", "H3S3r7rNepjCc5tWOGLCEw", "Umlu2gkBVVYbRoiiKb06rQ", "D3zcUIJbtAtg7Cb4_BPKfw", "2XmM5xHH0zNBg7z7mVWPMg", "j6PirYScs8xVzHIsif_bKQ", "xLSTszQHVefHmgVKD0hStg", "7zuRuBKovY2_q0Eyks9kZQ", "60Bexub9_yP0aQl2I3koKw", "fUMfR-ljz1904fJLlxKSow", "9dJPJdhGgmyZ9sz2VhyhaA", "gQa9W4ss8nv8PSV4Kscg5A", "8rL9WWZAGi5Hxzjs2TmPIg", "VYEaosXs1H0j0c4pRmC8Pg", "Mj95sJVSV6I_I8mwgossSA", "IMZrutI3hpIwRmVMUDRd-A", "zvq6qxc2IVA08jaUelUMRw", "NEKGNxPq7gwhvxyiOQiV2w", "UKI5z_fsLZADk-mJfd8OYQ", "HNNnhz6EFLdp6raK74T3Cw", "PIluTC0lnCx4TC0DXWmB0w", "Mbp3KeSkPW0LC0ZXy_JtXw", "FyWQ7Zonws_ppf06Nhu8zA", "8YdoFUKLJSrnQQk-BcuL5Q", "UqsyUqUzx-XBlBNxR6tR-A", "WCLB0O4pVuZzy566_e7IIg", "eHuTAF90cbLi3JBKDOkiLQ", "bZYGAnskSUxOAH0C-dACcw", "l3JiQmrbNApZWl7W8aggEg", "G3lbvjRXX9hfVKI9DiX_DA", "S3isKTsm7Z_YGEuZMxo_ig", "gKPfHr9D0HityOUP_CpO_w", "dWGBXVofKAuCc_-5JNjl8g", "lU9v6r4bo6nh1i5z4Z-BDg", "HF4_lFDs8Ci1hBGIGAQ2KA", "QLh66IrhezQBYKh9AOsGpg", "MfDGBpOHbWdy0KFRe9Y8yQ", "SGM-H22UmCQwxFEth8FCrg", "Cr1-jItXYxrpeuG4abvkzg", "Z0BXoRJfp4C5BX_hBsl3hw", "EMMGWfR4yi0WCYRebIC45A", "rPsWIl8nRcpxYuUVJbfVAQ", "A9lxrHGdE7lg_ANV-f1sUw", "5ziHl-nXggY90xFQUSI1cg", "18IfGto90jqD-FotHqq90w", "Dv4k0KDcnZ20VL-WVwEysA", "36yJtLsle_c_Ipn-Lnw9Nw", "h2LtQ1s5X20d0yrdqUMJ0Q", "pv-q73AyQSG_nLXSziZxwA", "GJHgbuXmy-Q5eSzkDH5V3w", "Cdm8LUt1w7-qAZYeI209cQ", "UnrszBht5Z2KeqUZgxBKRw", "kkrJPRxdUme47_ZbSwGVDg", "Z7ynzwiv3J_tSfIRbDvzlQ", "YWr8FdfhkQnf7FKABcCgRw", "wbY7GnXcUj4vCsLaoGpTdw", "anDoS05SPRkXjUWxGxiSog", "HX7-6s2A1LZo4ZsU6KnclA", "D7NecAV6v4fQQt7CocerGQ", "IEBVJIsGwgxVfFpvo7DX3A", "WHFoVH2Q9bsBAZL27K1a_g", "lwJhmwwLjdaaKXVkNbzzfQ", "wRe4Q-pMqgfd7Dj4uQc6NA", "jPCOaCN7ACHZglU-KiQErA", "L6LxxqFTCqh91AeTnGhfxQ", "_yvmDZD2V0c1dWem2LzR3g", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "16xIUxD8TbCJSOrBf7lnbw", "dmIiVMjltf3abzGuSx369A", "3gHC7VtTIf8OmNP00Djp6w", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "UqlZbpZY1DaDF9pZczVPSA", "HfHk3lRKPy7mv9tYv0ytBQ", "bTmsFBWzWUShJad6sxaZ3w", "t7R2npYmGrKTCsycALT4Iw", "pRaRXDm-ie5fnpfdILPFbw", "Kf5PVQUdDvQYf-MXoeWqZA", "1-HwJHIYHzkkTYDEzr4XJQ", "aCxk_5jOiCKuvYzbLDHq_A", "IIB_s9SiBCtUf8gXeFKKUQ", "UvGrtngH9e8MFhaWznAXww", "BvyIaF9FbopBBbft0n3P0A", "_jyScZdRzqq0cT8CT_CLzA", "AXYtpDDPPhEa_ExUV8alaQ", "DP7ddvk4zqxdbYeHU2Qa0g", "YnAk0xF2CU2L_h3dHbOLmw", "kzDzdbPupHiglDzs9HD0vA", "7auAh3cNsTwnOabJzAbYOQ", "qBbTCei6_dW5-ss-7X9b5g", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "WvutaEoxM-8ME0JFTTWBDg", "6FV6lBJoBy-GFNuq6UBn7Q", "UC5GAmUpmN2wGgcaIw-n_Q", "EROldS0l04S1sXMLY9nNQg", "p7OZx3RIeJPxSM4hP6wqEA", "b4Ie47uteUB_nxJ4y02pvA", "H36aXcfIcrj7AYmF3haBOQ", "4lXwcTkAaoZoO17y9eOljQ", "_Eysff2hwHV6d6ps5jzoZw", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "SzGpNUbABLUXpCx0DUPrQA", "LEnrdsFTeAv6ftoU-R6QKQ", "iLjMdZi0Tm7DQxX1C1_2dg", "neuW2w4TWAj6nuuQoGyl8Q", "kXTQGh5y05t_HS3M6L9P0A", "hMmK5Iuv8jakXAnZZnKgJg", "uPoDB6rk11jqU9Kv6GBmsQ", "7sa-oJmXYrpDCehgRAiQAA", "FdceaylB02-jA6Gk1tMkQQ", "0i48XMffmTVqLkIdwxf6aQ", "soXQSviznSYj4KmVfDS3tg", "kPmqODzzkktOQ-VyFO35BA", "NfLiY0bAkR66dPC0YJz6eQ", "WNERBwv3oJXg_T5kpQ3t3Q", "WEFBNv2ktb7srEthw2YIWw", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "7zkTZXYZqI5UCVSVrIaZ5Q", "BTf5CVNQbizjhevXXfI1Vw", "8uMX_ghoeJHaeOOxaAPVJg", "qcXyDacgTrjdsGjQpv0yyg", "pi0cL1us0efzU338D9wORQ", "_eNWL08NTgjT-gKvgc79BQ", "tUW0AXg4C3H9TP5lyhoQuA", "AqR9SsmS6ehOnWV4-gO68Q", "xyad5PXaHTdKrdNClXbMqQ", "MPuHDtZ-2oH-DhDXCfyRPw", "ZOAJ6tt9hRhJNl-ICdgjBA", "2VmCalJg32_wOPMGu80kQQ", "bjpj60rqZFvlEjIULEupVw", "ydagNFLzr3Nhdwzzun1Dig", "OFiql6570Ts_rnq-OZQr2Q"], "elite": ["2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"], "average_stars": 3.73, "fans": 27}}

It had variety of breakfast  selections that other places at times do not offer.  \n\nWe ordered some food dishes and 1 hot chocolate, 1 coffee and 1 cortado, and we were served with avocado bowl first.  Then only 1 coffee arrived.  We sat for 15 minutes more as I did not get my coffee.  When I brought this up to my waiter, he became agitated and told us that there was problem in the kitchen, but what did it have to do with cortado? Not sure.  He wanted to comp for the inconvenience of cortado brought in  so late and stormed off when he was suggested that drinks should arrive together and before the food.  He them never came back to  check up on us.  All poached eggs were raw and undercooked, and my husband asked to replace it, but another waitress promised to replace it, but never did.  \n\nAs I walked to see if they had any baked goods, the same waitress started to show me directions to the bathroom, which I never asked.  She seemed tuned out and disconnected and then realized that she was talking to the wrong person when I looked at her in my dismay because I never asked her where the bathroom was.  This same waitress was also asked to bring butter, but she just ignored it or was just spaced out.  \n\nA side note, our waiter was also arguing with another customer and they were both agitated.  \n\nThe drip coffee was good, but the cortado had too much milk. \n\nThe staff seemed apathetic, dismissive, rude and overwhelmed.  When we asked the spaced out waitress if she was overwhelmed, she responded that she wasn't, yet she never brought our butter, our eggs, never acknowledged our feedback, did apologize, and we were never comped the coffee ad promised.\n\nSome suggestions to the owners:\nPlease train your staff on customer service and have more supervision on site.

The tall male behind the register, who is almost always behind the register, didn't acknowledge me at all.

He slams the cup of ice down, then he looks to me, somewhat exasperated and says, \"What can I get you?\" I say, \"Hi, I'd like a small iced coffee\", and I pull my credit card out to pay. He said the price so quickly and quietly that I didn't hear him and asked him to repeat. He said $3.78 as he was filling a cup with ice for my coffee. Now, I have to admit,  I was a little shocked at that amount, this place has the ambiance of a chain, so I said, \"Ohhh.. no, I don't want that anymore. What do you ha ---\" Before I finished my sentence, he had already thrown the ice back into the bin, and stormed off! Like he was upset that I didn't want to pay $4 for a cup of iced coffee... [as a former barista, I know nobody reeeally wants to pay $4 for a cup of iced coffee, and that's ok - it's not a reflection on you - got it, dude?] I stood there, with my mouth literally open, credit card in hand, expecting him to return - which he didn't. I couldn't believe he had walked away as I was trying to order something else! Suffice it to say, I'll go to PS&Co or even Starbucks (gasp!) if I need coffee in the future.

After my previous review in regards to the piccolo coffee, I decided to give the food a try. I asked for vegemite + avocado smash. I asked for extra cherry tomatoes on top. The nice guys over the counter told me it came with cherry tomatoes. Did not say anywhere in the menu (under the toast section). And I pointed to what I wanted on the menu, not sure how that could be misleading. They asked if I wanted feta, I said no. They asked if I wanted tahini, because it comes with it. I thought tahini, feta, avocado together? That goes my macro allowance! (Just joking). I was worried and overwhelmed that my humble vegemite and avocado has turned out to be this gigantic monster spread. I gave it a go. I didn't complain, I'm no chef, I'm sure they know what they are doing. I got back to the hotel and I was gobsmacked! I had a piece of toast that was half vegemite on one side of the bread and tahini on the other, topped with very unriped avocado. For vegemite eaters, we know that we don't smack a lump of vegemite on bread, it is served sparingly with some sort of fat; butter more commonly or avocado. I was frustrated that I got a blob of Vegemite on one side and tahini on the other, ( you (can see the division on that piece of toast), it became inedible (I'm sorry if that sounds rude). \n\nThe thing is that I came to Bluestone to have my regular brunch fix to feel at home. Although I was happy to go somewhere else to have brunch, but when a cafe claimed to serve Vegemite and piccolo I expect them to do it correctly, I don't think that's a lot to ask. My suggestion, take off piccolo and call it Cortado, I'll accept that. Makes everything easier. I have given this place lots of tries at different times of the day but they failed to deliver. \n\nFor the 6 weeks I've been in downtown Philly, I have been having Americano and Cortados like a local and I don't mind it as it comes out exactly how it's suppose to. \n\nBelieve me, I was rooting for Bluestone.

I did not remember being so disappointed after my first visit to this location a year ago. \n\nFood - do not be fooled by the pictures. The plating sure looks nice, but the portion is unbelievably tiny. Almost every single dish on the menu that is savory contains sheep milk's feta. As I don't eat sheep/goat dairy products, I requested to substitute the cheese to any thing else, but I was told that they do not have any other cheese and could only remove the cheese completely from the dish. I decided to ordered the green baked eggs without feta in the end. It was such a bad choice - without any cheese, the dish did not even have any flavor. There was two eggs that were cooked through, and some unseasoned spinach at the bottom. No flavor at all. \n\nCoffee - you would think the coffee here will taste good since it's a coffee shop after all. Latte for $3.5 is tiny. The coffee is mediocre and tastes bland. They do not offer free refill for regular coffee even if you're eating in. \n \nEnvironment - the place is actually a good study spot, although I did not find any outlets but it has WiFi. It's also very quiet, and almost empty on a Sunday afternoon. \n\nService - I might be already biased when the server told me that they could not substitute feta, but I was further surprised about the poor service during my meal. Right after my food is served and I started eating, the server came by to sweep the floor right next to me three times. I did not get a picture when she was right next to me, but the two pictures shows when she was sweeping nearby. On her fourth visit to my table, she asked me how my food was while holding the broomstick in her hand. \n\nAfter I finished the food, I left for another coffee shop to continue my work. I don't think there's any reason for me to come back.", "date": "2019-09-11 20:09:27", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "pa6glQGbGNFP-FZhITV0pQ", "name": "Mandy",

Banana bread was good, but $13? We were told by the cashier that it would be a \"loaf\", but it ended up being two very small pieces. \n\nThe cafe itself is also fairly dirty, and we had to end up switching tables as soon as we came in because the silverware tucked into the napkin on our table had a long black hair in it that wouldn't come out, no matter how hard the cashier tried to clean it up when she brought out my salad. \n\nI would definitely skip this place as it's overpriced and the uncleanliness really grosses a person out before they eat their meal.

The service model is horrendous. On the many times I have stopped in on my morning commute (between 7:30am-8:30am), the order of operations behind the coffee bar has been clunky and slow for those of us ordering coffee to-go. I deliberately choose cold brew, regular coffee, or a juice (vs. espresso drinks which take longer) when I'm in a hurry. The person who takes orders also fulfills simple coffee orders AND serves the sit-down area in the back. This means that when there are 1 or more people waiting at the cashier, they are waiting for more than 5 minutes to even put their coffee order in and pay. Then they wait another 10 minutes for their cold brew to appear on the other side of the counter! In addition, the cashier doesn't even acknowledge the people waiting in line with a \"I'll be right with you.\" The pace of the staff is almost slow motion. The last two times I tried getting a coffee here, I gave up without being able to place an order.\n\nThis may be an okay place to visit if you're staying at the hotel and have no immediate plans, but it's not worth wasting your time if you hope to get in and out in less than 15 minutes (which is crazy for something as simple as coffee).", "date": "2019-11-05 17:37:31", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "KtRN-Fp5M8HvEqL0PGb_rw", "name": "Abby", "review_count": 28, "yelping_since": "2014-01-12 04:33:48", "friends": ["AAa29moZRBKqqqtgcaOYRw", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "uY19qSEnqU3KA-hbj7Oveg", "oOW2k_fHn3pvogLlw62NzQ", "LMoK9BUP6Tgfc0AeDVbZHQ"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.21, "fans": 2}}

I heard of them when I was in NYC but I was happy to see that they had some cafes in Philly! I would say this location is weird because it's actually connected to a hotel so bathroom access requires hotel key cards (which are provided by Bluestone) and the wifi is directly from the hotel (the wifi works fine btw). Upon entering, I was asked if I was dining in. I requested that I just wanted coffee and carried on with ordering a small latte. The barista was going to put it in a paper cup, but I requested to have the coffee in a cup since I was actually going to sit here for a while. The first thing I noticed about their latte is that the cup sizing is really small compared to other places I've checked out. The latte was served in a Gibraltar like cup, but I personally thought the latte small. Maybe not worth the almost $4 I paid for a latte. Taste of the drink was fine though.\n\nAnyways, the seating around this spot is nice. There is bar seating around the center as well as individual tables along the walls. Plugs are limited, but I was able to snatch one along the wall seating area. The employees are definitely friendly although there was this one HELLLLA  sassy person working. I think their system of being a caf\u00e9/coffee caf\u00e9 is confusing. One can either participate in the typical dine in experience where one sits down with a menu and orders food with a server etc, the other option is just to order coffee in the front and grab a place to chill. \n\nTheir dine in menu looks IG worthy and appetizing, but their prices are ridiculous in my opinion. Their popular dish, the avocado smash, is $10...without any add ons. That's essentially $10 for just an avocado toast?! I might try Bluestone lane again, but this place definitely isn't the best place to get your bang for your buck.", "date": "2017-03-02 18:56:03", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "user":

I waited to be seated, waiter told me to feel free to sit anywhere. I sat at a small table since it was just me and was trying to be considerate of other larger parties that might come. \nThe waiter brought me a menu and after a few minutes asked me if I wanted anything to drink...yep. I wanted a latte. Then he just took away the menu before I could say anything else. \"Excuse me, in sorry, but could i get back the menu to have a look at your lunch options?\" I felt bad because he was clearly embarrassed. I eventually went with the avocado smash with prosciutto...I would say, skip the prosciutto, definitely not worth the extra $4 here. Although it was only one slice of bread with avocado on top, it was quite filling and the tomatoes were fresh and lovely. \n\nI am not sure what happened to the staff during my meal but it seemed like everyone disappeared except the cashier. No one came to check on me during my meal or after. No one came to ask if I needed anything else (I really did want some dessert). In the end I just got up, put my menu in a tray where I saw some others and went to cashier to pay for my meal. Maybe this is just how it is here, you're sort of left alone after they bring the food but I wasn't expecting it. So awkward. \n\nOtherwise, my latte was great and the vibe of this place is nice (the modern low pop music is a plus). Also, this place doesn't accept cash.", "date": "2017-08-30 17:17:06", "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "erBDslOZXDI48j5QB_I_SA", "name": "Sarita", "review_count": 249,

It has an amazing location, right on the corner of 17th and Locust. The decor inside is quite lovely with a beachy feeling. \n\nI stopped by last Sunday to grab something to drink. Once there, I realized that I wanted to try out something from their menu as well. I got the Aussie Baked Bean that came on a hot skillet. It looked very cute but it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked. For me it was flavorless ( no seasoning whatsoever!!). So it came with 2 organic poached eggs, baked beans, arugula and two slices of bread on the side. I have to say that bread was the only thing that tasted good. As a drink I got a matcha latte. This one was very yummy. They used almond milk for it. \n\nService - pretty much horrible. My boyfriend ordered a small coffee that apparently they forgot to bring it. I was already done with my latte when we asked the waitress what happened to the coffee order and apparently they had forgot. We went to order at the counter and no server came up to us at all throughout the whole time we sat. Another thing that I didn't like was the whole kitchen idea being in the middle of the cafe. After staying there for more than an hour, I smelled like burnt oil. It seemed as there wasn't any ventilation at all. Basically, this place left me with a \"meh\" feeling.", "date": "2016-02-12 17:41:59", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "4tqv48yYK6Jk5aZsncDC-g", "name": "Doina", "review_count": 180, "yelping_since": "2013-09-09 16:16:28", "friends": ["ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "UXLC_VVdfGr0JFzrEP-VxA", "vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA", "2t-4sq0PdXR0WZi5svyGBA", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "yIsQ4qFCyY-clmlRwQlw_w", "QRUCiW1LwtHiRDjorK3UHA", "oiB8fJMd96MNUugca5cvig", "6ngC8iXi-Wujg1v5Tqc1QA", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "VVmEOOszDAZ9iUGP8PyHag", "oHscS1rsyIV40TJSEY9n8g", "O309sD2Vq3b200i0Roru4Q", "qJFKlbq9qrpeO2DUR-kBDA", "x4omhfDEgpwWUwNzgAcqyg", "KLrTBLpN4csEWKdLX2meYQ", "SGPCLi-kVZ_pz1w7VJtkeA", "K7ke2iBVJJ8RtBj2IUE8Fw", "JeeuvpSpTE-iweiKwGiwFg", "sk9iNZoVO2mtDNXUfQNgeA", "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "mlTKzrwkscLRwVvUA9gWiw", "5Q0PHyZ7HyCrKw5xOXWvcw", "5osmCTQ14HUiOD9d6f7nUQ", "qmAvHDO5LUSW5NEiEXPZLA", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "j9ASEWvf-5vKwVxOCkjOwQ", "gIwpbT2MOjnRRysE0hEwkA", "ZTocvrJNFdVRz3NUToXaVQ", "zu-e06_BM_TdkAZEKMrIww", "C2nzoqU60AcRPHpCBsEScQ", "VEsC22Y5RAdJyWrSfcSoMA", "eVc8G_byevTk1pNKPBs7xg", "QqMeCZMhTFbvz7Em1Jfq5Q", "-iBDGU-3XRRdX4mrxA-sGA", "HxyLRaoH9PS09M6R3rV-EQ", "NkJanQKNtthmpBZsAtEx5w", "mTTzstv---q1tld8KIQ_pg", "xDVd1YGZ3KN0JAJE1y__BQ", "qxwO5hNDn5hphHDUnTdryw", "OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg", "c5FJQY7xzduyvyd0sSawBg", "TUwDVyY9bGqFZxVw0UqMNQ", "8MrHNUT0QBpD5vHxn1rD2w", "Zp5TSI0LAQZfUk1ZZn2Dkw", "cBhZADyDjhpU1NQiDGi2Mg", "orQdiPYw-FL5dyoWmYx6KQ", "JOK7lfhftHn4mQTHiLexNw", "apF1GenqGrX4h9jrje6VrQ", "gXpVmuIiaVJrskxQ0eDj3Q", "RjdEJpAm_CfGYaouFziuWQ", "dyAaNxc4QGNxOIYz5uSy4g", "sGaoPWB_p1aOm5z9cnV3Aw", "dyPYbBf0yAMpgpJHB-E9VA", "MQMnEAoku97P6GSigNr3xQ", "MKDVsEzQK48og5S0MItoyg", "UKSw9kfoBfdatSMUl-jGnA", "00IMglj7Z6ZGPbZHngp8oA", "awY1r6K5YVaD2v5cGV5E3Q", "gzQaaoPzzQi83QMS7XdrKg", "_Snvv_nGfpctBG4OOWwGLg", "YCkwKUOu6bVKJkqjeT4BrA", "T4krZTIaiNgOFBoP_1fRJw", "CLusZcnFCBMAh5W-7EezTw", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "cndpW4OQV2tXy9Ek61u7hQ", "Lrlwf3j26el7woSwYqIoIQ", "N9hqTPQu2bmI8c2Pj8F1ww", "61FNJUiDqXReViksOYiILQ", "R3h9RootEfP94fZPCjcwzA", "UvGG9UC29GBYhfa6A113Xw", "ynO2E2xuey8iT_q8y-Dy8Q", "ryisT19-tzvMyVVi0iLvwA", "gsMmv6eL1hDp-oFvedK5Fg", "NGGhrejh6lnUzqqyhG40Qg", "slpyLHWsvPXwj1XPoyjugQ", "1bjo-xG3tKF5rQjRx5zW4Q", "lo2tGpH4-tosiLlsY1uukg", "-mTKdP_ctxOTvYU68N3YFA", "jL1TI1E0Yc0y-yQKCh307A", "XdXgIs4i5JFvtJf0rJlWsA", "fvsMP37QbtqcjSkXJF-TvA", "wZWB41wmnv4pPsetuIN5Gw", "DSG2QzgGD_0QgNGqYITraw", "GhuMzO3JVds90tweXV5t7A", "Y_2jMUKz6pvJ0JSWG3u10A", "dG-21DZ474K5NqCe0nHP7A"], "elite": ["2015", "2016", "2017", "2018"], "average_stars": 4.08, "fans": 11}}

I wanted to like this place because the location is great, space is cute, and provides a great healthy brunch option. However, the food is simply underwhelming. \n\nOrdered a rainbow bowl which consisted of a colorful arrangement of veggies (spinach, corn, avocado, quinoa, etc) and a side of yogurt tahini as well as a chicken sandwich. The rainbow bowl was filling because of the quinoa and avocado, but definitely lack flavor and certain items seemed to be an afterthought. For example, there were 2 pieces of feta cheese in the whole dish - not enough to actually give it any flavor profile, but still there. The chicken sandwich was probably the greatest disappointment as it was extremely bland in flavor. It was lacking some citrus to make the flavors stand out. \n\nI also ordered the matcha latte which was also lacking in match flavor and had chunks of powder towards the bottom. And it came at a hefty cost of $5.40. \n\nIf you want a healthy option and are okay with spending a little more, it's not a bad option to try.

I love the colors here, as they are straight out of my dream kitchen/dining space.  Something about light green and gray and white gives a space a sense of being calming and clean.\n\nOnto the food:  This time I ordered the breakfast bowl.  It included cherry tomatoes, feta, avocado, sauteed kale, a poached egg and red quinoa.  I was impressed with the portion size, as I wasn't able to finish it - a big deal for a plate cleaner like me!  \n\nI thought this meal had a lot of good qualities and just a few areas of improvement.  All of these ingredients went very well together, so that you could take a bite of any two or three of them and it was a solid mix of flavors.  (It's a deconstructed bowl, so it's up to the diner to either mix it all together or to assemble individual bites throughout the meal.)  \n\nI will say that without the feta, there was no salt/seasoning in the dish, so each bite did need that component in order to taste complete.  The poached egg was also overcooked, but I'm not as deeply in love with runny eggs as everyone else seems to be, so it was alright with me.\n\nLastly, the staff and owner stay on top of quality improvement and I really do appreciate that.  There was no defensiveness, just genuine open-mindedness and accommodation.  That unique quality plus the healthiest breakfast I've had in quite awhile made me a happy diner today.", "date": "2018-02-13 16:34:37", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "MfAo-QPgFrcziuygx27K5w", "name": "Carissa", "review_count": 375, "yelping_since": "2010-06-16 20:43:11", "friends": ["x_bV9ooRseUcyj55vYcYFg", "SkpFuZvgBp_91nqCqaXfIw", "ynHu1SeYneE6ERI4xxhJmg", "HJdFNtGwRUpDI6KvorA4cw", "2rh1vkYhnW2OfbTHlReFRA", "IkbZ44mhqUqONmkBAsK-ZQ", "JNOQJ9GH9g45NzkKEq9Ybg", "eyoznq-sk9mmFrj5jqrARQ", "USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA", "XgbKFLI9cMzHts6C89Myng", "dnCE0O3DvsmxBysa-TdYRA", "Hg5J-w6M0aSVPh9duetNmg", "q3RK8zKIgjOIt6wVMCIK-g", "5Uvm5z0tzmjz4weYcYngKw", "q--HEkJmUBT5Nvu0EvWzpw", "habMIEbSd1oTMUGSAy3aOQ", "kaa6i7IHMyYIom7DIul9EQ", "PrvC_O_UqgyoV5m3E_bpyA", "zC-DhSRteQ1aXGLlVewRTA", "CyRMrRc2VP__X0R_KO4z_g", "UZSDGTDpycDzrlfUlyw2dQ", "NJVuvaqS6pBzksY6U7TzYw", "hMgWWOCaccWqxjPHjjO18w", "x7u1pveICoOMn6osdojIOw", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "FxuDifObogmez8ov_E-EBA", "CM2ttovi_tnFIZBiCaiKiQ", "KqJrGzkkyxB4z0hvqm0Tiw", "o_Ijl1T8p6PpsUwGXjprXQ", "U1ohzJyqZ-CoezAZCkyqig", "EO1Cz15wYnHQ0aGc9T6tzw", "UMHC0kzV6TS8O6HLb5mpYw", "yLW8OrR8Ns4X1oXJmkKYgg", "MLBDBCvCyMlTjo_Ux_K9Ew", "AxfLs-3fwGyBM0KJd7ttdA", "135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A", "t8PN1mFxF-FHQc9cNfmWBQ", "CgOh5rZluMnl2KMPvzktug", "oAqxn3FoGsz_rKve60iU5w", "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "V7vDvgrcFDyA5zGzK1tGsA", "W-1meIrhOxzAWgtAApDgGw", "AWCBPEbG_zO3n3kq9RXyPw", "jRgxiEZiFxmmLn5QaoRWNA", "kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA", "j1xCt-I1MDwtV3Ubw-EZhA", "B9iPTih0dmpZn6fRyZnLLg", "8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw", "GIS9eSaabFd6RYSSNqrhog", "BhJiocdYVZ5Kbs6Y6jBRqw", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "l4ozFMke_axL7S6L3q05Sw", "Kw3YKDznw24hphgO1HPtHA", "sr-VYtoayw20Fg2qHDUu5w", "QU9kL7dJtZ8yhwKlcZlyJA", "wndfy33xbaKElWA5n6_JxQ", "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "8lEywHSvti2UjFP8ODbnHg", "aOJM_jpPzJO4yjWtbfOkEA", "pyK1NsV_aSeXY-j1vSzqvQ", "NFEcnI4evuzIxKYw_GDPXA", "sppG3hwAzwwutTy6vcp4Rw", "nVSWhxT4FKDV4krM6i3sNw", "eAYyPwGQ-Am-sOvCHI8Hqw", "9LdfM33NJKrQnMikpZ6lug", "NwVyki35xOcaxhMzHNtHDQ", "BnpIirxUGueHptNUF7YwxA", "ckAqkP1HGRVjFZs5NURQwQ", "pxyMwMptwW9uvSD7LeJiTQ", "CD6vblUhvFCsskTS3_TUTw", "KaTNs-l7wthLI4t0jSULqQ", "RPK_GZ8qgI3Q1XrreMit2A", "UEs8A-LV1mplEXYmuYKHRw", "AIYdAajIPezTm1v_smYTlA", "2lkOwXLJZRIIzji4Gwui6A", "qqcGSHjhajLWrUtpL-ScOQ", "OVFrVpquq80RHdlxkRRK4g", "MrtYqNzYzEewIQVSFAplnQ", "MWWqoUjm61WLlCwnkRIIRQ", "Bosut8hrdyPT2GNC14aqMg", "4lXwcTkAaoZoO17y9eOljQ", "2qqUJSBq8TSMPgSIBOt1FA", "g1Na2Xs4haT5IYk4e_dS4Q", "5Z5Pq5tMKzbXjATgXsKFFQ", "AorBIM1K0nzuCRjz2DBvAA", "o4nJuh3eKrEJkZGtt_oUfw", "co-g07lL_AMxF2fC8OeCdA", "lhChghTp1n_sw8bspkIsBg", "ZFR1aPaMDgWbzsBkVEHxQA", "xEd3_h7N3hwuBb9vYTCupg", "wGdGHzZil8OGtzB2RL4gFw", "1gTlz8QAI-F4QBZjjtJTiA", "dx9bCFqO5yATFOBoXlvevQ", "QHsDHqN_FJY0OdDzYI0LzA", "zpwWpno3U-oZaG3AJuKqSQ", "x6FBZjnRe0mwibshxyUd2w", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "hwdakJQVoCZKUSH3JkpfQA", "yKis4vn4DOl8Owr8b0FSFA", "gzQaaoPzzQi83QMS7XdrKg", "6gpFSRdHvgBBjJydotZCjg", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "vTTd3ZT34-7pkxpW1zmVIw", "b_hOVL43ocK8Shn91hdlHQ", "ru_LlJIG3WZyO7ULVRi_kA", "QOIqH25Cp31Z8D9sQmGZUw", "ysCYxhFVEg0vRwqozpOsaw", "NIvJg811OO-ovOOg_2udAw", "GfI-d9mQePFA2PvhAd4WGQ", "5_PECeu_6UUdH_ghKJfrrw", "V2u9UDVXmzi-wDzRC9T4Ww", "J_9u4wBB62lRLjJDg3OFvA", "aYa5DvAzmOfdUOHJLiWAYg", "b2FXdRqCAfMlPhUtlt9DwQ", "STO9KprPS0pZVO75VX_bvA", "6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q", "SXxO9vVjd4_u-khNpPUMYg"], "elite": ["2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.56, "fans": 17}}

I paid over $4.50 for a large hot tea, and that is too steep, pun intended.  I think for that price, I'll stick with my Starbucks tea for about $3, and at other cafes, I am never given a hard time about double cupping or a beverage sleeve, like I often am here.  For $4.50, I would appreciate more friendly service.  \n\nAgain, I really do like the idea of this cafe, it seems nice and cute, and I would like to go there, relax, read a book, but I hardly ever feel that it's inviting or warm.  \n\nI feel that yesterday a situation left me upset.  I knew what I wanted to order, and I kept waiting to order, the people ahead of me couldn't decide and kept thinking about what they wanted.  I was in a hurry to an appointment and I finally said, \"I know what I want, I'm ready to order\"- the manager said \"well there's a line\" and I feel like by keeping me waiting, that could have been handled better, if someone else took my order, but alas, the service was slow again...\n\nI hope that they can hire more people and that they can have a better, more efficient customer service experience.

Located inside the Warwick Rittenhouse Hotel, the cafe is spacious with indoor and outdoor seating available. I love the clean, minimalist aesthetic of the cafe. Every table has a QR code that pulls up their menu and ordering site so you can order and pay directly on your phone. The menu is health focused with a lot of nutritiously balanced dishes full of greens, proteins, and carbs. Although their food menu is not large, everything looks really good and in reality the food also taste good. Definitely one of the few foods healthy foods that I've had that also taste good Their drinks menu on the other hand is quite extensive and similarly, they all look good too. Price wise, everything was very reasonable. \n\n*BREAKFAST*\nBeet latte - the name says it all. It  was my first time trying a beet drink of any sorts and you can definitely taste the beets in this. It taste pretty good.\n\nGreen baked eggs - Shakshuka-style baked eggs dished. Although it came out in a relatively small cast iron, this dish was filling. The chimichurri made the dish quite flavorful, not bland at all. I love the runny over easy style eggs. Solid mix of greens, proteins and carbs. \n\n*VERDICT*\nI would definitely come back again.

Went in after a night of *maybe* too much drinking, and the breakfast sandwiches and ricotta toast were exactly what we needed. Absolutely no complaints about the food.\n\nOur waiter was super nice, and we had a kind of funny interaction. I was feeling a little, let's say, queasy from the previous night's drinking and inquired as to whether they had ginger ale. He said, \"We don't carry soda, we prefer to stick to the healthier side here.\" My husband proceeds to order a coffee off the menu that is literally just coffee with two scoops of ice cream in it. Unfortunately the ice cream was actually out, so my husband had to miss out on this healthy treat. :)\n\nI personally didn't really like the iced coffee we both ended up having, but again the food was great. Service was good too, pretty quick even though the place started filling up after we sat down.\n\nIt's also a little pricey for what it is, but that's true of a lot of the places we checked out in this area.\n\nOverall I recommend it(especially if you're staying at the attached hotel, can't beat the convenience), but if you want something with better coffee and a larger selection and have a little extra time, I might suggest walking over to Plenty Cafe instead.", "date": "2018-08-26 16:18:45", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "cWp5SI50JZsVfllfCAj18A", "name": "Cari", "review_count": 152, "yelping_since": "2013-05-07 14:22:03", "friends": ["ukArMfItJ7_YSo-N_umteQ", "pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew", "hm6Qh7w8ieCWV28a3bLRyg", "VL12EhEdT4OWqGq0nIqkzw", "O67_GwXOecWY5Qoor6VFdQ", "doFhBZMCQAzshdb94hv7rw", "rEmdoDvnFb32f_7CaFKAoA", "sraTrYU-7q_bQ0TxQrLJvQ", "1kkjNaZlRUYxp4evgtuJGw", "Bw7S12p7KWjvgO9lz99s7Q", "CPjN-lDb_qht4AfJ1l2vrw", "nhXyjGOCfi-EW09bJqfAzQ", "6FFENd2SiAGg767SXPkowQ", "eWolUZ0AVYOXcRgr_1YR7A", "XgrnrIMxmoemhXUjghH-mQ", "t6hWIBaIfA__NpxfGV0FVQ", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "tuoDDqTDCB-lDgelvMrp5Q", "HdvAosQHAHACOWnmpB6UBw", "g5nBwjYjOE6GEoh09s2ovA", "J7aS4HiOHjLWJZ6FiAFeTQ", "l4ozFMke_axL7S6L3q05Sw", "8lEywHSvti2UjFP8ODbnHg", "6jjHo9Lilv3kTy87pm2ycw", "NFEcnI4evuzIxKYw_GDPXA", "P5hp_o83R5Uzey4xkpCmRw", "m6ePktu2cDs1auXdoIzt5w", "RozW31TWJMSsBPjnzOZgbA", "SKwMaFXP4Umiihb7bd4xlg", "_NodMaAMXMbRhoyH_y15Ig", "cHYdKbJzmWXLupvur1STMg", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "yBpajT9TpzIpLtINu3Xl0w", "Nw7lc7IQJVeXUrO5d6ceoA", "VMLDVK6ANh-CnDxQNIAEEw", "1JlOo8MoX4e67l34aRulrg", "sg4RohBhIrgyzYUgH42_uw", "gsMmv6eL1hDp-oFvedK5Fg"], "elite": ["2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.77, "fans": 11}}

It's at a great location on an intersection of South 17th and Locust Streets with the street entrance on 17th. It is bright, well lit, clean and neat with a nice modern interior.  It was not too crowded or noisy when I was there on a Saturday morning for breakfast -- which was 9-10 a.m. The breakfast food is creative and very good. At least it is my idea of a good breakfast that is not merely the standard eggs and bacon or pancakes and waffles. The wait staff are courteous and professional. \n\nIt is a restaurant, not just a caf\u00e9, so is not yet another Center City caf\u00e9 where you order coffee, pastries or a breakfast wrap from a limited menu at the counter and then find a bar stool or a catch-as-catch-can seat at a table. Though it has bar seating along a wall, it primarily seats customers at a number of individual two- and four-person tables where you are waited upon -- exactly what I was looking for to meet a friend for Saturday morning breakfast. \n\nMy only minor criticisms are that the boutique juices are pretty pricey (at around $10 for a glass), so I personally gave those a pass, and the decanters they serve the hot coffee in are literally too hot to touch. They look like little glass milk jars. My dining companion and I actually had to use our napkins to pour our coffees, so they need to find other coffee decanters to serve coffee. (Hint to the management: The waitstaff should offer to decant the first serving of coffee when it's brought to the table, in any case -- at least I think that would be more in line with the setting and level of service you are trying to offer.) However, I certainly won't detract any stars for these minor issues.\n\nThough the juices are pricey, the meals are very reasonable. My dining companion and I had breakfast and coffee for under $20 each, including tax and a 20% tip, which is a great value for a Center City breakfast spot that is this nice. \n\nThis restaurant connects directly to the Warwick Hotel building which provides an interior entrance to the restaurant, so exiting the restaurant down that hallway leads to the restrooms, which are equally tasteful and very clean, always a telling attribute of any establishment. \n\nI hope the management and staff keep up the good work because, at least as of the date of this review, if you're wanting a nice place for breakfast or brunch I definitely recommend Bluestone Lane. It's definitely a great contribution to the Center City morning eateries.", "date": "2018-12-01 17:08:01", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "SJVgz5Qm5GasGwYjQu00jA", "name": "D", "review_count": 25, "yelping_since": "2010-06-18 21:50:34", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.41, "fans": 2}}

With everything we already have in Philly, you'd think it would be difficult to open up a unique cafe here where you can order things you can't get anywhere else...but that's exactly what this place has done. Bluestone Lane is extremely popular in NYC and has perfected the super trendy, \"did you really eat it if you didn't Instagram it\" avocado toast. \n\nYou may think, \"Really...$12 for a piece of toast with avocado on it? Gimme a break.\" But it is so much more than just that. The toast is multigrain and really tasty and then slathered with the most delicious tahini (which is a sesame seed paste). Then, it is piled high with \"avocado smash\" which is Bluestone Lane's special avocado mixture. YUM it is SO GOOD. It also has sunflower sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, and feta cheese. All very fresh and complements the avocado very nicely. You can also add a poached egg for $2 if you wish. \n\nThe ambiance of this little cafe is so cute and it's kind of separated from the front where you can walk in and order coffee and the back of the cafe where you can sit and order with table service. Also, bonus points because it's nicely decorated with teal and white pillows on the seats for your back.\n\nI ordered the avocado smash (obviously) and a flat white. The flat white was exactly what I expected. It was piping hot with a nice design and had a kind of sweet, acidic taste which I liked. From the time I sat down to the time I got my food it was probably about 6 minutes. They only had one waiter and I sat in the corner so I just got his attention and my food came in no time at all. It didn't seem like anyone around me waited more than 10 minutes for their orders. I know a lot of other reviews on here commented about the wait but keep in mind, this cafe is brand-new and it seems like they've fixed the wait time problem already. Pretty great, if you'd ask me. \n\nAll in all, I gave 5/5 stars for the cute ambiance, amazing avocado toast, yummy coffee, great customer service, and that there was hardly any wait time at all.

Full disclosure, it was a lovely day outside, I was in no hurry, and I was happy to be meeting a friend to explore something new. So, I came with no expectations, plenty of time, and a generally positive mood. We sat for table service and got a menu with a pretty good selection of drinks on one side and food options on the other.\n\nIt was a bright, airy spot. Our servers were friendly and happy to answer questions. Yes, it's no cash, which they tell you in advance. It felt to me like the kind of place that takes its time and care with their food and drinks - it took longer than I'm used to, but I enjoyed the time to be present and mindful instead of rushing through it. I was facing the wall, so I don't have a sense of how busy or not it was.\n\nThe golden (turmeric) latte was amazing. Warm, spicy, a little sweetness, and a gorgeous golden color. I'm not a coffee drinker, so their other latte options (including matcha, beet, etc.) were super attractive to me. Plus I like the idea that they've got some fun healthy ingredient to add some pizzazz to my day. At first the size does seem small, but it was actually the perfect amount. Probably the best latte drink I've ever had. I assume, though, that you do have to like turmeric and that kind of savory spice =). Can't wait to try the matcha version next time.\n\nMy friend had the oats and yogurt. She raved about the lemon curd and asked for more. I had toast with avocado and vegemite. I've never met bread and avocado I didn't like, but I will say this toast was perfect - the type of thick, hearty toast that makes you happy you have bread in your life. And, a super significant portion of avocado. Vegemite was unexpected, but added a unique salty taste that paired well with the avocado (you only need a little!). Plus I got some good vitamin B! I only wanted a half portion (they give you two really big pieces of toast and - again- a ton of avocado), so I got a box for round 2 later today. \n\nLooking forward to coming back for another treat in the future.", "date": "2017-03-08 17:39:22", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "pl_6pRWdV2ht5IjJ_YEsPQ", "name": "Tara", "review_count": 13, "yelping_since": "2011-02-03 01:18:47", "friends": ["bryyAtjZQFRF6gRP8fSyCQ", "yd-PRvnG9tXxJDFo9Ohpvg"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.43, "fans": 0}}

I live in Center City and have for years. I'm a half-block away from this location and pop in 7-10 times a week. If you remember the place that was here before, The Coffee Bar, then you would know that this place is an upgrade. \n\nFirst, let's talk about how it is one of the very few places you can get quality Matcha tea in the area. For a big city like Philly, this is kinda sad. Also, the menu isn't built for people who want to sit down and eat 3 plates of bacon. Little Pete's, which is also amazing, is across the street for that. This menu has quinoa, avocado toast, eggs, granola, etc. They have a ton of gluten-free options as well. The coffee menu has flat whites, black and whites, long blacks, piccolos, etc. It is just very different than what is in Philly right now. And I think that is a good thing.\n\nThe ambiance is much better than before, too. The place is bright white and well-lit. When it first opened of course there were kinks to be worked out. That is everywhere. Federal Donuts, Double Knot, and other spots I've been to have all had hiccups when they started. For me, it was them running out of things I wanted to order. Since then it hasn't happened, and I'm guessing because they nailed down their sales. \n\nLastly, I have seen some complaining about price. And that's what compelled me to write this review. I assume that if you can leave a Yelp review, then you can look up prices online. Or better yet, on the menu when you're in the store. If you don't want to pay for organic avocado on gluten-free toast with an organic egg then don't do it. Again, you're paying for organic and gluten-free. It's not cheap anywhere. \n\nI think it's fitting that Bluestone Lane is situated between Parc and Little Pete's. Not cheap delicious diner food and not overly expensive French cuisine. Something in the middle. For those of us who live in the neighborhood, this option is not only welcome but much-needed.", "date": "2016-04-11 19:35:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "WCiRV0zpH1PGDI8nfPIYWA", "name": "Joseph", "review_count": 23, "yelping_since": "2013-02-23 18:16:43", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.3, "fans": 0}}

Summary: Wait for table was double as advised, waited for food for over 45 minutes after ordering, food was below average - cold, stale bread, poor taste, when feedback was given about the service/wait time the staff was unreceptive and dismissive. \n\nWas in for brunch Sunday 2/21/16 at 11:15am - table of 4.  We were told 15 minute wait (even called ahead and was told the same - it's why we chose to eat here); we waited over 30 minutes to get seated.  The hostess was pleasant, but it was obvious she was not managing seatings/wait times appropriately. \n\nOnce seated, we were informed of 5+ things on the menu of which the kitchen was 'out', and could not be ordered - for ex. home fries and chai tea.  As a breakfast place, I was particularly surprised about the home fries.  \n\nWe ordered as soon as we sat given we had ample time to look at the menu while waiting for a table. The server, Diana, was very pleasant.  She repeatedly had to deal with disgruntled patrons (after waiting longer than originally informed), informing them of a lack of items remaining on the menu, and watching as tables got up and left after an unacceptable amount of time waiting for their food.  We waited for over 45 minutes before receiving our food during which time multiple tables got up and walked out.  We only observed 7 plates of food being served during the 45+ minutes we waited for food.  We also observed a woman be seated and no one approached the table or requested her drink over for over 15 minutes; she also left after waiting without service. \n\nWe were approached a few times while waiting for our food to refresh beverages, one of the times we were informed the kitchen is small, they do no 'prep' work prior to cooking orders as they are received, and the food would be 'worth it'. We would have left, but with so much time invested, thought many times our wait couldn't be much longer - had we known it would be over 45 minutes for food, we would have left. \n\nThe food arrived and it was cold.  I don't even understand how this is possible give everyone was staring at the food window in hunger.  I ordered a mushroom benedict (think it's called mushroom toast there), and the 'homemade English Muffins' were stale.  The others in my party had pork toast, salmon sandwich (I think), and French toast.  I also tried the French toast which was tasteless...it was like eating chewy bread; no egg or spice flavor.  It was bad. \n\nAfter informing of the poor food, we got an 'I'm so sorry' and the plates were taken away. \n\nAfter the meal, we were offered 10% discount for our wait.  The restaurant also gives 10% off to students, so it wasn't much of a 'deal' given a student ID would have gotten us the same discount.  \n\nAt no time during our experience was there a sign of anyone assisting the kitchen or urgency to try and get customers served.  We recognize things go wrong, but when none of the employees seem to care about the inconvenience and lack of service to the customers, it's disappointing, at the least. \n\nOur party provided feedback after the meal.  3 out of 4 of us have extensive experience in restaurant service.  We explained the wait, asked why there was never any sense of urgency on behalf of the wait staff, poor food quality...  The response we received was 'we're a small kitchen'.  That's it.  They had nothing further.  It was apparent the staff (and I presume management) has no regard for the needs or expectations of customers.  \n\nWorst dining experience I've ever had.  I would have felt horrible leaving the table without eating, but every table had every right to go.  Everything was unacceptable.", "date": "2016-02-24 16:43:46", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "3mZY85D8z3HLmdSCrTm-Ig", "name": "Annie", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2014-11-04 01:35:22", "friends": ["4fJInXhWalo5mdmcFIXR6Q"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 0}}

I should actually kick myself because I read the reviews and I still attempted to come here! I blame it on my avocado toast craving (which I never even got). \n\nMy friend and I went in to get some quick breakfast and coffee after a work out class. We were debating whether to eat here but the menu looked promising and we decided to give it a try. We walked in and my friend placed her order of avocado toast and a cappuccino. I was still debating what to order. About two minutes after she paid, the guy at the register said that the chef has to \"step out\" and the kitchen is closed. No explanation other than that. I watched the chef who was casually dressed like he should be in bed calmly walk out the door. Now of course I would completely understand if there was a family or personal emergency, but that wasn't even explained to us. Also, why is there only one person in the whole place that can poach an egg and put avocado on a piece of bread? That just seems like poor planning and probably why most of the other reviewers had bad experiences with wait times. \n\nThe guy at the register then asked my friend if she wanted a refund on her coffee too, as if he thought we were going to sit there and give them business after we were told we couldn't order food. Once she said yes, he then attempted to give her a refund, got extremely flustered because the iPad/printer system wasn't working, and said he couldn't give her a receipt to show that she was actually refunded. The whole thing was just absurd! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here. I expect they won't stay open that much longer anyway.", "date": "2017-05-10 18:06:59", "useful": 9, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "bEGLhmfZB3wgVZcn9Aswwg", "name": "Jessica",

The very first time I went I had delicious food- oatmeal with fruit, tea, and a breakfast sandwich bagel. It was all awesome and the service was good, and the place is pretty cute. That is the reason for the 1 star. However the next 2 times I visited were absolutely horrible. Both times we were served by the same teen girl is clearly clueless when it comes to service. She expected us to order immediately, and when we asked for a little time to decide, it took her over 15min to return. Not to mention that she was NEVER around when we needed a refill, condiment, etc. I had to get up and get my own things.\n\nThey were out of the things we wanted both times- the second time they were out of oatmeal, avocado, bacon, English muffins. literally everything I would want. I don't understand why they were even open if they were out of so many ingredients! I literally had to order a piece of dry toast. My boyfriend got a dry toast with an egg- the egg was extremely rubbery and dry and totally unseasoned. To top it off, the tea I was served was cold and they were out of cream to put in my boyfriend's coffee. It was laughable. \n\nHowever, the absolute worst thing about this place is you leave smelling strongly like burnt toast EVERY time. It's disgusting. How they are managing to burn the very thing that their restaurant is named after is beyond me. Needless to say I won't be returning.", "date": "2015-05-27 20:19:01", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "oBsUC_qSa07OvT6nPxdiiw", "name": "Michelle", "review_count": 26,

I usually go here if I want something a step up from Starbucks but not as expensive as the nicer places near by. My food is certainly tasty but the service is dismal. The expensive coffee is nothing special.\n\nMy last experience two days ago is what prompted the review....\n\nOn a moderately busy Sunday (nothing unmanageable), my family and I entered looking for a bite. From past experience I knew that during the week you can seat yourself but on the weekend they prefer to seat you. I stood there awkwardly for almost 5 min waiting to be seated with all the waitresses buzzing about without being approached. When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could sit down she said a waitress would help me...that never happened. Meanwhile a table of 4 had been open this whole time so I helped myself to it (there was no one waiting and there were many vacant seats inside) It was un-bused so I had to take care of that as well. I also had to go get my own menus for my family since we were left on our own for 15 min.\n\nOur orders were finally taken. When I requested my eggs be scrambled for my egg sandwich (which I had done during a Wed there a week prior) I was told they could not since the cook will only make fried and poached gags that day. Nothing else. Seriously?\n\nMeanwhile the special of the day is a steak & egg breakfast burrito, in which clearly the eggs are scrambled.....so I decided to order that instead. But I requested no cheese given a personal intolerance. The waitress clearly took note of this since she asked if it was all dairy or not. However, my burrito came back filled with cheese.\n\nAfter sending it back, a new waitress came over and told me it would be 15 min to get my fixed order. Really? For the special of the day? Which no one else was even ordering in the restaurant so there should have been plenty. Almost a dozen people got their food served to them before my new order came out, so clearly the chef had no urge to fix his previous mistake and give me an expedited order....like every other restaurant on earth does.\n\nIt definitely took 15 min. Tasted good, nothing special. Especially with the residual bitterness I was experiencing give that my entire family had finished eating by the time I was served.\n\nI don't think I will be heading back here any time soon. Go to Mixto around the corner on Pine or to Green Eggs on 13th.

The two girls behind the counter offered no sort of direction and offered no sort of assistance, as we stood there confused on wether we order at the counter and sit or sit and wait to be waited on. \n\nWe decided to help ourselves to a couple of menus and sit down at a table to decide. Got up when we were ready and ordered at the counter and paid. I left my card on the iPad used for payment, as I was not sure if anything further was needed to complete the payment transaction. One of the girls proceeded to say \"Here is your card\" and toss it in front of me on the counter.  I would've appreciated my card to be handed to me instead. I was given my cappuccino at the counter, which I took myself to my table.  Our juice and iced coffee were brought over.\n\nI ordered the sausage egg toast, which was really good. My wife ordered the omelette of the day and chose ham and mushrooms. The omelette was overdone and dry. The mushrooms and ham were left whole in the omelette. She would've preferred for them to be chopped or sliced and folded in the omelette. \n\nI ordered another cappuccino, which I asked if possible to bring to the table and if I may take care of payment for later. Again, not clear to me what the norm in ordering and paying is at this establishment. \n\nNOW THE REASON FOR MY 2 STARS:\n\nWe already had the awkward first walk in impression, the tossed card and the whole mushroom caps and ham in the dry omelette. \n\nAs my second cappuccino is being brought to the table the girl bringing it tells the girl who made it, who seems to be new at making them, \"Don't worry you'll learn. He won't know the difference anyway.\" I was brought a sloppy looking cappuccino. But why would you say that in ear shot of the customer. We were siting at the table right next to the counter. I don't even want to assume the reason or criteria as to why she would assume that I would not know the difference. \n\nAll in all. Good cappuccinos, good Eggs Benedict, but horrible service wether voluntary or due to lack of training.

I loved the quirky staff and was friendly with most of them.\n\nA year later, this place is just plain TERRIBLE. Apparently it's now trying to pass as a coffee shop and BYOB/restaurant. I can tell you that this plan is failing miserably and I am frankly embarrassed on their behalf. The staff has completely turned over and the few times I've been there these past few months, I have been treated rudely, made to wait an unreasonable amount of time for simple orders, and told I can't order certain things from the menu because they're either out (it was just almond butter...how can you be out of almond butter?!) / \"it isn't dinner time yet\" (why did you give me a dinner menu then?!). In addition, this place does not have consistent hours - online it says it is open until 6 or 7, depending on the day. I have been kicked out as early as 4-4:30 on random days because they were closing. I've also definitely seen it open for dinner at times. Unpredictable/inconsistent hours - unacceptable.\n\nTo be fair, the food there is pretty good, just as good as it used to be - that's the only reason I'm giving this a 2/5 star rating instead of 1/5. But it's nothing exceptional/special and definitely not worth an over 30 min wait even when the restaurant has barely any people. And that's assuming you can even get your desired order, since they run out of ingredients so often. There are better coffee shops/cafes in the area with better staff, better drink selections, and better food. I'm sad to say this place is a complete miss (coming from a former regular), and I'd AVOID AT ALL COSTS.", "date": "2016-09-13 02:29:09", "useful": 6, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id":

It's quaint and cozy, and it was a perfect place to hop on a call while on my layover in Philadelphia. I figured I'd get a latte and some food while there. The latte was upwards of $4 for a small. I also ordered a turkey sausage grilled cheese, which I believe was around $10. We sat down and availed ourselves to the free wifi (great perk) while waiting for our food, which came within 15 mins. I took a bite of my crunchy grilled cheese, which was basically the size of a wonder bread slice, and was immediately horrified. This is not a grilled cheese with turkey sausage; this is a fucking abomination. I spread the sandwich and there was ONE slice of cheese on it--it was so dry that it wasn't even gooey or sticky. Also, there was ONE turkey sausage link that was sliced in half and spread diagonally across the sandwich. I would say that approximately 70% of the sandwich was turkey-less. The server happened to be nearby so my boyfriend said something about how the grilled cheese had no cheese...and he happily took it back and made a new one, with more cheese and the same amount of turkey sausage. It was a nice gesture but honestly, it's highway robbery to serve that sandwich and charge $10 for it. At the very most that sandwich costs $2 to make...and I'm including the side of salad greens. \n\nOverall, toast needs to step up their game. A little less stingy with the cheese, Some small tweaks to the menu, and slightly more reasonable prices, and the place would be great.", "date": "2014-11-26 17:54:54", "useful": 4, "funny": 4,

The space is decent, its not too loud of overrun like other coffee shops in the area, and the staff is extremely nice and helpful!\n\nI am only giving it three stars, however, because it definitely has room for improvement. I understand that they just opened and are still working through their identity, but I think they could do a little more than just meals or coffee. I am a huge tea drinker and am unimpressed with their tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea is usually my favorite, and all of theirs fall short. They could use a few fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. \n\nI also they should expand on their \"snack\" section too. I am not sure if this is something they want to do, however, if they want to be a weekday coffee shop, offering some little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go a long way for the student who doesn't want a full meal, but just a little something to hold them over.\n\nAll that being said, their breakfasts are absolutely amazing and their coffee and espresso selections great.

I've been here a handful of times but only eaten there twice. Their homemade English muffins are delish! I had mine with some jam. I've also had their avocado toast. It's poached eggs on homemade bread and alfalfa sprouts with plenty of avocado on the side. It comes with a side salad as well. It's really good but heavy on the alfalfa sprouts, I took most of them off and it was just fine after that! Their setup is nice, but windows, plenty of seating and even a handful of plugs if you want to do some work, which I appreciate. \n\nTheir service leaves something to be desired though. Weekdays they only have counter service, which is understandable because most people are there to work while they have coffee and probably don't want to be bothered but still, some attention would be nice. I had to find my own utensils etc and the girl at the counter completely forgot that I was the one that was waiting for food, after only a few minutes. \n\nI'm all for good customer service so that was a little disappointing but I will still go for coffee and pastries.

Aside from that, this place has a few things to take care of. When you advertise as a brunch spot, you know that you are going to get crowds. In fact, expect crowds on a Saturday morning. We live a few doors down from Toast and we've been excited to go for some time now. We arrived around 10:50am and placed our orders. We received our food around 11:35am. That is quite long for some breakfast, just saying. We watched not ONE but THREE tables get up and leave because their food took an immense amount of time. It seemed that two were locals and the other 4 people were tourists and on a schedule. It was very awkward to see every table looking around to see why the food takes so long. I find it incredible that THREE tables left and a manager or someone pulls aside the waitress, reprimanding her. I feel that management is the issue here, not the waitresses. How would they control the time that the food takes? \n\nAnywho, food is great but service SUCKS! If you are looking for a quick brunch, stay away.

Meal took longer than expected, but I think the tiny kitchen had only one worker and there was a 2-top order just before ours went in.  However, we got done in time to make our meeting.\n\nPeople, plates and cups need to be warmed in the winter prior to having food loaded onto or in them.  Stuff got cold quickly.  My eggs were very good, although they didn't taste much like eggs.  Rest of the plate was also pretty good, except that the salad was cut in a way that it was hard to eat neatly.  Mushrooms were also very good, but likely canned.\n\nMy big gripe is that I like to mop up soft-cooked eggs so I don't waste any yolk, which to me is the reason to eat eggs.  However, no toast.

You won't find some of the basics: eggs your way, pancakes... you know what I mean. BUT! you will find a fresh perspective with a fresh ambience, fresh service, fresh food, and a fresh view of the street corner from any seat in the house.\n\nThe quirky highlight - the toast theme. Toast takes eggs benedict to different level. It's not that dish smothered in hollandaise. Instead, there are seven varieties called \"egg toasts,\" all $10.50 or less. Still poached eggs sitting on top of english muffin (they're fresh baked on premise), but the toppings vary. \n\nWe ordered the \"warm apples\" egg toast that came with baked apple, sausage, and white cheddar. Delicious, appropriate and \"responsible\" portion (read: not so big that you'll feel like junk after), and served with a side salad. Perfect size for E-money.\n\nI had the egg sandwich. Starts at $2.50 and then you pay extra for things like tomato, avocado, cheese, bacon/sausage, etc. Bacon ($1.75), avocado ($2), and smoked gouda ($1) were my choices with their delicious english muffin (couldn't tell you which cheeses are available - smoked gouda was the first i heard and i stopped our server there). Other \"toast\" choices include white, wheat, baguette, bagel, croissant. \n\nThe sandwich didn't disappoint. Cheese wasn't melted, which let the taste of the smoked gouda really come through. Egg is fried. Add some ketchup and Tapatio hot sauce and you can't go wrong.\n\nOur side of turkey sausage was a-ok, but nothing to get excited about. Curious as to whether they make the sausage or bring it in.\n\nCoffee drinkers can expect a good cup of joe - E-money is super picky about coffee but she gave Toast's warm cup a ringing endorsement. If you prefer tea, like me, then you'll be pleased with the variety. I had ginger mint!\n\nReally enjoyed our breakfast at Toast. Showed up a little after 10am  on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait, a tough thing to come by these days with the brunch craze. I bought their dark chocolate, sea salt brownie when I paid for the bill up at the counter - looks awesome.\n\nExpect to see me back at Toast in a hurry - you should probably follow suit.", "date":

I LOVE the way its decorated inside. The setup is perfect for a weekend space to meet friends.\n\nYou can stop in and pickup things to go, or you can dine in and sit inside or outside. I stopped in a few times, and it seems like once in awhile people pop in to get work done. As far as I know there isn't wifi, but there are plenty of outlets. I was able to setup my laptop and hotspot from my phone, and the servers were completely fine with it. \n\nI LOVE their tea. It's DELICIOUS. Unfortunately, they don't always have all of them stocked so make sure you ask the server what is available before setting your heart on something. \n\nThe Bacon Avocado egg toast is delicious, but like others have said, I'm confused as to why the cheese isn't melted. That might set this meal over the top because who doesn't love melted cheese AMIRITE?!\n\nWhat I liked even more was the breakfast sandwich (sausage egg cheese avocado) with a side of scalloped potatoes. DELICIOUS.\n\nThe egg toasts come with a small side salad, which they do not write on their menu. I felt bad for one man that was dining and ordered a side salad, and the server foolishly didn't tell him that his meal would be coming with one, and ended up charging him for both, even after he made it clear that she did not advise him that he would be getting two salads. I was a bit put off by that as she didn't apologize and made it seem like it was his fault.\n\nAlso, even though it isn't advertised, I think they give you 10% off if you instagram your meal and tag them in it.Overall this place needs better transparancy. From reading my own review back it's clear the servers could do a better job of explaining their menu and what items may be out of stock, as well as the discount opportunity. Since I'm feeling generous, I'll leave them at 4 stars!", "date": "2015-05-05 21:28:50", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "LwuHCmFSeFhCGeschjwmnQ", "name": "Ancy",

Ate brunch with my boyfriend yesterday and was overall super happy with everything, although there were some blips they could work out to be full 5-star material.  First, I was served my delicious hot coffee in a cute mug - with no milk or sugar or even a spoon.  I had to carefully carry the hot mug over to the milk/sugar station across the room (it is a small room, so that's good), and then hunt for a clean spoon since there were none available at the station.  If you're serving sit-down brunch, your patrons should be able to remain sitting while prepping their coffee.\n\nThe food was also really good, but also not consistently awesome across the board.  My boyfriend had the smoked salmon with poached eggs and hollandaise on their homemade English muffins.  It was amazing 0 the hollandaise was just the right amount of lemony and thin to feel refreshing, not gloopy and fatty.  His English muffin was also tender and delicious.\n\nMy dish, on the other hand, had a very hard English muffin, on which some slices of a less-than-good avocado were perched atop sprouts and then topped with poached eggs and a side of roasted tomatoes.  The tomatoes were bomb and the eggs and sprouts were fine, but the avocado sucked.  They even had the black strings in them - that's just not a good avocado. This whole dish would have been 10 times more delicious with pesto, so hopefully they read this and add it :)\n\nIt seems like some of the staff were new and there's definitely potential to improve the little inconsistencies at Toast.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Philly.", "date": "2013-11-04 19:59:16", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "V5_yOb5GKm0khcrXGOzJcA", "name": "Lily", "review_count": 33,

They actually have an extensive menu with salads and eggs benedict (around $10) as well as cheaper toast/bagel options. \nThe one barrista is super sweet, the first time I came in when she was working, she was so friendly I had to stop and figure out if I knew her and she was actually a best friend I'd forgotten I had, or just super awesome. It was the latter. She also took pity on us and brought us water after we'd been miserably staring at our screens/books for a few hours.\n\nCONS\nDrinks are a bit overpriced (2.75 for a tea?) and they don't have a huge selection of teas. \nThe AC was spotty last week, but they've resolved the issue I think.\n\nHighly recommend as a study spot, or a place for weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining. So let's raise a toast to Toast, and hope this one sticks.", "date": "2013-06-03 03:42:49", "useful": 3, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "VClMTiHXXYlLNjalD3N4XQ", "name": "Melissa",

The first morning I enjoyed the Omelette du Jour which had a savory filling of roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, and wilted spinach. It was accompanied by a crisp small side salad of baby greens, tomato, and berries. The house dressing was light and complementary, not at all over powering. I just HAD to complement the chef. The barista recommended a pour over coffee and it did not disappoint. He prepared my cup with care and attention to time and form. I followed the pour over with a wonderful latte, again prepared very well. As I was leaving town, I decided to visit again for breakfast before my long trip ahead. This breakfast was a delicious Eggs Benedict combo that was perfectly done and complemented by mushrooms, roast tomato, and a generous helping of wilted greens. A rich cup of melted butter accompanied the dish and the sweet side salad again brought balance to my meal. This time the barista made me a perfect cup of French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It was balanced and bright, yet rich in flavor. I had to have a second cup to go! Cudos to the barista, chef, and friendly staff. Toast is definitely a place to visit, eat, and enjoy coffee prepared in a variety ways.

I can't have undercooked egg yolk at the moment, so I said you don't have to scramble them just break the yolk and cook it.  But then I realized the root of the miscommunication was she missed me saying egg sandwich and thought I wanted the poached egg platter.  I needed something I could shove in my face on the go so I had to get it remade (which I hated to do), but despite the mixup and wait - the girl helping me remained pleasant and took care of both issues no problem.   I bring up the mix up because it was handled as well as it could have been.  And the sandwich I ended up with was amazing.

They don't mind me hanging out for a few hours on a weekday to get some work done while enjoying coffee and an egg sandwich.  Way better food and ambiance than chain coffee shops - this is a great place for a casual morning business meeting.\n\nWe've been to visit for Sunday brunch too.

The light ginger taste was barely there, though; the mascarpone flavor was more prominent despite the bits of candied ginger within it\n\nNook Cafe is a lovely neighborhood place to get a beverage and some freshly baked goods, hang with friends or do work.

Decided to commit to trying out a new gem and whipped out my handy dandy Yelp app. \n\nI wanted somewhere with a cool vibe, cozy and inviting yet would put me in the mood to read/get some work done...with a good cup of coffee in hand. I definitely got that here. This place epitomizes service with a smile. They're efficient and my chai latte was YUM (best I've had in quite some time) and I liked how they asked me up front what kind of milk I wanted. (Also I think good coffee temperature is underrated; I've been to a lot of places where the non plain black coffees are lukewarm by the time they're done with their 'art'.) I got some reading done, and some people watching by the big window facing the street. \n\nThe furniture is a little worn..almost shabby to he honest, in a \"well loved\" sort of way. There is a ton of artwork on the bathroom walls; looked like they were for sale but I personally wouldn't purchase anything that's been in a public restroom. Instead of all the art, I'd rather have a mirror in the bathroom (there isn't one so couldn't retouch my lipstick as I wanted). I also wish the hand dryer didn't blow ice cold air on to my already freezing hands... especially if there is no paper towel option.", "date": "2018-11-14 01:33:04", "useful": 5, "funny": 0, "cool":

The name and logo is cute, which goes pretty far in my book. However, if I knew how amazing my latte was going to be, I would have made it a point to come here sooner! \n\nI stopped in this morning and was so pleasantly surprised. The people were friendly and they took my credit card for an under-$5 amount, so I was already happy. The decor is nothing amazing or incredibly cozy, but since I wasn't hanging out, I won't knock them down on that. Then, my latte came up super quick, which was fantastic since I was in a bit of a hurry. I was seriously in and out in less than 5 minutes, which is more than I can say for any, ahem, large coffee chains in the area... and then I tasted the latte. It was seriously perfect. The man who made it obviously knew what he was doing, and I sincerely appreciate it. It was seriously so good. \n\nI am already looking forward to coming back and trying one of those baked goods that everyone raves about... If they live up to my expectations, this place will definitely be 5 star in my book!

With the additional comfy seating they offer, it's a really nice place to catch up with friends as well!\n\nFood: Personally, I thought the latte I got was average and tasted a bit diluted, so I probably wouldn't go back for their drinks. The coffee did come out very quickly, though. Also, they did have a really cute assortment of all their chocolates, including hand-made truffles, which I would love to try next time! The assortment of pastries included several gluten-free options (predominantly fudge) that looked delicious, and very affordable ($1-2). \n\nOverall: , mostly for the atmosphere and variety of pastry options they offered!

I discovered Nook about three weeks ago, and I've been here about five times since. It's seriously my favorite coffee shop of all time, not just in Philadelphia. \n\nFirst off, the coffee is absolutely amazing. I usually get a hand poured kind, but I've also had the house blend which was quite good, as well. Today was my first time trying the decaf Americano (one can only take so much caffeine in an afternoon...) and it's the first decaf coffee I've ever had that was actually GOOD.\n\nI also love the baked goods, but ESPECIALLY that you can get small baked goods! I almost never buy treats at other coffee shops because they're usually HUGE and I don't like having a meal's worth of calories for a snack. However, while Nook has some of these impressive, large specimens of baked goods, they also have tiny biscotti, small tea cookies, truffles, and all their cupcakes are available in small or large sizes. Their sandwiches are tasty and reasonably sized, as well. \n\nFree wifi, generally quiet atmosphere. As another reviewer mentioned, it can be a little hard to get work done on the small tables, but every time I've gone I've been able to score either two tables together or the larger bench-table thing. Not to mention if you're going to be there for a few hours doing work, tables will generally open up.\n\nThere's some couches/chairs in the back that look like they'd be a nice place to sit and talk with friends.\n\nThe owners are SUPER nice. So, so nice. I love when you go somewhere and can tell the people actually want to be there. \n\nDEFINITELY try Nook if you haven't already. 100% better than Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts or any other chain you can think of. The embodiment of an awesome, small-business coffee shop.", "date": "2012-12-17 20:31:34", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "rbIxDZHhx3nNRk0MrVIMKg", "name": "Erin",

Between Mike (the owner) and Amanda (their best barista) decades of coffee knowledge come together in a laid back, unpretentious environment with good music.\n\nNot only does this place offer a rotating menu for pour over coffee (Hario V60 of course) with some occasional tasting notes, it offers a high quality selection of beans from One Village Coffee and Gimme! Coffee all roasted usually within the past two weeks (of course the stuff they serve you is extra fresh by the nature of economy of scale). This is the place that I go to buy beans and grind fresh in my office. I was a lost coffee disciple wandering for years in Philadelphia, doomed to order coffee online and pay high shipping prices before I found this place. Also, for people who want coffee making supplies, they usually keep a table set up with a variety of grinders, french press, pour over, and other coffee making options. \n\nFor all of you non-coffee snobs have no fear! All the drinks are delicious and the bakery always provides a great snack. The quiche is particularly delectable, but a tad on the pricey side (on par or cheaper than Rittenhouse prices). The day old muffins are cheap ($1.25) and still very tasty! Come to work (free wifi with purchase), come to hang out, and if you feel up to it, come to love coffee as God intended - black pour-over at Nook.", "date": "2011-01-28 19:26:31", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "7mzs4UkiY1uUVjvw4QZBsw", "name": "Justin", "review_count": 3, "yelping_since": "2009-08-21 22:27:44", "friends": ["DgpHITohyaGvTkvWwonBtw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.67, "fans": 0}}

It's my favorite coffee bar (time passed). Mike is awesome and knows what he is doing and is very good with a dry cappuccino. I'm always pleased with what I get. Their pour-overs are made really well, and use great beans and is done correctly. Great cortados, too.\n\nEdna, the head baker, is fantastic.  Her eclairs are fantastic, and the chocolate cakes are rich.  The quiche is well done as well, and her mood is seemingly always effervescent. She also is not bluffin' with her muffin. The strawberry rhubarb one is sublime. As well as the lemon poppyseed or whatever is fresh. Everything is done in house. I also love the profiterole. I rarely have a sweet tooth, but if I do, they can make something that is not too sweet but perfectly robust with sweet flavor. \n\nI am always impressed at how well they all know their coffee and make everything well. They will never serve you a bad espresso, and they can tell if something is ever bad.  They will pour it out before they serve you something they do not feel is up-to-snuff.  \n\nThis place is phenomenal.\n\nFree wifi, good seating, nice art on the walls, clean, fine bathroom, all the accessories to a coffee shop you want, yadda yadda.

But had I have been able to gaze into the future and see such a welcoming and chill coffeehouse & bakery moving in close enough to compensate, I'd probably be there for the long haul!\n\nIn a city where most Indie coffeehouses are dominated by La Colombe, it is refreshing to see one that hooks up small batches of local and regionally roasted coffees, and some that are even available hand poured. Especially when that very same spot features plenty of seasonal baked goods that are made from scratch on site!\n\nThe first thing that I noticed when walking into Nook was all of the vintage decor and interesting art on the wall. And the second thing I noticed was all of the tempting goodies that ranged from scones and muffins, to quiches and fresh baked desserts. The main thing that caught my eye was the Marscarpone & Ginger Bars since I'm always looking for new ways to utilize that most silky of smooth cream cheeses. and each decadently light bite yielded the perfect after bite of crystallized ginger to make me a fan.

Unfortunately, I stand dumbfounded by the experience I had there this afternoon. We were offered a free small cup of coffee with our 20 minute wait time for a table of two, which, in my opinion, a wait at any breakfast spot is to be expected on New Years Day. After waiting about 40 minutes, we were told our table would be ready in \"under five\" and waited an additional 10 minutes. For the extensive wait, a barista downstairs offered us a complimentary muffin, which was an appreciated gesture. \n\nAfter finally being seated, our bespectacled waiter asked us if we wanted a coffee or a beverage outside of the water on the table. We asked for two coffees with cream. After waiting 5+ minutes for our coffee, the waiter came back to our table profusely sweating and again asked if we wanted coffee. We let him know we wanted two coffees with cream and were ready to order our food. He replied \"oh great easier for me! What can I get you?\" Our coffees arrived soon after without cream. After waiting about ten minutes for the cream, we realized it must have been forgotten so we politely asked our waiter for it and his reply was \"in a minute.\" We then asked a neighboring tables waitress for cream who immediately brought it over from where our waiter was standing when he said \"in a minute.\"\n\nAt this point it had been about 20 minutes since we placed our order with our waiter. The neighboring table, that ordered after us with the other waitress, had been eating their meal for at least 5 minutes. We considered getting up and leaving but didn't feel it was the right thing to do and assumed our food was on its way out. Our waiter then approached the table and asked if we had any questions. We stared back at him mystified, so he added \"about the menu.. or are you ready to order.?\" We reminded him that we already ordered and he proceeded to itch a strange rash on his neck (with a hand that was so scabbed up it looked like it was caught in a garbage disposal) and asked if we placed the order with another staff member. At this point, we told him we had placed our with him a little more than 20 minutes ago. Knowing our order never made it to the kitchen, we decided to get up and leave. The waiter laughed anxiously and we assured him it was okay, but neither of us have ever experienced something like this before. \n\nI can't really speak to the quality of the food here because I unfortunately did not get to really try it. While some staff members were super accommodating and helpful, others seem unable to appropriately handle the stress of the job.", "date": "2020-01-02 03:34:26", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "0OGsjSZQ9IGsPq1ui3fJIA", "name": "Chalys\u00e9", "review_count": 4, "yelping_since": "2016-08-24 12:36:24", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 2.4, "fans": 0}}

Got there at noon and waited 20min for our waitress to come over. We ordered tea and coffee that then took over a half hour to come and only got there because the other waitress asked if we wanted refills on our nonexistent drinks. We had to ask what the specials were because our waitress forgot to tell us as well. After ordering food we waited another hour for it to arrive and when we asked where it was she said she only just put it in 10min ago. Tables who were seated after us received their food and left before we got ours. Took an hour and a half total for our food to finally get there and nothing was comped or discounted. We were so upset by the service we just asked for the food to go instead and only realized when I got home that one of the orders was wrong and didnt even feel like going back to complain. A guy downstairs, who had nothing to do with our order or service, even accused us of lying about how long we waited and said we were only there for 25min, because he is apparently omniscient. Its one thing to make a mistake but at least rectify it by discounting the check and you never accuse the costumer of lying or being wrong. But dont worry, we got a nice \"we'll get you next time\" when we were leaving. Might be waiting a bit for that one though... If you're going to order from there stick to the take out", "date": "2019-08-03 17:54:56", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "6ooS-VHjBbu9GOH2dwIpNg", "name": "Ryan",

We put an order for drinks and we're not served them until the 2nd time we asked for them. After 70 minutes of waiting a new waitress walked up and told us that they had just submitted our order. Beginning to end, the worst dining experience I've had.

The funny thing is I defended this place for so long, while my boyfriend almost instantly saw through it.  \n\nTheir menu should have a huge SUBJECT TO CHANGE stamp on top.  One time my boyfriend and I were having brunch upstairs.  He tried to order *THREE* different things.. they were \"out\" of all of them.  Lol what?  That's fine if you're out, but maybe the server should give a warning (it's not ridiculous, I've seen it).  Another time at brunch, I ordered a mimosa.  The server said \"we're out of mimosas, can I get you something else?\" So I (clearly begrudgingly) settled for white wine.  My boyfriend also wanted a mimosa.  The server goes \"OK hang on....\" and then brings him a mimosa and me a white wine lol WTF?\n\nAnother time, I stopped in just for tea before I left for work.  In the middle of my order, the barista had to take a call.  The customer who called in was ordering a breakfast sandwich for pickup.  I thought to myself, \"that's a great idea,\" so I added an egg white and tomato on rye toast to my order.  So I was very confused when my total was $9.60.  When I confronted the barista about it, he broke it down for me (the \"sandwich\", egg white, and tomato were all separate costs).  I canceled the order (they hadn't started making it yet) and explained why I thought that made no sense --a sandwich so simple just shouldn't cost $7.00-- to which the OWNER responded, \"Well why don't ya just make it at home next time.\"  YEAH OK NO.  Never went back.  Rude as fuck.  \n\nOK sorry and I just have to call them out on this... \"free mimosa\" means free shot of a mimosa... if they have it that day.\n\nJust FYI there are more instances, but I'm not going to list them all.\n\nAs a non-Philly native, I can only hypothesize that the people are just used to subpar service..?

They told us a five minute wait which was no big deal. Another couple walked in about 3 minutes after us and they were offered complementary coffee or mimosas, and I thought that was odd since none were offered to us, and we had already been waiting there some time. Our 5 min wait ended up turning into 10-15 and we were seated for breakfast. Now the food wasn't terrible. It was good, however, very greasy. If you love that in your breakfast then this is a go to place. I just find greasy food to be a way of masking good quality. I had a simple breakfast composed of eggs, potatoes, and rye bread, so I was shocked to see that much grease and disappointed as I knew it would end up giving a sore stomach later. Our waiter was very polite and made the breakfast a bit more enjoyable, but I just didn't find the entire experience too impressive overall. They also didn't accept cards as we learned upon our entrance which was a decent inconvenience for us and seems a bit backwards for the times(especially since their machine charged $2.75). I probably won't be heading back because I don't care for overly greasy food and I didn't find it to be that great of an experience.

Tasted a lot like one I could scoop up at Dunkin'.. cute concept. I'll have to try some other drinks and some food before bumping up my star rating.", "date": "2019-02-17 17:13:12", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "k0ItOdfAkjrvH7Hj-u7lVg", "name": "Kelsey", "review_count": 133, "yelping_since": "2017-11-15 02:04:21", "friends": ["_IB4eyXjBTlJNx-3e85zsg", "4eXZEly8jnwFQv0Qykn5VQ", "spBRt-e-Xg2YKzFutEEKpQ", "Koqu79-Mkh-EW3cMx6F_TA", "ohIkroL0fazkxWII_Iue8A", "G_CUdFuTBU8fXVsj0hna5g", "lFGhvU45wEVDTQ--hPJCzg", "6fLRMt8qsthgu8ZmQhr28w", "RE-WDELXg7-o9N7NLNtOZQ", "JxrT8T4CveWOjLRCgRCIvw", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "Ti8q9fP5Ty0F3-fjw68TJA", "bkqBXMra3ZJyJmklNTKy9g", "BpQgZDStGwkETpTyS018jw", "1yajUaCqR0nw90AtibHxPg", "DCrK1PMSNbWI3gJuvVKetw", "fj1YEDV4zAQd0-BXkjBgOQ", "rRgBPvTDL2ZgKnQwzOMc3g", "uLfj9_gItRR-rjIRb6zR1A", "zhROep62c_icbztjxLsKRA", "0gHIwx0l74pIjd1wFJkHiw", "fK1WCjCRYtyRS1Rp9v7q4g", "_lWB7FMdc8KN6crbNQVnlg", "kGtPbNBwtdS2kNlnF7p3Jw", "7_UlXh3l7cm0SwSxkrwjkw", "tIuv5LuaIivfYgSfmKam7w", "9N3gVPFOHOBOdIc4y4pwqg", "7HWZZqn32s8kK-hEnLfhnQ", "gpBxQHf7Bu8qE8cD_ouEdg", "BmVwbsL8l0imz4slonyMaA", "lTJ9A5KFF6trNMCXbxbNEA", "oSC0J_DV_ZVKedyjVXB5VA", "6A5mox4OdHQfIjqmwzsrvg", "yKBfUWF-NK22VW4dqh-1Jw", "CH3P_St0aC2ADQP_2_JyMQ", "lT7JZx-M5hWwoVGxkWsq8A", "6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q", "wCvvl_QsA577nwqQLYFtkA", "4c5Tl-OUplcnTTyOdyh2Sw", "gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw", "TTX7ZxxYsG6V3OAjViCVnQ", "nfd0OBaFdJvOE8OdYFr8Hg", "vBrY4PCbIfWQXA0xjGzYYw", "HDkIX9JdtRgHX3pERoQi9w", "Vf_-yum6WtzixwDzMK9S_Q", "BGt39ZePo9fYg0daNwGc0w", "DDAhLHZOqVTeplc6wx0TAg", "0c9z3XszCZh35l95Qx7YjQ", "0EDm6vk06IxwfclK_d7EhQ", "A0w_gyAyeVESl0P0n1KH3w", "3r-H3bquO8zxJlhsI9TqeA", "M4S2QNU1EDs8-WFizdPxMw", "ptFxHpH29zvIOG9RXZiJWw", "q14Zp1DzCVYyLFhc04B2aA", "edsF0zD7BJvlYIcwnzmJNA", "mVUbi203o1qE8ORxEls9mA", "zgAoVHCifirzEeN8P6h2UQ", "yjk5xIhfZ4iOpfdMy0_tfw", "Kknhepmk9D3zQjPeV8ofVQ", "tzTdlUg6STRD73z7_aVt4A", "jWN-BgwCh210KzFUmDi53A", "C0tFSppgU27fU8cBbkR4Fw", "z9XQFu4lN1ndotHbhVs36g", "nfVXlqhk1iYpP2cUmw7a9Q", "ohuN16Af29imsDF6XxMfmg", "EBG0-BFB-G7ug03D6vhEMA", "AdqdKjREs01ryjfvaP3Usw", "y1BME7oHvn5wF557ddlsBg", "G5Ftj9AkyvX124B-My9c6A", "0Iaad0E7wbnCuCYMYKhYQA", "sKtqZXR1O_HP8stelz8GUw", "LvwGyHbICymXqG931hVf5Q", "Vqoy_0oJqy8MXZHPjd6c9g", "ZARMhTygFt2A-LoG6doExQ", "CIptUtQEbecnlNTuORxMCw", "neOnebovhpfUPm1GQUMdSg", "RmZVXtfWhW70UdVDZ9KPtA", "AdZk9r8GSN_ZG4ETmPl9EA", "t0pcaLJxjPICH3bqOsvwYQ", "g-hEIxowkuntjyvBcVV4rw", "VHeuL_qtAtDO6oMvXxzN5Q", "EgVXmwUIej5jnv_m6bx86Q", "FE8-1BzLRezVn0dZ0TWsMQ", "xzdak7G1Iu8FWuvEvv4KRw", "4dd60_aKfOMLyXGd0jYPXA", "NocmwJNXztVRrIISsj-SFA", "GY8CFWw2GCNl3RjpfU5Rkg", "kq1ZImORYVaIyelAZ57ECA", "UZdXjo8mOyG3l4BE8wvMFw", "o4eMIRoDmYGiJONk8HnZ_A", "KTD0cKjfQJiX4BG-XR2Jbg", "f97QErQSyMdQqpSHCZsanQ", "O7YByz8DQOn031hc18BiTg", "KcEQmtj9LRtzHF-bP7u4yw", "g7Amkl0y5w_vfUpLN0rqrg", "s-rU8hz81NtRfmXp9EZL3w", "N2JXHgPSkcQNK9ZhbEHnMg", "-Bq79h_dVUQIKrztBhRs2w", "j1Ki5SE5zARIRwMmFUDskw", "8ddrlqxgvZmQWdPogO80Gg", "7Q7rw6nxhQdggIdk4WsRLg", "DkZNvNvDZtkKGtfqV9yCsA", "_0KTCkybneqNNIerxiEzMw", "qy_7etuwCvcC41zselNGtg", "8_tWCvhVsCzpBeC-WZFV4A", "q-xu1VTiQhKhh5eFxfKWEw", "v6B6jYmCpnfM1TxiiJXFGw", "ZMbAX99GYLsE7yj-l7Ryeg", "OZKnojVg0lpq7dmLIXVpiQ", "kHjIT5rpR3-gcbCzUIG_VQ", "I11cB9EL-rKM7lfhMcMfGw", "6pPqBTibIWnGpD2QpBsSnA", "UI-KrqlrtXuDlqpeNOB9VA", "rrykcW62AN8IZsKkxtRnpg", "c61zT7qRkAdy3mlzY-4kGg", "8eG50b10lZGa58_pymDkGQ", "N2q3_fkiInOCyOG_UiP9hQ", "4Cf6RQK-6lIKrC1Zt_pPTQ", "sigobs6k5PM1X-5Nt5ygYw", "ax7BHglDxldgt5AO5-wE4A", "N0Ugcml_xtCkwJLKiQo-RA", "dWpKiv08gD0Bcf9FT-RCug", "2LWEE7a9sOf4BDZxPs4Gpg", "y_bN7XPD4mX4U8sUaIjcEg", "0-KntKtzRJqX9TATHysTJg", "2rajytzamwAJKIts25AONA", "2tRYRT6qBqJGUdqAz5O58g", "8gzqq0OVv8cXrDeI_LG4fw", "ewPfofHowTkIcX50KpJ_ZA", "4BhfczYXXq7YShBcK76eZA", "peLCdt5UgNt6lv_uT6wP9g", "-9o9LPFe-fSUhF5FZ66nmA", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "WoccjO9wbW44dbLcYBvDGA"], "elite": ["2018", "2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 3.9, "fans": 11}}

To be perfectly honest, if it werent for the awesome reviews, we would have lived LITERALLY down the road and never came here (signage needs some word, you need to stand out a bit more!).  We went into it knowing we wanted to binge.  We ordered (to take out because we work from home) the meatball parm sandwich with steak fries and the chicken cutlet sandwich with steak fries.  I asked on the phone about how much it would be and also how long it would take.  He informed me that with the steak fries (a little extra) it would be about $20 (not too bad I guess but I hope theyre big decent sandwiches because for 10$ a plate, I hope it's large).  He told me to give him 10 minutes- that's where I nearly fell in love!  I so appreciate them getting it out so quickly!  This place is cash only but they do have an ATM so thats good.  When I went to pick up the food I was delighted at how quick the process was, in and out and the parking was awesome too.  The food turned out to be excellent and well worth any amount of money.  Tons of food (I had a LOT of leftovers- but then again the chicken cutlet sandwich is a heavy dish and very filling).  My boyfriend LOVED his meatball parm and the steak fries were done perfectly.  Just the perfect experience.  Please know that if you choose the meatball parm or chicken cutlet sandwich, dont expect to feel light after; this is definitely like comfort food so dont come here on a diet. \n\nAll in all, great job guys!! Delicious and pleased and looking forward to coming back and sitting down upstairs.", "date": "2014-10-29 17:42:00", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "fo2c2mfebLM-5x0iFU3ZJA",

I have ordered food to go a few times and it's great. The place itself is a little small but I think it makes for a fun environment. We came here on a Sunday for brunch (well really lunch bc it was about 1pm) and it was a short wait- I don't think it's typical of a Saturday but we were grateful.\n\nThe upstairs space is up a flight of stairs that are kind of steep- just be careful coming down those things. It's smallish but cozy. Definitely makes for a louder environment but I wasn't bothered by it.  The service was great- everyone was friendly and quick. We were given free muffins and our choice of a free drink- OJ, mimosa or Bloody Mary. I had the Bloody Mary as I nursing a hangover. There's soo many good food options !!! I opted for the sweet waffle sandwich- fried egg, pork sausage with melted Brie stuffed between two wee waffles. Literally the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Delicious. Reasonably priced as well. Also, it's cash only!!! \n\nThey have a quite on the front their menu that I truly believe they live by as evidenced by their service & attentiveness : \"We are in the people business serving food\" \n\nI can't wait to come back and try more fewds!!", "date": "2019-03-10 19:08:53", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "OnwTYfNMvuEMuNHTdVGjxg", "name": "Lorean", "review_count": 104, "yelping_since": "2012-09-03 12:57:45", "friends": ["h0S8Hceh4sGgA-fTjpcWdg", "ebx5i5NAHRlttyAoGMBJQA", "t5uYEnyfx0WpMEYX4iDWdQ", "H7aUl4FPad_c8Mx_8Rt8Ww", "onVdFB7En2BllCOrYXPdlw", "U04U0_GA0BShBJYFdFLPow", "HhoFVfzIOUQetCBLqYPQTw", "vB8NyyP6BifCS2WYdb8hlA", "MeOtMR_wlFVet9Q9dHvXtQ", "Fx9v6oSwFat33FQdbu_Sag", "3PNe7uQ77OmjUzBM7LIJAw", "OaxAiAyf6ei3imUuKwOXvA", "jfrtBSG8xvlYo64Ogu43gw", "nYYlF7M-arBUCmtJaG2tSA", "KYWzQ6MQK6Dxbzjtl3KS9A", "PIfIXJr3UlQlFguOV7816A", "upIrmf4RFkPensPa3-2J8w", "SjI5g2IwaFzi2T_zIs0RLw", "pIDN_EFFws6HmMXT_07Pow", "2oJnDEdmefnQnTOTU_rAJA", "5iRQWvSnIoNvVcKOHZ5BIw", "JqT50qzJyHd5LS2KC1Jn2A", "_5cDYScgAqKDFpOkAxixtA", "Xu1of6ldbLbqj9HupKDs6A", "4E3oGGGSoQv0XhtkEDyz_Q", "y21YDhrbV0vInwApiQl6GA", "UA2N3T3EA-9mGJwDeQWVog", "1Dvzv2bBWqfT9Kl60JdyaA", "0CKAaipDXSlFllhPDMdwew", "_tyb1yEgBBofmxgyAsuAzg", "Gj15WyKTRB1Vl7v6-eLJwA", "2R9F9zwZL3iffwv62X_5rg", "aHaz8XIa39PGWW6IqhXE6w", "JSo6QztlEs92U6U6NQ84Pg", "AfyI0xjg7_TqL4JQG7srjg", "kfgB0V8IpUwwS-pPLMsO6A", "Cgpi7usZ925fSC4uwgBzlA", "lalCTdWflKxKfH485Xum-Q", "KdL4ap-mr9zogf5daGImDQ", "zdL2FcUXlfjUpfGTZCGxVg", "LlkX-_c7d9dr-RuBY77K1A", "z7fUiRHlTP3JZ1ymEaf_GQ", "uxR-4Zffh1e9SdUsRjZQrw", "Q5DnmgFZTICd35HkhLgIfQ", "TF_VPjv54aPvYxa8-_KvLg", "0ag9zG7jzklzejwAVaLG9Q", "raowmRjGr5NtIIzSj-Nyhg", "VKvhf3CzPGC0dVW3yjkDew", "OwFh2EQw1-UGmsS7i3jGUA", "moqir0wtBUAxUUJCN-i1cg", "REY4JnZ1Ev5jAuot1SvzCQ", "M3k3irsrqwtVLBs8Ac5lNw", "8nLcTEacWUNV_GS8QxEXfQ", "aDmx5f5EIeeTgk1xuczhTw", "C7dPe-4iDbFJYBjaz4a3QQ", "qzFNsTN-XH8ASe0NrPmj9g", "eUZN-kDDBwkp5cxRisvDvQ", "FulHrxDu2fGH9KqK4WtKbQ", "ueMkyXULSuvtgMjNXMw3Gg", "Wuga1ib2RbFR6ZJyCFNveg", "ksVlKdIA_X_q0HP_ODr0lA", "Ak9b_afOhPFOCApDaeqlrg", "n7VTcg4-F94ziJ4eRERSdw", "zHWQe2LR1EgRSqvgO-A1ow", "tUFZxtlT7GTUchnid3eQlw", "n-i31A9Ln54qtPqRnYgkoA", "oO37iepuG_bOVzCTYLB0SQ", "cGLd7AawOKtHh3WEn72WOA", "2Z10K2BFt3FgvYaleQrjVQ", "Q_NH4heYGmsJyDkvedB6lQ", "Au-91zZTPMXRJThQNSv82Q", "wR5IJp5gSyhgBx2i-XVFSw", "J41qnuy5zSmJlkxYPLuxwg", "P3SR8qRw6cS6WLgERRRKaA", "U0jvecBkvLVK9tktC3mdKw", "qRHp-sQGmCcAyTK-dPiH8A", "1YkcMjUSKyOhZULN1iAZ-g", "M8anMRGf0QLptUSAL3lFuQ", "lEy6YRJ7SKJXVrVYYenySA", "hwRZrAOcXcGZHlsBz08dnA", "NdS8_-vIzSl75o_Du23MXg", "I8a2Z22-RVlMQ--REhJIFA", "UZOm2svtUK-lGt4oTvh4LA", "7Dz0mkzmMRsTw7Bhtc6AgA", "eAYyPwGQ-Am-sOvCHI8Hqw", "yJ6gtnoVb-4kB8iaXA_eNw", "tbXrJQgayXHyhVq-zrJ5-A", "qkRUCSRTGEtU-jbejpdOdA", "m10MlA4sj2wkMUHPdBiM5g", "qRPCpGdHptvOeqsD_XxHGA", "eKIZTJAoYQApa3qGZI766g", "CjOwwAjdzhDiKduFnX176A", "xlTDzRodR8kizT9GnBUL9w", "ZhPDbbNr4T9N1f0f_0aO5A", "vy5FFn9zVZgvPBGqXkE0qw", "R4y5LKADgYgi7EQu43_IPA", "5zb_3qQCrFa3vn6ro5Dn6w", "ykib1BfH6li1doLE0kILUQ", "u9e_PNq3cFWPwMAZE7hT3Q", "_9LTCLd0XgrfDBT06otg6A", "50ilaxJJDm8dHzhQR02jvA", "T2ryJtdFUU6V__VatvH2lg", "a5k1cDynsBMB621KupQtdw", "iBHRdq1NG_qjTxIfTLHb1w", "XhvJEVfuJsKO5EmePJPdDg", "5f9cBagnsixolKcwjUguIQ", "HjNNLtKm2gamjiZWgt0SHg", "SQXsow-nuLYYQnTcsIedIA", "Kv8IP-mOZY_qAipeXAsGVw", "81rZvsdpvKZWdTOW-X8RTA", "1T2M8TaqhIzQIZPUWgn1kA", "RyH5UUWEMaGsYN1RScJh3Q", "g2RElhDczmP6ZhpnYZL22w", "A5MlWvk54OtWVKlggqMZBg", "AcXbJxjA90Z3ZSyW5T-Ptg", "htsrwCUXskGfusdJf4Vi8A", "mVeHMKtdhvzDgBDGbK57gw", "aRFDw9Y03_ZyOA3zMMcMaw"], "elite": ["2019", "20", "20", "2021"], "average_stars": 4.13, "fans": 6}}

It's actually ridiculous that there's still a coffee shop where I might have to hit your atm, incur and atm fee, and pay with a $20 rather then swipe any credit card.\n\nAddition: won't take another star away, but you guys need to figure out a better system for ordering over the phone then having people in the store wait (sometimes in the middle of a transaction) while someone answers the phone and takes an order.

From Josh the manager, to Channelle (#5) our server, right to the guy bussing the tables, everyone made a nearly superhuman effort to welcome us and show something of their personalities. Under some circumstances that could have felt cloying, but with these folk it was totally genuine and not overdone. \n\nThe dining area was up a narrow steep flight of stairs with the names of Philly neighborhoods written on the risers.  Good idea for keep our eyes where we were walking to avoid missteps.  The second story was bright with windows facing east, and yellow/gold painted walls all around. Lots of chachkas and potted plants. Channelle was to us in a blink, offering great coffee and mimosas/bloodies/orange juice.  The breakfast menu was a large page with their signature dishes - Hangover Sandwiches, Regular Breakfast Egg Sandies, Omelets, Waffles, etc. Even before ordering a Pastrami Omelet and Original Hangover creation, we received two homemade muffins compliments of the house.  Alcohol and bakery sweets gratis, just because...and, Josh stopped by to introduce himself and inquire where we were from and how we knew about CH2. Pleasant conversation.\n\nI'm not a pastrami guy, but my companion sure loved the load of smoked beef, Swiss cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions that filled her 3 egg plate.  My Original Breakfast Hangover Sandwich was a glorious monstrosity of 3 more eggs, garlic buttered sesame seed loaf, cheddar, sausage and their hash browns all in the mix.  Put hash browns inside my eggs and you know one of the keys to my soul.  With the first bite, my eyes involuntarily rolled to the back of my head, and I am told I emitted a low yowl. My inner wolf was free for a moment. Don't remember, but it was that good.  Don't think I bit anyone.\n\nDoubtless, we will return to this or the other Coffee House Too in the near future.  We liked it a lot!", "date": "2016-07-25 02:35:27", "useful": 9, "funny": 5, "cool": 6, "user": {"user_id": "-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw", "name": "Gerald", "review_count": 3131, "yelping_since":

I think Sal may secretly put samples of food in my bag because he knows this fat chick will be ADDICTED!! - if your a fishtowner, or even a newbie that resides in Fishtown and the Coffee house II isn't your destination breakfast lunch place, then something is wrong with you!!! Or your just clueless! - I'm saying this because I was reading some recent reviews and came across the one that was negative and couldn't understand why someone would write so many lies - Ok, could they possibly be out of some ingredients, YUP because their slamming it each day and everything you order is FRESH FRESH FRESH - however the coffee house staff will do anything to Please the customer, anything!! - could they run out of mimosa? Yes since they give out 400 free shots per day! However if they were out, they will provide you with a different free shot of something, and then I wonder how could someone even Bellyache over something that is offered free? Hmmmm and then her post reads that the owner was rude to her - so I can only imagine that each time this chick went in, she constantly gave the staff a horrific time - and I say this because the Coffee House too's Staff is trained to always go beyond and above for their customers!!! (Shhhhh I've heard them get in trouble for not addressing the customer by their name) - it's sad that we live in such a world where people \"Look\" for ways to be negative,  I assure you, the Coffee House Too is the place for all - you won't be disappointed!!!", "date": "2015-03-16 14:49:12", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "HTLso7W2jX_fTZ7NCXJGtg", "name": "Annette", "review_count": 23, "yelping_since": "2008-09-08 18:28:59", "friends": ["gYbdR30YHuyEB8relxujqQ", "vRbZA5fzZhtOGJqi-A7-Xw", "vjYhQEWaYB8Pn5Uc8Gzueg"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.0, "fans": 1}}

Their food is sooooo good, I mean really good. 1980's Good!  They have never messed up an order, their food is always as delish as the Last time, their Coffee is always Steaming Hot, I have never had to wait longer then 5 minutes for my food.

This place is definitely an asset to the new and old folks of Kensington and Fishtown, Yes Kensington, because when you cross to the other side of York, that is KENSINGTON, and I dont care what your realtor told you, it's Not Fishtown =) and no matter how many times you say the North Side of york street is Fishtown,  it doesnt make it true  =)  However Coffee House Too is on the Fishtown side  =)  I would love if the place had indoor seating, and I would really love it if they were open till 12am, and if they delivered AWESOME!  I will continue to drive there for lunch,. order my steak sandwich and Sebastian's side of Bacon =)  Im gonna have to inform some of the Orig Fishtowners that this place even exists, its hidden on york st, the Fishtown side.  =)  not that they need any patrons the place is always packed and their food is still on point  simply delish.

I was told the coffee was really good.

This gave me time to look around, and try and decide on what I wanted to eat. The menu looked appetizing and it was hard for me to make a selection. I also noticed the pastries that were inside and they too looked good. \nWhen I placed my order I then noticed the CASH ONLY sign on the register but luckily there's an ATM right inside that's gonna charge you $2.99.  I ordered the 2 eggs & cheese w/bacon on brioche bread and the latte.  I was offered a complimentary OJ, mimosa, screwdriver or Bloody Mary.

Yesterday a co-worker was RAVING about how great Old City Coffee was and how they always have a delicious array of breakfast food to pick from on the counter. So I went! I figured, perfect time to try someplace new.\n\nShe was right, the food that I did purchase tasted amazing and the coffee was great! For this reason alone I feel bad about this review.\n\nHOWEVER, the service at the front counter was ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS. I don't know the girls name- she has short brown hair and had glasses on. When I walked in and asked for 3 of each type of muffin on display her response was \"you should of called in first\". In an annoyed, disgruntled way. She proceeds to tell me \"I dont think I can sell you all that\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? After back and forth she finally goes to the kitchen to ask if she can sell me the 9 muffins (mind you there are huge trays of them and bagels and biscottis and cookies). She comes back out and says \"I asked it's okay this time\". Really? How about how that will be the only time because I think  you're a rude, ridiculous and uncalled for. \n\nAs I was grabbing all my bags of food that I was so graciously allowed to purchase (please insert all the sarcasm you can think of) a petite Asian woman walks out of the kitchen carrying a plate of delicious looking scones and she goes \"I've got scones! you want some of these too!?\" Very happy, very nice. I literally asked \" Am I allowed? I was afraid the other girl was going to yell at me again. The woman with the sconces replies along the lines of \"of course! we bake them so people can enjoy them!\" \n\nMy interaction with this woman was great. My advice to you Old City Coffee? Loose the dead weight. If the person who greets your customers first thing in the morning is full of disdain and reprimands, they won't be back. I plan on going back, but If I see her at the counter, I'll turn around and walk out.", "date": "2012-04-20 20:26:48", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "rrBTdukmhum4Qm2MH_uJyw", "name": "Rachel", "review_count": 12, "yelping_since": "2012-04-20 20:22:24", "friends": ["QZvrt_W43m1HhPBn2oCbaw", "HpKLi9x6_EznoKLt5xYi7A", "2kwmWlJlRa98aNiunQ9yzA", "I7bGFDNRlKeZGUp-eMjUPA", "_Lq7dXEwY-Do83GoYBisCA", "dOZrsUPcwQjdIU1z1MpbjQ", "oCdIXbWF1ctMVXmKYIWOuQ", "WWZ1e_q647PrXzXYO_8yqQ", "RsAHaPWhAGfo5HAckbLejw", "sWYoZ9dn74CuHoc1A_LPBA"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.5, "fans": 0}}

I trashed the first coffee and got a Starbucks one!).", "date": "2020-12-26 19:58:18", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "Iurr4FpMkwPoUqtjS1JjYg", "name": "Jen", "review_count": 8, "yelping_since": "2018-08-28 18:29:44", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.88, "fans": 0}}

I ordered a large hot chocolate and a pastry. The staff seemed a little preoccupied with their personal dramas, going on and on about the night before in front of me while getting people's order together. \nSeemed Susie Q's story was so enchanting that she forgot how to make hot chocolate and I was given a watery mess I couldn't even drink a sip. When I went back up and nicely said something didn't taste right she told me \"I made it how it is supposed to be\". Thanks doll, but it tasted horrible. Another girl quickly took my cup and said she would make me another one.\nIt took a bit but I did get a fresh cup and it tasted much better and that girl apologized. \nSo much potential! Seems centrally located between a lot. There is a back room with a lot of tables and extra seating. There is only one bathroom for the entire place but its kept really clean.", "date": "2017-07-12 16:43:00", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "azEfTiM31JcoCaQca0R2Cw", "name":

I always thought it was fine although I'm not much of an aficianado to tell the difference. My drink of choice is a large iced Americano. It's just several shots of expresso over ice with water added. \n\nThe other morning we were working out at the Old City Sweat when boo started jonesing for a coffee. OCC is right around the corner so we stopped in the charming albeit steamy shop on Church St. There was a steady crowd and we waited patiently inline. I ordered my normal Americano and stepped aside while it was being made. Instead of pouring the expresso over the ice the barista poured the piping hot liquid into the cold cup and then added ice after.

I'm just warning you, you might miss the alley-like street that it's on.\n\nThe service was lacklustre.

On the plus side, the prices are pretty reasonable.\n\nI had an espresso and a cinnamon scone. Although the scone was delicious, the espresso (which I love, love love) was not made properly and had this slight, odd aftertaste which I could quite tell was the result of not cleaning the machine or from some kind of chemical residue from cleaning. Either way, I've had better.\n\nWhat makes them appealing (if you're not super concerned about how your coffee actually tastes) is their seating area. It's bright, cheerful, clean and quiet.

It's on a beautiful little cobblestone street in Old City just a stone's throw from Christ Church. It has a cute seating area with french doors and a couple of tables outside if the weather's nice. Sadly, though their hot coffee always seems oddly bitter to me and I can't figure out why since I know the beans they roast make good coffee. It's so weird, or maybe it's just my taste buds don't work at this exact longitude and latitude. \n\nWhen it comes to the food, though, I have yet to have something I like. I love biscotti so I bought one of theirs and not only was it the size of my arm, it was nearly impossible to bite into. The cookies are huge but tasteless and the muffins also huge but have a strange crumbly texture that has you anxiously trying to get a secure bite. I like my food smaller and of better quality.

I really love the strong coffee and sweet treats the Old City spot offers, the side street offers a quiet refuge from the hustle of old city.  However, why do the Batista's always seem to put out?  We do have to fill our own cups... they merely slap down the requested size and bark out the bill.   And if you ask for a treat behind the counter, or even a lb of coffee, get ready for the cold shoulder of quiet annoyance.  Stay away from the overpriced oatmeal (gross) but be sure to try one of the baked goods from the jars.  They make most of the treats on site and they are delicious.  If you are feeling brash, ask one of the baristas for the freshest batch.

I skip the green smoothie and plunge into that carb coma...\n\nWell, I go here for that.  They serve this wonderfully delicious thing called a Nuffin, a muffin made with no sugar, fruit and oats.  I normally don't eat heavy foods, but I really like this thing.  I think it's low-fat too!  Anyway, they have various flavors, and it really hits the spot... and gives me a carb coma.  That's why I don't eat many ... but after I eat one, even half of it, I feel my brain going into a fog, like I'm back in my warm cozy bed, so that's a nice feeling.  Except then I have to work - uh oh!  It's an indulgence that I can enjoy for breakfast, however, so that's why I love them.\n\nTheir freshly-roasted beans are really amazing too- they have one blend that just took my breath away - pricey, but delicious...a real treat.  I usually buy these for special dining occasions at home since they are so good.\n\nTheir brewed coffee?  I haven't had the pleasure of a decent cup in a long time, now, so I can't recommend it.  Missing the rich roundness  I identify their establishment with... maybe it's just personal taste.  Maybe they use a lighter roast, I don't know.\n\nBut I did like their set-up there, and love the space - early in the morning, it's bright, clean - shared newspapers to read and a nice big window opening onto the street.  I've always had nice service with a smile.\n\nOh, and they never use meat at the cafe.", "date": "2010-11-25 12:16:52", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "PQTI4lA4VflbfqhPXdGKUQ", "name": "Shakalohana", "review_count": 160, "yelping_since": "2008-04-11 13:53:45", "friends": ["mQ2QfkQ334E9hd1ph8MzsQ", "kynr32zFMbU-ValbbVxQOQ", "EJEV1WkgF4wA2VAjd3n36w", "RGhfqnZQCpwm1CxtIZ6mlw", "yP9Ky8pdpqIGm67pKFT0og", "Ba94GsyvdP5l5kka_XDkWw", "-om8SjUgPLhGyvKtG2tGkw", "NxuZ3S2Ek_eaPKHSY4kR-A", "6Mv-qMJyxSokCu8YFM1o0A", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "7Ax2hu_01E9mznK7H14JtQ", "_BcWyKQL16ndpBdggh2kNA", "xHzU9LKwxGHq7BNPA16gog", "AA8nNbj6bDhO30evGmQn1Q", "jzPqloh8KbqjajNsz6BeTA", "cntN1wM3P4LsL74E_ESrBw", "RgDVC3ZUBqpEe6Y1kPhIpw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.16, "fans": 10}}

So I have pretty regular experience with them, both purchasing drinks directly and individual drinks.\n\nThe basic rundown is that the quality of the coffee beans are by far above average. And the iced coffee is a demonic broth that will make you feel like you just injected rocket fuel directly into your veins. (Your stomach may quickly alleviate you of that feeling, if you suffer from reflux.) After talking to one of the Barrista's about this - I suggested they were slipping crack cocaine in there - she said that the iced coffee is a mixture of all the roasts of the day, brewed double strength. So, there you go. Douse it with liquid sugar and a healthy amount of milk to cut the acid, and expect to get a lot of design and coding done before you crash and want to sleep under your desk for a week.  \n\nThey also have something called Balzac's blend here that is quite good. If you've ever read Balzac's humorous and incredibly verbose essay on the benefits of coffee, well... Yeah. It is well named.\n\nI wouldn't suggest going here for bulk tea though. Though the tea quality is fairly high it is apparent that they don't sell much of it- every time I've bought it it has been fairly stale. I suggest Remedy tea on Samson between 16th and 17th.

We drink it all the time.  We have an espresso machine on the kitchen counter so we can satisfy the coffee urge whenever.  Oh, but we don't patronize Satrbucks.  I can't bring myself to do it.  There's one literally on every corner, and I think I'm afraid they're trying to take over the world.  I just can't bring myself to drop money in there, and they certainly don't need my dimes to stay afloat.\n\nThis presents a dilemma on occasion when husband and I are the road and out of our element.  We know the great little coffee shops in our 'hood, but elsewhere we're lost.  So we were really happy one sunny afternoon after a visit to the beautiful grounds of Christ Church to literally stumble on Old City Coffee.  It's totally out of the way and tucked on a side street off Market, and I'm not sure we ever would have visited otherwise.\n\nBut.  The interior was so darn cute -- minimalist and all about coffee, with barrels of beans ready for you to select -- and the coffee was so darn good that we came back again and again.  The coffee was ground and then brewed right before our eyes, served piping hot, and was STRONG.  Yessss.  We were really happy with our experience!  Even picked up some airtight glass jars to store our beans and grounds at home.", "date": "2010-04-03 15:04:41", "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "mJCK1qpsCkKePozYIrIT-g",

Thank goodness they left after 15 min, because even with my headphones in, the lack of carpeting meant that his booming voice was bouncing off the walls like crazy.

Communists!  That's who!!   If they had six stars, I would give seven.  Let me list the reason this is the greatest coffee on the planet\n\n1, Coffee!!!   Excellent, HOT, STRONG, perfect flavor every time.  I don't know about you, but I like my coffee really hot.  I am not sure, but it would not surprise me if they have a small thermonuclear reactor going under those boilers.  Oh, don't like hot.... HOW BOUT THE ICED!!  It's excellent.  \n\n2, Food.  Excellent.  Their Jewish apple cake is the best ever.  Hands down.  They also have excellent salads, soup, and seasonal items like the butternut squash soup.  Wow, that great.  \n\n3. People.  The service is always friendly.  The people always seem happy to be there.  \n\n4. Location.  Now, this is the key for me.  My brother and I were walking 12 years ago when I was helping him move into old town and we walked down this perfect Philly Street only to SMELL the coffee.  The street is like a post card and if you're lucky you can sit outside on a fall day and enjoy your coffee on their tables.  If not, shuffle down to the dog park on one of those benches.  The inside has plenty of seating and it's always clean.  \n\nSo, there you have it.  If it sounds like I love the place, it's because I do and I will make a habit of stopping there whenever I am up from DC. \n\nOh, one thing, you guys have to put the \"WALL OF FAME\" up.  If you're reading this Old City, you know what I am talking about\n\nScottG.\n\nUPDATE\nThe wall of fame is back!!!   Just when you think this place cannot get any getter, it does.

The coffee here is strong and dark and fairly priced. My personal coffee standards are probably a little too high as a result of my frequent patronage, and very few places can really compare.\n\nI like being able to pour my own coffee, although I do wish the various fixings were a little easier to get to (especially as a short person with short arms). Particularly when it's busy, I struggle a bit to reach the stirrers and sleeves, and I often end up reaching over people uncomfortably and feeling in the way while adding my sugar and half&half.\n\nWhen I feel like treating myself to breakfast, a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese is my go-to.

In a crowded market of small-batch roasters, these guys stand out. All the roasts tend towards the darker side, and have a smooth, rich flavor profile. The coffees are lower in acidity and fuller in body than local competitors like Reanimator, which is a plus to me. Old City is the only coffee I drink at home, and the price on whole beans is very reasonable for coffee of this quality. I particularly love and recommend the Balzac Blend.\n\nI haven't tried much of their food, but their muffins and scones are excellent.

The service seems much more like a fast food chain now.  To give an example- the last time I was there I tried to order a 1/2 coffee, 1/2 hot chocolate.  They serve both items and I do not think this is an unreasonable request.  And if the price difference were a problem, I would have been happy to pay the higher price of a full hot chocolate, I'm used to doing that most places.  But instead the server informed me that I actually wanted a mocha.  I told her that I really just want house coffee mixed with hot chocolate.  She replied that my request and a mocha are \"exactly the same thing\".  Obviously this is not true at all, but after repeating myself once more with no luck I decided to just go with it and said OK.  When she called my name I found that my mug contained a shot of espresso at the bottom of a pile of airy milk foam topped with a sickening amount of chocolate syrup.

I absolutely LOVE the Capone sandwich.  It was a lot easier for me to get when they had the Manayunk location, however that still didn't stop me from going out of my way at least once a month to get my fill of The Capone.  Today was my first trip to the new location.  I order the normal...the Capone on wheat bread.  I was then told they were pre made as wraps and that because the owner was there he couldn't make it as a sandwich.  A little annoyed, I took the wrap out of the cooler myself and paid the $11 for a pre made wrap and OJ.  The wrap was TERRIBLE!  How can you pre make something with fresh avocado on it, or the mayo based spread and not expect it to make the greens and wrap soggy and gross?  about half of the way through it I even found a long black hair in my wrap!!!!!!

He was very informative and shared with my husband and I a lot of the information on the Counter Culture Coffee they brew and the thought that goes behind some of their policies.  He showed us a manual pour, and the cup of coffee that we tried was delicious.  He also said he would try asking customers \"what size\" (a complaint I had mentioned earlier) to see if he finds it to be a positive change or not.  I truly appreciated the time and effort he put into meeting with us, and it shows how much he values his customers.  I will definitely give Mugshots another chance!\n\n**\n\nI've been going to Mugshots for almost a year now to grade papers after work, and every once in a while, I find something off, but not really questioned it.  Today I'm convinced that something is definitely off with this coffee shop.  First, I do have to agree with some other reviewers by saying that their coffee really isn't good.  I've had it a couple times, hoping that the burnt taste was just a fluke that day.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Since then, I've just been sticking with their teas, which they do have a large selection of.  I've only had a couple of their cupcakes and bags of chips as far as food goes, and I can't complain about either.\n\nOne thing that I have never experienced in any other cafe besides Mugshots is their automatic upgrade to a medium or large drink if you don't preference what size you want....what?!?  I don't understand the logic of it.  The only explanation I can think of for this is that this is their way to make a few extra cents off each customer, and most of the time it is probably without the customer even knowing.  What audacity for the cafe to put a sign on the counter requesting customers to write a review for them on Yelp, when they do not even have the energy to say, \"what size?\" to each customer.  Again, I just don't get it.\n\nWhy is there a need to put a sign on every SMALL table requesting single-seaters to sit at the bar instead, before they even make that decision if the shop is too full??  It's a turn off before you even sit down.\n\nAnd my final complaint - I purchased a Groupon for $15, which gave me $35 to spend on items after 4pm.  Unfortunately, in the fine print, they state that it has to be used in one visit.  Again....what?!?  I can only compare it to other coffee establishments that I've purchased deals for, and I must say that this is not the case at those places.  I can't think of a reasonable explanation for this, either.  Who really spends $35 at a cafe in one visit???  Most likely, not regular customers.  \n\nI don't feel that Mugshots values or makes any efforts to feel like a cozy, comfortable, neighborhood coffee shop.  I will be looking for another establishment to give my business to ASAP.", "date": "2013-04-02 23:27:05", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "H5lMK9yapcAeL2iFZWw1Ww", "name": "Carol", "review_count": 9, "yelping_since": "2011-11-24 18:58:57", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 4.67, "fans": 0}}

It was before 8am and we were two of three customers in the shop on this dreadfully rainy morning. \n\nKnowing they had some fun bagel options, I had a little fun and picked the jalapeno bagel with goat cheese herb spread. It was like my perfect bagel flavor match. Although to be honest, it didn't really as much resemble a bagel as it did a gourmet sandwich. I thought $3.50 was a little steep of a price but needed the carb-o-load so proceeded. It wasn't super huge in size and they didn't overly schmear it.\n\nThere were two coffee options of the day and the Hologram coffee was the more appealing of the two. It had chocolate undertones and was described as the more traditional coffee option. I thought it reminded me of the fresh version of a fancy K-Cup flavor, but my husband thought it was a little too sweet. \n\nMy husband and I planned on splitting a medium coffee but there was a misunderstanding and the barista poured us a medium and small cup. We didn't catch this until after we were wrung up. The extra charge was removed from my card and she let us keep the extra coffee anyways since it was just going to get tossed. \n\nI enjoyed my fancy bagel and spread, and overall we had an okay experience. I thought the bagels and coffee were overpriced, and as someone who doesn't have a usual need for a coffee shop, I can store this away into the special occasion category.

There hasn't been anything we've tried and didn't like, it's simply the degree of how much we like it - and the organic, locally sourced efforts they make are much appreciated.  \n\nSandwiches etc\nWe've tried many of their sandwiches and all have been good but  the \"Capone (turkey, bacon, avocado wrap) and the \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (chicken, provolone, pesto) are a delicious blend of flavors and textures and so good.\n\nI try to lean a bit toward eating vegan at times and they offer some yummy sandwich options - also love love LOVE their spicy vegan chili - it really has a wonderful kick.   \n\nDesserts\nThey also always seem to have delicious desserts, many vegan things like cupcakes,  huge cowgirl cookies and also I had a vegan whoopie pie there once that was better than any the regular whoopie pie I have ever eaten.  The smoothies are yummy too - I especially like the Strawberry Paradise.\n\nBreakfast\nBreakfast didn't quite do it for me like other meals I've had there but maybe I've ordered the wrong things as hubby raved about the delicious bacon on his sandwich recently.  I had a bagel once that was just ok and an egg and cheese sandwich that I had a hard time seeing  or tasting whatever the cheese was, it seemed mostly just egg - if I got it again I'd ask what my cheese choices are and maybe get something else. They do have some nice (if somewhat warm) fresh squeezed OJ.  \n\nOne negative - we came at 8:30 one night (their website says open til 10 but apparently that has changed to 9) and were brusquely told \"we're closing at 9!\" - we heard this repeated to anyone and everyone they came in contact with and the staff started putting the stools upside down on the counter around 8:40 - I was waiting for them to start wailing out the infamous bar shut down \"you don't have to go home but you can't stay here!\"  - it was rather rude.\n\nWe've only been to the new location a couple of times and it seems to be all 20-somethings whereas the old location always had people of all ages - maybe it's just a weird coincidence? Or did all the older people live on the other side of Fairmount Ave and don't like to cross the street or something? I do wish they'd put in a few old couches and create some cozy little areas. In any case, we'll keep coming back (as long as it's not near 9) - we do like their coffee and food!", "date": "2012-09-04 16:47:36", "useful": 4, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "7uHfPgiMyD7FDDES8_HLlQ", "name": "Holly", "review_count": 112, "yelping_since": "2008-08-27 12:49:38", "friends": ["YUxH_F9jMGAe7PIe8DO34Q", "ckpY2NZ2LDD5PBryBNzkmw", "oXHd9HUOGd9Lk_3nUNDYVA", "CKzYmFIBbIoKyTMWvYXVSQ", "cEDMie5DjE_00sJ23H2q9Q", "PRdB4IOLW4HpW9jjKfLfJw", "bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA", "sTtptFLJ7KdyE_sTi5PhQQ", "oLvIjpLBSaJPuvgZ3BGDEg", "tlV70-IrY9Jll4DS1J0ZmQ", "XQk-XZKwNim2fsc8_LHksA", "8wQIoFapkegkC5fcVYg_Iw", "tKc0TFxVp1qazDrlE-lklQ", "1sH89m2CFbR703kjJ2vA9w", "C972rl04S_Dic69TestOzQ", "BmThnFPDalpbC1x98aXKaw", "5Fjs7GKqFu1Feg6-RufCuA", "y8aWXOimQ9ZgUgZ6q--nCQ", "oPWL7B8k_9zSwtMy6TAhtA", "ei8X5pyCur3d0CGb5EbnFA", "c3Ju0HwICQNnT0ZPHO6gSA", "eJnwyot0rLyWN84DwyC0RA", "Oi1qbcz2m2SnwUeztGYcnQ", "NdSNQXoxiFeNZQ1M6uB9fA", "il4EH5QpVNWcCiz21Ck_WA", "HvOPHE3Aje-rrOP9kzIS6w", "6ZNnGHBEk2ZZctdC0fX8vw", "xXoc8NO_MXq4zHX_N9a0KA", "UJEjJgi1xpmLR4b3J8fn2Q", "rUV1FUhji5xMjNBpcq5SXg", "TYtSCsCo5mF-msQBI-HuHA", "W1eHcjd6kwKAzeFwDoOuJg", "XTHryzjcdqVw7_FVruOYJg", "fEtWwhNKSoTqIWTSEwGIvg", "EZGqZeSsWuxRoQ7Np_FYmA", "_iHbovM6oCm3fTu8ZqTx5Q", "Lb-0y35-vafOkfd9YBWXLA", "fdtIkTfbi0UvvgsSGm98dA", "ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw", "Ys9D6-I3YFaaWkLCu4_YCw", "EuvpcCAJoNB_Mt2JFoFqJw", "8bA7xBnrs5hL9zr49EFznw", "RX0GPUmx4wJ8zxP1Mq0tPA", "PaFm2DT_77jyvnskKC8I_Q", "FuQhthi1rfpFc4FR7YZTLQ", "TY2aJ_EmpM-x-VCXIBIb9A", "mVkopn2FcSNOSrirL84v0w", "ncV3D4quNNIzM4_AiISRbQ", "GucWytLFS6W3hQGDJ_20Ow"], "elite": ["2011", "2012", "2013", "2014"], "average_stars": 3.62, "fans": 6}}

Since I moved to the neighborhood at the beginning of this past summer, I've had three distinct experiences with this coffee shop:\n\nExperience 1:\nIt was the middle of the day. It was hot outside. I had been gallivanting around Fairmount and I wanted something small to eat and also to try one of Mugshots' drinks for the first time. Since it was in the afternoon, I wasn't in the market for coffee. I walked in as a very-perplexed customer and spent a super-long time analyzing their menu.\n\nThe sweet person working answered several of my questions about their drinks and probably thought I was stupid for being so dumb re: basic coffeehouse offerings. Eventually, I decided on a Black Beauty smoothie, which tasted both sweet and healthy (blackberry, boysenberry, blueberry, and yogurt), and also a baconator bagel, whiiiich was.. not healthy. Mm.\n\nExperience 2:\nMugshots was one of the stops on the Great Philadelphia Craft Beer Crawl last month. I did not have coffee during this visit. I had a Yards Pale Ale. It's nice that they participate in community events! They were packed that day. Aaaand that's the extent of Experience 2. Apologies that it wasn't more exciting.\n\nExperience 3:\nTonight! They hosted a free menu tasting and fall celebration event, which equated to a generous spread of cheeses, spreads, hummus, pita, salad, flatbreads (apple butter + mushroom), and french toast. What a great way to bring people in! Standout: the apple butter flatbread. Unique, and I likely never would've thought to order that on my own!\n\nAfter getting a taste of some of their delicious fall offerings, I purchased a blood orange mocha and a cranberry kale salad with organic chicken (~$15 together). The kale salad had a nice lemon-honey dressing on it and it was mixed with shaved parmesan and almonds. I'd definitely get it again. As for the blood orange mocha? Thumbs up x2. It had more of a chocolate taste than blood orange, but it was quality stuff.\n\nI would probably frequent Mugshots more since it's super-super close to me, but I own a Keurig and I love my Keurig. Still, they do host some pretty fun events, their staff has always been very nice, and it also looks like a nice place to stay for awhile with a laptop.

Once, after cheering for my friend at the start line for the marathon, I went to Mugshots to snack and nap while I waited for him to make it to the half-way mark (no joke) and then again after the half-way to the finish (!). There would be a handful of tables and an even smaller amount of plugs for laptops so people would always be clamoring for seats. Now that Mugshots has expanded (many more locations), I was happy to see that you can get something new and something old at all the different Mugshots. \n\nThe new one here at Fairmount is pretty spacious and has a great menu so you can hole up there for breakfast and lunch and not just be eating bagels. There's bar space where you can sit and talk to the baristas or work on you laptop, as well as tons more tables lining the walls to sit and do work. But with all these new seating (and did I mention limited outdoor seating?) the place feels... way less cozy and cool. More like a polished chain with the expensive (for a coffee shop) food and drinks. So that part is sad, but I'm hoping over time they'll get more local art up on the walls and maybe have more comfy chairs and somehow go back to make themselves more unique and interesting. What I'm trying to say is that it's waaay harder to nap at this one. But as a student, that's probably a good thing.", "date": "2012-08-23 15:48:28", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "aGI_wfhcJ86DJ-67Lkty8g", "name": "Di", "review_count": 435,

I wasn't always like this. I used to eat a 50 piece McNugget to myself on a Sunday afternoon before ordering a pizza / stromboli combo. Something happened though. I had a friend that would warn me about pesticides and GMOs and I thought he was crazy but one day I began looking into things. While I still do think he's a little crazy a lot of what he said made sense so I began researching some more.\n\nI'm not a scientist but locally raised and grown organic food is good for the producer, the community, and the consumer. So when we went to Mugshots one Saturday after the gym and I read their chalkboard siting the source and type of all the ingredients they use (ie.

They aren't feeding you some chemical-laden cookie or sandwich delivered to them by a Sysco truck.  They work with multiple vendors including LOCAL FARMERS ya'll to get you some fresh-ass shit while supporting people who aren't being manipulated by huge corporations.  That's a plus in my book.\n\nBottom line: the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere are top notch. \n\n***They also cater!  If you have a work event (or any party really) - order from mugshots.

With a large variety of roasts supplied by counter culture coffee it is always a treat trying the different varieties. My personal favorite is actually a staff recommendation: the cortado. Trust me on this one\n\nThe staff is another great aspect about Mugshots. Never have I ever received such consistently friendly service. Sometimes it is backed up but that is usually during lunch hours or breakfast when they have the most traffic. I remember when I first moved to the city and was looking for good spots to bring my date for lunch I was given a long list of great spots including a pizza shop, small French bistro, and a book store on fairmount that we ended up loosing ourselves in. \n\nThe food has gotten phenomenal over the years especially with the inclusion of the new flat breads like the apple butter and bacon one which helped me recover after new years eve. My favorite however is the quiche and the Capone wrap which are my favorite choices for breakfast and lunch when accompanied by a coffee or smoothie. \n\nI'd recommend this coffee shop to my friends and keep it secret from my enemies.

They started down the street - across the Eastern State Penitentiary - and are now between 19 and 20 on Fairmount Ave. The quality of the coffee is what always brings me back here (yes, it is AWESOME!). Featuring Counter Culture Coffees is what does it! The coffee and espresso drinks never cease to be enjoyable. And their friendly staff know how to talk about coffee without coming across as condescending. Plus the drinks are always beautifully presented. (By the way try their traditional cappuccino; it is amazing!!) Over the past few months they have also started to carry a couple of other brands of coffee as well (Yay, for starting to carry ReAnimator!!!) which makes this a happily unusually shop in the coffee industry. I highly suggest stopping in and asking one of the baristas to do a pourover for you, they will let you choose any coffee that is for sale! \n\nOn a final note, the menu here is amazing! The overwhelming selection of food makes it the perfect place to stop in and grab a bite.  And if you are  vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free... no worries.

I want there to be food that is inventive, well executed, healthy, local, and I want options. I want enough space that I don't feel guilty for sitting down for more than 5min. Everything else is negotiable. Mugshots delivers in all categories-to the point that I have given up making my daily cup at home and driving there every morning before work to get an excellent cup of hot or iced and to have my favorite baristas (Garrett and Rose you complete me) remember what I want, how I want it, and keep me up to date with the local hijinks.

However, I have some real problems with this place that just seem to be getting worse. First of all, this place needs a good scrub down and update. The floors are dusty and filthy and the tables and chairs look like clawed cats have lived on them for quite some time. Also, while most of the baristas are very friendly like the guy with the long hair and all of the girls, there's one guy with a mustache and a beanie who is consistently rude. The issue is that he is almost always there, so unfortunately I must avoid this coffee shop if I'm not in the mood to have a rude encounter. Also, there is no designated area to put your dirty dishes, so after you're done with your coffee and/or food you're left with the daunting task of deliberating over whether you should leave your dishes on the table, or place them on the same bar that other people are being served their coffee on, which I think is gross. But, the guy with the mustache gives me attitude if I leave my stuff on the table, so unless I want a nasty stink eye and a passive aggressive comment the next time I come in I am obligated to carry my dishes across the shop and place them beside someone's fresh coffee. Kinda makes me feel like a kid who got in trouble on the playground...not what I came for. Also, new employees should be trained before opening or after closing as opposed to serving customers sub-par coffee all day until they've got it right. I personally don't want to pay four dollars for coffee that's just okay. Otherwise, the sandwiches, bagels, salads, and yogurt were consistently quite good, but they often ran out of pastries or only had little brioches left or something a little old and stale that just wouldn't hit the spot. Ultimately, I don't think I'll be back. Good coffee and food doesn't cut it for me when the rest of my experience is too often simply not enjoyable.", "date": "2017-12-16 20:52:27", "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "qKKvOhE8GhON-juhaOHmBA", "name": "Suzanne", "review_count": 1, "yelping_since": "2012-02-12 20:40:21", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 2.0, "fans": 0}}

Customers bring dogs into the cafe. Today the barista walked around the counter and pet a customers small hairy dog for a few mins, kissing it etc. Then goes back to making drinks. If you are allergic to animals or have taken college biology you know how offensive that is on so many levels. \n\nIssue#2: Internet, outlets and noise. Internet is on and off, dropping out every few mins. No Outlets for laptops. NONE. And way to noisey, braistas take pride in banging the espresso handles and the acoustics of the place amplify the sound. I don't expect a library, but the noise here is noticeably annoying. This place needs a make over...yesterday. Need a new bar, some outlets and better lighting.  \n\nIssue#3: Offerings. Coffee is reasonably priced $2.50 with $0.50 cent refills, but its way too strong (almost sludge status). Its not bad...just not for light roasted drinkers. My friend who likes dark roast, loved his coffee. Pastries are unreasonably expensive. Rock hard, ok tasting biscotti for $2. $3 for a tart etc. Have not tried sandwiches but after seeing the staff pet the dog, I will pass on the food.  \n\nStaff is nice, but kinda aloof. No small talk, usually on their phones or straight to the point. The crowd here is older regulars and well heeled locals. In summer with windows open it is a nice place to hang and have a conversation.

The current operation does not come close to it's predecessor.  The espresso shots are tight and short.  I mean $2.50 for a one ounce, down the hatch in seconds shot that is pulled according to the very know-it-all barista for 18 seconds (or less).  That's nonsense, and when I told him so, he told me his boss would get mad if he pulled a longer shot!  His Boss!  I'm the customer, and if I think a thimbleful of espresso is too tight, loosen the grip.  So then he proceeds to ask if I wanted him to add more to my cup.  You can't do that, and he knows it.  So he pulls a second shot, and this one is about and ounce and a half.  When he sees that I'm not happy, he proceeds, even though I'm telling him never mind, to make a third, obviously over extracted shot of mediocre espresso.  All the while telling me that he's, \"read books on espresso.\"  When I tell him I have a $1000 setup at home, he starts asking me questions about it as if to make sure I'm giving him the truth.

There aren't a myriad of options, but you know when the menu isn't full of craziness, the quality is really the thing to enjoy. I think the prices are reasonable and not overly ridiculous. When is a great coffee place super cheap? Never! I can't comment on the food- never had it, but it always sounds delish :)\n\nStaff & Service: As one yelper mentioned- unpretentious! They are always so nice, kind and cool. It's a hipster/laid back/ chill vibe. They always seem really cool- like \"ooo I could be his/her friend!\"\n\nAtmosphere: This is where I feel like the shop falls a LITTLE short. I like my coffee places where it's warm and snuggly- this place doesn't give me that vibe at all. I'd much prefer to come here over the summer vs. winter. For me it's not an ideal place to post-up and study, there aren't too many tables and the place lacks in outlets to charge. Volvo isn't big and there are no comfy big chairs/couches, only wooden chairs & tables. Mainly 2-person tables. There is lots of great lighting, but because the place is so small, whenever the door opens it sometimes gets pretty chilly. I kept my coat on most of the time. In the summer there are fun places to sit outside and it is a good place to get a coffee with a friend or two and talk. Just not really study place (limited room, not the warm snuggly atmosphere I like). \n\nParking: There is metered street, but if you go on the side streets for free, you can find a place as long as you are ok with walking a few blocks to get there.\n\nOverall- I know I'll be back, I am giving 3 stars based on the atmosphere part.", "date": "2014-12-07 01:31:53", "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool":

Found street parking in front (it was a Tuesday morning) and was charmed by the high ceilings and light interior. Loved the decor. Ordered a large soy vanilla latte with an extra espresso shot (total of 4 shots), and a toasted multigrain bagel with butter. The latte was ok. Nothing special but perfectly fine. I love strong lattes, and It didn't taste like it had four shots of espresso, but it was ok. \n\nThe bagel however, was just plain bad. Awful. Had zero flavor. The butter added some much-needed saltiness but it was possibly the most bland multigrain bagel I've had in a very long time. I wasn't going to complain to the staff about a measly bagel but I won't ever be ordering it again. Hard to know if their other food is prepared as blandly. Hopefully it's just the brand of bagel they use. Probably should have ordered a pastry instead. \n\nI rarely go to Manyunk so I'm not sure if and when I'd return here. It's always a great addition to a neighborhood to have a coffeehouse, so I'm glad it's there.

Second, you get the feeling the crowd is a little more put together then the ones that go to the chain coffee shop down the street (I go to both, depends on my mood, parking, and how much time I want to spend)..sometimes it feels a little elitist or pretentious in here, admittingly I'm looking for that sometimes.  The customer service beef i have is that it takes FOREVER to pay for something, the other reason is a one time incident but left a bad taste in my mouth...and has given me mixed feelings about going in... sitting in the car outside of Volo a few min early one day and a woman with a baby in her stroller tried to open the door, the two people in there looked at her and totally ignored her!

This was very good and quite filling. It was a real egg and not one from the freezer or that you would get at Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. I was disappointed with the iced mocha that I got. It tasted just like milk. I couldn't taste any espresso. I didn't want to go back to the counter as the line was out the door (which is a good thing but not for me at that point). It was $5 and not worth it. My friend ordered a hot chocolate and the barista was nice enough to let her know that they use bittersweet chocolate so they would sweeten it to her liking.

Apparently it's so popular that it's difficult to find seating.  We walked around a little more and then returned 30 minutes later to snag a perfect two-person table.  The atmosphere is quite modern and open, not like your warm neighborhood Starbucks, so it depends on the vibe you want.  Because it's one, fairly small open room, it did get rather noisy - particularly when a poor dishwasher smashed an entire tray of dishes on the floor.  I'm able to tune out the background noise, while my husband is not - so know you're party's preferences.  I appreciated that they had a surge protector near a cluster of tables so that more than two people could charge their laptops; mine has a gimpy battery that dies after fifteen minutes without electricity, so I factor outlets into my coffee shop assessments.  If you don't need an outlet, you can sit outside when the weather's nice and people watch while you sip your drink of choice.\n\nBut the coffee - oh wow.  I ordered a small half-caf iced coffee, and my husband got a hot vanilla latte in a mug.  The cashier was nice when I asked if they could make it half-caf, even though I know coffee snobs turn their nose up at that - but he probably saw my pregnant belly.  We paid $7-$8, which is a little steep for liquid calories, but it was worth the taste.  We only waited three minutes, despite the volume of customers.  The latte came out first, and it was beautifully topped with swirled, decorated foam.  It wasn't too sweet, but you could still taste the vanilla - a lovely balance.  The barista serving my iced coffee made sure to say \"half-caf\" with a nice smile, which reassured me that they had made it properly.  I added cream and sugar (I only add sugar to my iced coffee, okay?!) at the bar from a cute little tray they provide.  I only wish they had two trays on busy days or at high volume times, because I had to ask the woman next to me who was waiting for her coffee to make room so I could reach the cream.  \n\nWe didn't order any food, since we'd just had lunch, but I would love to go back and try their food.  They had a three-cheese grilled cheese that sounded really good, and the salads on another ladies' table looked sizable.  I'd say there were about five-six sandwiches, three-four salads, maybe a soup, and several baked goods on the menu.  A co-worker tells me that their multi-grain bagels slathered with butter are the best he's had, and he's a Philly native.  Actually, a couple of my co-workers come into work most mornings with a cup of Volo joe, despite our office providing very good coffee.\n\nGreat coffee, decent value, distinct atmosphere, located in the heart of walkable Manayunk.", "date": "2015-08-28 19:03:15", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "user": {"user_id": "2CqPbi4bn1-TQy4J-oN6cA", "name": "Kacey", "review_count": 19, "yelping_since": "2015-07-06 20:08:00", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.9, "fans": 1}}

When all you have is a simple cup, without milk, sugar, foams and flavor extracts there is no room to hide anything. All that will matter is where the beans are from, what the roaster did to them, and whether the water was high quality and at the proper temperature. Nothing else. I cannot tell you how many times I've gone into a trendy coffee shop and walked away disappointed because the product is lackluster.\n\nVolo surpasses that test, and does it in spades. Their house blend is a bit lighter than I usually like ( I typically am a fan of dark, DARK roasts) but they managed to get a very nice amount of flavor, with low astringency and I'm convinced that I need to try their espresso. (which is my secondary test) While they are not particularly my wheelhouse, the last time I visited my companion had a green tea latte which was artfully prepared, and considered tasty.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor it great as well, as the large windows in the front give the location plenty of light and the high ceilings prevent you from feeling claustrophobic. The art scattered around gave plenty to provide some excitement to the walls and the staff was relatively friendly.

It was 10:15 on a Sunday morning and we didn't have to wait in line for coffee?!?! Us Center City dwellers did not understand this but we liked it very much. We ordered a Latte and a House Coffee and were very satisfied when we realized that they brewed La Columbe coffee. We'd much rather patronize a coffeehouse like Volo over the Starbucks and other chains in the city. You could tell the baristas took pride in their work and they were speedy, helpful, and nice. There is plenty of tables to sit down if you are looking to relax with a friend or come here to get some work done.

I will get the important stuff out of the way first:\n\nBEST COFFEE I HAVE HAD IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nBEST ICED COFFEE IVE EVER HAD (not to mention price)\n\nBEST PANINI IVE EVER HAD (classic)\n\nONE OF THE BEST SALADS (salmon)\n\nGREATEST ATMOSPHERE EVER AT A COFFEE SHOP\n\nOkay if you're still with me here are the deets.  I was a regular here from 2004-2008 while I was in school.  Back then it was La Colombe, The LC.  This was my stop.  I wasn't overrun by classmates.  I could stay for 8 hours and not feel like a jerk.  I had my little spot, next to Charlie's table, in the corner just by the door.  8-Noon was a Cappuccino.  Noon-4 was a Classic Panini and an Iced Coffee.  On nice days I'd grab a table on the sidewalk for the best outdoor seating spot in Philly.  It really is perfect.  \n\nYears later I still stopped by whenever I went to Manayunk.  It was literally like visiting my parents house.  Everyone there has always been super nice and really fun.  There are a lot of artists in Manayunk so you'd see them stop buy for breaks.  The window-wash guy alway came buy and had a chat.  The aforementioned icon Charlie was maybe the greatest guy in the world.  It just always felt right.\n\nBack then LC downtown was known for being the European coffee shop because you walked into a wall of smoke and it was so busy it had the sense of gruffness that comes with high traffic.  It had it's own appeal.  But LC/Volo has always been a little bit of Paris.  Clean, quiet, awesome music, GREAT COFFEE, great people.  \n\nWhen I got married we served La Colombe coffee at our wedding.  Even today living in SF we have it shipped every month.  It's just the best on so many levels.  \n\nIf life is so busy you can only grab and go still come by-- it's also the cheapest coffee in town.  But if you can, preferably on a weekday, stop in around 10am and stay until you nip off somewhere for happy hour around closing.  Bring a good book, maybe some music (unless Tenzen is still there jamming radiohead), and get comfy.  Over the course of the day you'll see the waves of people come by like episodes in a show-- the cyclists clicking around (they always know where the good coffee is), the artists getting the day started at 1pm, the moms bringing the kids in after school for a hot chocolate, the after work crowd swinging in to grab a seat outside to let some stress melt away (that's how I ran into Darren Aronofsky, Shane Victorino, and the better part of the CSC racing team!). \n\nI can't explain it in any other way than to say that is just fun, it's always fun and feels right.  It's almost like it shouldn't exist in America.  Sure the coffee's great, sure it's a unique spot in the world of franchised coffees hops.  But if you really want to enjoy it, to see why it's still run by the same awesome guy all this time and the same people come in every day, come in and stay a while.", "date": "2013-10-17 05:08:28", "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "user": {"user_id": "q90nV9qHGlr0zwhoDtoYjA", "name": "Kory", "review_count": 27, "yelping_since": "2012-06-08 14:18:05", "friends": ["oXBbNQNSuEtkU-ZSTVuHuA", "r6Q_VRw6VsUfIkO-G7q-wg", "qIJGy4K8Mh8WgWWwFuOctA", "y4oMRaj5IPvcwJY5HBFQmw"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 3.77, "fans": 2}}

I went on one online date already, the first time I tried to get out there and meet people after the end of my 14-year marriage with my ex-wife (Cynthia). She now lives with our twin sons (Bradley and Bryan) in Glenside. \n\nI was pretty scared to go on another online date, since the first one fizzled out. But I figured I would try again after Tonya M. reached out to me. It seemed like we had a lot of similar interests. She said that she liked to read and I at one point thought about maybe writing professionally before deciding upon a career as an actuary. I currently develop risk valuation models for parking garages across North America (our company works with a firm with Canadian assets). \n\nIt went really well with Tonya M. I was up front and told her about the divorce with Cynthia, how much of it was my fault because I hid behind my career due to my fears of being a husband and father. My own dad was TERRIFIC and was always there for me and imparted many valuable life lessons. I never thought I would live up to his standards and I ended up not doing so. (There is hurt on both sides of the split, however.)\n\nTonya M. understood quite a bit and said that we all make mistakes. She confessed to me something she didn't put in her profile -- she was starting her life over, too. \n\nShe had spent a little under two years in jail for voter fraud. \n\nTonya M. and I had an enjoyable conversation and have left the possibilities open for a second date elsewhere in Northwest Philadelphia. I'm not sure how I feel about dating a woman with a police record, but like she said, we all make mistakes. Also, it was a white-collar crime done at the behest of her then-boss. \n\nVolo Coffeehouse was TERRIFIC. Just great coffee and a wonderful atmosphere right on Main Street. It was cozy (and had a lot of bike riders) but still a great place.\n\nI would recommend Volo Coffeehouse to anyone in Philadelphia who is going on an OK Cupid date with a woman who has committed voter fraud in an attempt to rig a suburban school board election.", "date": "2014-04-01 19:03:29", "useful": 6, "funny": 28, "cool": 2, "user": {"user_id": "r8GpBm9dbvBpciwnafPqmw", "name": "Karl", "review_count": 32, "yelping_since": "2014-03-22 05:23:34", "friends": ["r636kd302eGgDGuS-dR4bQ", "eeUtUOk5ivYk2EN2vyL_Lw", "VlUP7H6WvXpYHCNJQnoPOQ", "Wh-PbbdbeYlyOGumxTwFJg", "IyTBI7li0LpqEqyWbrqhqw", "KfXBB-BdqTAdWYRxkLA7gg", "pgfhOdPKiRsU9f-bf4KPFA", "Jzhgb976kv8W_0-KRjg7pg", "gKQ9FrHOmvngL2w1-vILvw", "n9Z7YGPBqSgmSokSD87PTw", "WMEOjlCh70GCc6cqPnnFbA", "qZ8xjRYUlljRmXtoa2eHuw", "dxWP5T7Sl9l7IsYkEUElyA", "y66pJSfhMmJ2EFI3E95RGg", "7lS6-qSkgjTRwDBiFtmPOQ", "YD72_HTGxfkoDdPQCayj1A", "FkY-Qg5armK-bXa7-Je7iw", "s8C7D6o_KI199rZYSFWjKw", "a5jfU9i0ETqAjRkBdNIv1Q", "L8FQB93s3HEd8vDMP2W76Q", "UqqPJ76rmwEkkGywxHj4bw", "yXWEV5zOsYMrNJcgtVD5lA", "2AkZF9XoqwwoPlk55icKMQ", "-MQH1Un-HiMTuRmkycKmBQ", "A3v4mtWlnaYZpHKKqzNhJg", "kemZ-AbYgTXT6_3EarmCSg", "xIT4G8FMD0EXVwF-WWdG9A", "Wr6T7e4dVGvS8vQSNLxWHw", "orACKjn73VRHjpRV6GvQbw", "2iYJea0bNp9WJ3nVeg-pdQ", "ZD_Ojqmmfb-FjTf5kbYvyw", "ynK_4lHrkqdXSHdrtQdq6g", "13O-RqRakinVeOmc2jcrWg", "Rn6M2pam65SdTlZ50sXdtg", "JtYXYMu0WauDoz778Zc6ZA", "PnQdnMneO4ad2bC14TEkKQ", "l14TwBDqCiNYFP45XT0Nbw", "5zd8nbY9szXc8w8mNEhOgA", "J7L5EbWEHB8njkFjZkas7w", "dDec1koeBnGo0YC2aQ18gg", "EVzjNwYED2hsziHnc7AYbA", "Y08ceeuszsVjcggjiwQ5dw", "vZ2Wl8pZAAKzfottRZtc5A", "zQQVdEul8vXOMXyd8AITrw", "0KAogGdnMyJYR_n25Op-yA", "tQ0afdvRDwFSnpU01x772w", "b3nHSjiWkh_sEVBKtzXhOw", "aqADTeq3QIkZVGZljDYVUw", "lutRz0WlXDOnTYJj46e1lg", "xZAXhDxQ5M60HLNEuz529g", "bx3K2C6XhLMu9uG1ST2G4A", "-C3b8J6wDKSHqzWJhQkmAA", "wSByVbwME4MzgkJaFyfvNg", "ES6bZlyBOvNU5ql9mftfhQ", "VEfuttZS2u51EWfRBQOX1w", "OIFyFGmstj4jcf5hP4QRdw", "5bTQVMpYHtDjCPKXYN2A4A", "TB2u_EiTZSNh0tbkzv--8Q", "kY2IvXTFgam-vNCRTOj-yg", "BAxQ81yiPleNmfcCgCoqQg", "HBLDsdGpWd13cnu6hoeR5w", "XHI_G_ZJrBaFjyn07N1hXA", "96JZapwKFbOc5MrXLh8E2w", "CrZUl0CI1ahve5H-dNdkPQ", "fOwrVoNeJrieRlzLEasSKg", "JGvikgiCl2WCsrYG86rRxQ", "BB7iAAA3XlHHRj5_wc9wYQ", "yp_ohcxyxHL4roZIfztL4g", "JAad4tQuVbhk1x-N5hdfeg", "h17lOryBhtVR8gBSGglIVA", "yM2m1VixYSJBCwrTiqFADw", "DYW1GOyvZ-r_yJzgy-oM6g", "-Cmkm_W2wq67GwdQM_xI9Q", "Jc6g999s6t_8A3Ho11VLng", "Sj-pHb0fy66m58D-Uu6RQA", "_vqBErKDBU6_6GJHFUE0yQ", "6KI-p5SquwxDuP7TwNKrKw", "cIl5hR1FRdew-6dYOpnIbQ", "x1FH_zjy7W3NVLplYsdlDw", "kZCA14xE7ZHo6F3vhp5Jpw", "zs5PMIZfjeY0hQvkKVunKg", "JuqKAyTjrhX1_wq-ychJ6A", "OGXaxh9Qg9HQSlNpk1h2Ig", "tRWJ5ITiSN0b9u_F6r2wBw", "TcsaJM56vsQuE8wzq_jFqw", "2m15QBhZrHKBnUiU_LG9Fw", "c9kbgFM9uxrQn5p_AdGfgg", "-qAclSsHrtXjSpjlKhcu-g", "z-a_N-w7xR_xpo30QoValA"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 5.0, "fans": 82}}

Used to be a la colombe, which is a world cllass coffee roaster. The owner retained the original elements and simply changed name.  HUGE windows to look out of while sipping coffee or tea.

I hesitate to discuss the pastry selection because it's nearly as addicting as the coffee, pssttt...raisin danish is 5 stars.\n\nWorkers can handle the massive line in the morning so don't worry they'll set up your order faster than you think.\n\nDon't expect to order crazy fraps and syrups because they focus on the coffee old school. Drip coffee, cappuccino, latte and espresso are my favorites.\n\nThe neighborhood is very nice for grabbing to go and walking around.\n\nAlso, usually, there is a table of folks that meet in the morning. They are very friendly and asked me to join them to talk about general topics.  Stuff like this is rare and shows the place a great vibe.\n\nThey really try to relate to the community with take one/leave one books and \ncork board with everything from dog sitting, babysitting, apartment rentals and local shows.\n\nI visit about 3-4 times per week on my way to the city. \n\n0 stars, I give 5 galaxies!", "date": "2019-01-27 12:11:14", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "user": {"user_id": "wKpiL34UD5bRccE8uUF1ag", "name": "Michael", "review_count": 4, "yelping_since": "2018-12-12 01:31:44", "friends": ["None"], "elite": [], "average_stars": 5.0, "fans": 0}}

I went Saturday looking for a really good iced soy chai (a favorite of mine) and brought a book. This place had that perfect grab something delicious, get lost in what you're doing or who you're with vibe. It helped that it was raining outside, very seattle :) I grabbed a tea and a recommended almond croissant-YUM, a must get without a doubt- sat down to read and didnt leave for hours.\nCame back Sunday with a friend, much more packed at exactly the same time so be aware Sundays are brutal! The latte may be one of the best I have ever had. I may have to start hiking it over here before work in the mornings. And of course I grabbed another almond croissant! although the cinnamon roll and the apple tart were both calling my name...\nBe aware, it is a small place, Any more than two people will be tought to find a table.
