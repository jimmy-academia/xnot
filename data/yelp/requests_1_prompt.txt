**2. Item Metadata**:
   - categories (cuisine type)
   - stars (overall rating)
   - attributes (parking, outdoor, wifi, etc.)
   - city, hours

**3. Reviewer Metadata**:
   - elite status (expert opinion weight)
   - friends list (trust network)
   - review_count (experience level)
   - average_stars (reviewer tendency)

**4. Review Metadata**:
   - stars (per-review rating)
   - date (recency)
   - useful/funny/cool votes (community validation)

## Request Schema
```json
{
  "id": "R0",
  "text": "Natural language user request...",
  "structure": {
    "op": "AND|OR",
    "conditions": [
      {"aspect": "aspect_name", "level": "MUST|SHOULD|NICE", "source": "review_text|item_meta|reviewer_meta|review_meta"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Levels:**
- MUST: Non-negotiable (fail = reject restaurant)
- SHOULD: Important preference (affects score)
- NICE: Bonus (never penalizes)

## Requirements
1. Generate exactly 20 requests (R0-R19)
2. **Mix aspect sources** - don't only use review text:
   - Include 3+ requests using reviewer trust (e.g., "weight elite reviewers higher")
   - Include 3+ requests using item metadata (e.g., "must have parking", "Italian cuisine")
   - Include 2+ requests using review metadata (e.g., "recent reviews only")
3. **Vary complexity**:
   - 4 simple (1 condition)
   - 6 medium (2-3 conditions with AND)
   - 6 complex (3+ conditions with AND/OR)
   - 4 nested (AND containing OR or vice versa)
4. Natural, realistic user language in "text" field
5. Cover the aspects that appear frequently in the data

Output as a JSON array.
